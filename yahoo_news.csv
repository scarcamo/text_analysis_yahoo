They said this was outdoors—it’s not! They lied to us,” Rogen ranted from he stage that year, going off-script. “We’re in a hermetically-sealed tent right now. I would not have come to this. Why is there a roof? It’s more important that we have three chandeliers than that we make sure we don’t kill Eugene Levy tonight. That is what has been decided.” “This is insane!” he concluded.",1,[],2025-01-06 03:19:55,2025-01-06 20:05:41

Celebrity couples were among the famous attendees to walk the Golden Globes red carpet. Leighton Meester and Adam Brody wore coordinating outfits, while the Sandlers' looks stood out. On Sunday, Hollywood's biggest stars arrived at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in California for the 82nd annual Golden Globes, hosted by comedian Nikki Glaser. Celebrity couples wore some of the most fashionable outfits of the night, arriving in coordinating and complementary looks. From Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco to Viola Davis and Julius Tennon, here's a look at the best outfits worn by celebrity couples on the Golden Globes red carpet. Leighton Meester and Adam Brody The longtime couple arrived in different shades of green. Brody wore an emerald suit from Prada. It consisted of a double-breasted jacket and coordinating pants. He wore a white flower on his lapel. Meester's sage gown from Versace was figure-hugging with a cowl neckline and a subtle sparkle. Adam Sandler and Jackie Sandler The Sandlers both wore black to the Golden Globes. Jackie Sandler's Tom Ford dress was backless, and the halter neckline was attached with a gold choker. The bodice featured a cutout that flowed nearly to her waist while a train extended behind her. Adam Sandler's look was monochromatic, as he paired a black shirt and tie with his suit. Mary Steenburgen and Ted Danson Danson, who was honored with the Carol Burnett Award at this year's Golden Globes, walked the red carpet in a navy tuxedo and a velvet bow tie. The strapless neckline of Steenburgen's black dress had a square cutout in the center, contrasting with the white flowers that adorned the bodice. She wore a black scarf around her neck, flowing behind her like a train. Viola Davis and Julius Tennon Tennon walked the red carpet in a traditional suit and sneakers, keeping his outfit simple to let his wife shine. Davis, who was given the Golden Globes' Cecil B. DeMille Award, wore a black sparkly gown with a dazzling cape across her shoulders. The cape shined with rainbow colors as she walked beneath the event's lights. Hannah Bagshawe and Eddie Redmayne Bagshawe and Redmayne both wore patterned looks to the Golden Globes. Bagshawe's long-sleeve dress was taupe, and it featured billowy sleeves that cinched at the wrist with ruffles, as did the high neckline. Gold polka dots adorned the dress, and the skirt had tiers of ruffles, creating a maximalist look. Redmayne's black-and-white look consisted of a checked jacket and pants paired with a cream top. He wore the shirt with the collar popped up and completed the outfit with black shoes. Miles Teller and Keleigh Sperry Teller Miles Teller kept his look classic, donning a black tuxedo for the Golden Globes. Keleigh Sperry Teller's semi-sheer blue dress was covered in intricate beading. Velvet fabric sat atop the halter neckline, offsetting a cutout in the center of the bodice. Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco The newly engaged couple coordinated their elegant looks. Gomez wore a dusty-blue gown with off-the-shoulder sleeves and extra fabric that she draped across her arm, while Blanco stood beside her in a fuzzy white suit and a matching shirt embellished with lace detailing. Sebastian Stan and Annabelle Wallis Stan brought a fun twist to classic menswear with a long suit jacket and skinny trousers — both of which had white stripes down each side. Wallis stood out in a sparkling pink gown with a corseted bodice and ruched neckline. Read the original article on Business Insider",0,[],2025-01-06 03:19:55,2025-01-06 20:05:51

Following a steep downfall in public opinion polls and an unhappy caucus calling on him to quit, three sources told the Canadian newspaper that while they don’t know exactly when Trudeau would announce his resignation, it is likely to happen before a key national caucus meeting on Wednesday. The newspaper added that it would not be identifying the sources as they “were not authorized to discuss internal party matters.” One of the sources, who claimed to have spoken recently to Trudeau, said that the prime minister acknowledges that he has to make the announcement before he meets the Liberal caucus so that it doesn’t look like he was edged out by his own party members. The three sources also added that they are unsure of who would replace Trudeau as the Liberal Party’s leader after his resignation, noting that it’s not clear whether or not he’ll leave immediately upon his resignation or stay on until a new leader is selected. The Liberal Party national executive group is slated to meet this week, according to The Globe and Mail. While Trudeau had been facing pressure from his party for some time now, tensions were exacerbated on Dec. 16 after his finance minister and deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland surprisingly resigned, citing spending gimmicks and a lack of serious initiative in dealing with President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs as reasons. Trudeau’s silence on the matter sparked concern amongst Liberal members of parliament who renewed their calls for him to leave. The Atlantic, Ontario, and Quebec caucuses have all claimed that the majority of their membership no longer supports Trudeau, per The Globe and Mail. Those three regions account for 131 of the Liberal party’s seats in the House of Commons. The party holds 153 seats to begin with. According to The Globe and Mail, Trudeau reportedly told Liberal members of parliament that he would reflect on his future but would not announce any decision over the holidays. The newspaper adds that his closest advisors have been meeting with senior Liberals over the past two weeks to determine whether or not Trudeau can remain as leader of the party and Prime Minister until he is replaced.",824,[],2025-01-06 03:19:55,2025-01-06 20:06:00
https://news.yahoo.com/news/entertainment/nikki-glaser-worried-her-diddy-021547568.html,Nikki Glaser was worried her Diddy joke wouldn't land at the Golden Globes. She went for it anyway.,,Entertainment,INSIDER,2 min read,"Nikki Glaser prepared heavily for her Golden Globes hosting gig. She expressed hesitation over telling a Diddy joke, but went for it anyway.",Palmer Haasch,2025-01-06T02:15:47.000Z,"Nikki Glaser hosted the 2025 Golden Globes. Compared to Jo Koy last year, her monologue killed it. Despite expressing worry over a Diddy joke in the press, Glaser went for it on stage. Glaser said that she ran her monologue many times in clubs before doing it on the Globes stage. At last year's Golden Globes, comedian Jo Koy defended his poorly received opening monologue by saying that he only had 10 days to write it. In 2025, his successor Nikki Glaser — who was also nominated for best performance in stand-up comedy on television — showed up prepared. She still took some risks onstage, though. Glaser's monologue took shots at streamers like Paramount+ (which is streaming the awards show), Netflix, and Peacock, viral moments like the viral Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo ""holding space"" meme, and somewhat surprisingly, the rapper Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, who will stand trial in May on a sex-trafficking indictment. ""That movie was more sexually charged than Diddy's credit card,"" Glaser said of the Zendaya-led film ""Challengers,"" prompting laughter from the crowd. ""I'm sorry. I'm upset too,"" Glaser continued. ""The afterparty's not gonna be as good this year, but we have to move on. ""Stanley Tucci 'freak off' just doesn't have the same ring to it. No baby oil this year, just lots of olive oil,"" she said, referencing the allegations of sex performances and baby oil usage found in Combs' indictment, and Tucci's proclivity toward Italian food. Glaser ran through her monologue dozens of times in clubs ahead of the Globes. The New York Times reported that during one of those runs, Glaser expressed hesitation about telling a joke about Combs at the show despite it landing with the club audience. ""You promise you will still be hollering on your couch when it dies in the room? I don't think you will,"" Glaser told the audience after someone urged her to keep it in her monologue. Glaser told the Times the following day that she felt it was ""almost more important"" that the jokes in her monologue land for the people in the room than audiences at home. ""I don't know if I'm savvy enough to watch a joke that bombs on TV and still go: That's still a good joke,"" Glaser said. Luckily for Glaser, her joke about Combs — and later in the monologue, another crack about the possibility of other, yet-to-be-uncovered celebrity criminals in the room — landed with the in-person audience. The rest of her opening was a hit for Globes attendees and those on social media as well. ""Nikki Glaser is very very good at this,"" ""Daily Show"" host Jon Stewart wrote on X.

But beyond there being a near-instant unanimous decision that the Challengers and Dune: Part Two star is the night’s best-dressed celebrity in her dramatic burnt-orange Louis Vuitton gown—a nod to Old Hollywood star Joyce Bryant—there was something else about the look that elicited gasps from keen-eyed fans. Um, Zendaya, what is that on your left hand’s ring finger? As photos of Zendaya, who was nominated at Sunday night’s ceremony, flooded social media, users quickly zoomed in on the large, diamond-looking ring on the actress’s engagement finger. Could it possibly be a subtle announcement that she and longtime boyfriend Tom Holland are now engaged? There’s been no official statement on that. So in lieu of any real confirmation, the next logical thing is happening: People are absolutely freaking out online speculating about it. Holland wasn’t on the red carpet with Zendaya. In fact, a recent quote of his went viral—alongside a photoshoot of him looking absolutely ripped—in which he explained that he often doesn’t walk carpets with Zendaya “because it’s not my moment, it’s her moment.” When he joins her, he said, “it’s about us.” Whether or not the massive rock on that ring finger means engagement, at the very least Zendaya can celebrate being with a man who is a one-man parade of Green Flags.

The frigid conditions are already impacting travel. Snow is forecast for Washington, DC, as the area prepares for the Trump administration transition. Blizzards, ice storm warnings, and unpleasantly cold conditions are blowing into much of the northern US, with major impacts expected by Monday morning. The Arctic outbreak, dubbed Winter Storm Blair by the Weather Channel, will bring heavy snow to areas in the mid-Atlantic area that haven't had such weather in a decade, the National Weather Service warned. Kansas City, for instance, could get up to a foot of snow by the end of the weekend. In the mid-south, the NWS warns that freezing rain could result in power outages. More than 100,000 power outages have so far been reported across Missouri, Illinois, and Kentucky, leaving residents in the region in the dark and without heat, per The Weather Channel. And snow — possibly mixed with sleet and freezing rain — could reach 10 inches in Washington, DC, where preparations are underway for Donald Trump's incoming administration and where the election results are set to be certified Monday. DC Mayor Muriel Bowser on Sunday declared a snow emergency which will remain in effect in the area until at least the end of the day on Tuesday, January 7, according to a press release from Bowser's office. Additional cold weather warnings have also been issued in Baltimore, Cincinnati, Louisville, Kentucky, and St. Louis, with officials warning to limit travel in the impacted areas, The Weather Channel reported. The Governors of West Virginia and Kentucky have also declared a state of emergency across their jurisdictions, providing additional resources for road clearing and responding to emergencies. Local news outlet WCHS-TV reported that officials in both states were backed up responding to crashes and calls for help from first responders. In all, about half the US population is expected to experience freezing temperatures over the next week, Axios reported. More than 8,600 flights had on Sunday been either delayed or canceled due to the storm, per Forbes, including triple-digit flight cancellations for Kansas City (MCI), St. Louis Lambert (STL), and Dallas-Forth Worth (DFW) airports. The numbers of impacted flights are expected to continue to rise. Airlines including American, Delta, Southwest, and United said they are waiving change fees for flights impacted by the storm.

But Glaser saved her most pointed bit for last, predicting that it would be “memorable night” because five years from now, people would be watching clips on YouTube, spot someone in the crowd and think, “Oh my god, that was before they caught that guy.” “We could be making history tonight and we don’t even know with who,” she said. “He knows. Or she. It could be a woman. I think a hundred percent of the time it’s a man, but it could be a woman. Won’t be. It never is. Kind of like best director.” And with that, they started handing out awards.

In an interview with the Guardian published Sunday, Alwyn reflected on the couple’s more than six-year long relationship and whether or not he ever feared it would eclipse his career. “I have tried just to focus on controlling what I can control,” he said. “And, right from the beginning, I tried to focus on the things that are meaningful for me: friends, family, work, of course,” the actor continued. “So noise outside of that, I think I’ve done what lots of people who find themselves in the public eye do, which is just try and ignore it. If you don’t, and if you let all of that other stuff in, and if it starts to affect you and your behavior, you’re living from the outside in. And then you’re pretty f---ed.” The 33-year-old actor, who stars in one of the award circuit’s buzziest films of the year The Brutalist, went on to explain that he has “great family and friends and real things in my life” that keep him “tethered to the ground.” “So I don’t know how else to say it, it’s...just in a different room,” Alwyn continued. When asked by the outlet if he wants to move on from the public interest in his time with the pop star, Alwyn pressed back and said that he has—and the moving on is “something for other people to do” now. “We’re talking about something that’s a while ago now in my life,” he added. “So that’s for other people. That’s what I feel.” Alwyn and Swift were first linked in 2016 and were repeatedly photographed together in 2017, sparking rumors of a romance. It wasn’t until 2018 that Alwyn publicly addressed their relationship for the first time, telling British Vogue that he’s “aware people want to know about that side of things” but would rather keep things private and “talk about work.” While the pair worked together on Swift’s Folklore and Evermore albums and were at the epicenter of engagement rumors for years, by April 2023 it was confirmed that they had split. A source told People magazine at the time that Swift and Alwyn had “rough patches before and always worked things out, so friends thought they would take some time apart but eventually come back together” before adding, “ultimately, [they] weren’t the right fit for one another.”",1,[],2025-01-06 03:19:55,2025-01-06 20:06:01

Ahead of the anniversary of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, Biden was asked if he still thought Trump was a threat to democracy. ""We've got to get back to establishing basic democratic norms,"" Biden told reporters in the White House East Room on Sunday. ""I think what he did was a genuine threat to democracy. I'm hopeful that we are beyond that."" Biden made the comments to the press after signing the Social Security Fairness Act. Biden Admin Ripped After Judge Upholds Plea Deals For Alleged 9/11 Masterminds: ‘Kick In The Gut ""The bill I’m signing today is about a simple proposition. Americans who have worked hard all of their lives to earn an honest living should be able to retire with economic security and dignity,"" he said. ""That’s the entire purpose of the Social Security system crafted by Franklin Delano Roosevelt nearly 90 years ago."" Read On The Fox News App The president said that the signing ""is the culmination of a four-year fight."" ""As the first president in more than 20 years to expand social security benefits, this victory is the culmination of a four-year fight to provide security for workers who dedicate their lives to their communities, and I’m proud to have played a small part in this fight,"" Biden said. The bill ends a pair of provisions — the Windfall Elimination Provision created in 1983 and the Government Pension Offset devised in 1977 — that curtail the social security benefits of some U.S. retirees receiving retirement benefits from another source, such as a local government or state-funded pension. In the House, 327 members and 76 Senators voted to stand with around 3 million retired firefighters, police officers, teachers, and other public sector workers who also receive pension payments, Mick McHale, president of the National Association of Police Organizations, told Fox News Digital. ""For over 40 years, the men and women, especially in the area of public safety… have been penalized as a result of the pension system that they belong to,"" McHale said. Biden also discussed his plans to visit New Orleans on Monday to grieve with family members of victims and meet with officials after the terrorist attack in the city on New Year's Day. Did Biden Do Enough On Terror? ""I've been there. There's nothing you can really say to somebody who has had such a tragic loss. And my message is going to be personal to them,"" he said. ""They just have to hang on to each other and there will come a day when they think of their loved one, and they'll smile before a tear comes to their eye."" The visit comes after 14 people were killed and dozens injured after police said 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar rammed a rented pickup truck into pedestrians on bustling Bourbon Street early Wednesday morning. Police fatally shot Jabbar after he opened fire on officers. ""We established beyond any reasonable doubt that New Orleans was a single man who acted alone. All the talk about conspiracies with other people, no evidence of that, zero,"" Biden said. ""He had real problems in terms of his own, I think, mental health, going on. And he acted alone in the same way as what went on in Las Vegas,"" Biden said. ""But there is no evidence, zero evidence of the idea that these are foreigners coming across the border, but they worked here, they remained here.""

""This is Washington credentialism in a nutshell. Politicians become ‘qualified’ by simply existing. It doesn't matter that Biden is an abject failure and the worst foreign policy figure in American history. You see, he knows a lot of people, and that's all that matters,"" RedState writer Bonchie wrote. CNN conservative commentator Scott Jennings quipped, ""The most civil, decent, and devoutly Catholic president we’ve ever had."" Biden has lashed out at the press throughout his term, sometimes lobbing aggressive comments at the reporters themselves. In November, Biden mocked a reporter asking him whether he could broker a hostage deal between Hamas and Israel before leaving office.

Stars arrived at the awards show in bold suits and eye-catching gowns. Elle Fanning and Adam Brody wore some of the most memorable looks of the night. On Sunday, the 82nd annual Golden Globes kicked off at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in California. The biggest stars in television and film arrived on the red carpet ahead of the show, hosted by comedian Nikki Glaser. Hollywood legend Ted Danson was in attendance to accept the Carol Burnett Award, while Viola Davis was honored with the Cecil B. DeMille Award. They were just some of the stars wearing stunning ensembles. From dramatic ball gowns to daring suits, take a look at the best looks of the night. Miley Cyrus Cyrus arrived in a black, floor-length gown designed by Celine. It featured a halter neckline that plunged to her navel and was trimmed with silver beading, as were cutouts on the bodice. The neckline and cutouts formed a flower. The back of the dress was open, with strips of sparkly fabric connecting the gown. Zendaya Louis Vuitton designed Zendaya's orange gown. The form-fitting piece had a sweetheart neckline and hit Zendaya at the ankle. A train attached to Zendaya's waist flowed out behind her. She wore Bulgari jewelry. Sebastian Stan Instead of wearing a traditional suit, Stan's black jacket flowed to his calf and was trimmed with white, giving it a modern flair. His black pants ruched around his legs, and he wore black shoes. Nicole Kidman Kidman's silver dress had one shoulder strap and was backless, creating a design that was elegant in front and daring from behind. The custom Balenciaga piece was also covered in silver sparkles and had a train that glided as she walked. The actor completed her outfit with a ponytail. Dwayne Johnson The Rock posed in a shiny lilac top and a jacket in a slightly lighter shade of purple. He added a colorful brooch to his lapel and donned see-through sunglasses. Black pants and shoes completed the look. Sarah Paulson Instead of opting for a simple, little black dress, Paulson wore a dramatic gown decorated with feathers. The strapless piece had a short train, a fitted waist, and a sweetheart neckline. Paulson also wore vibrant blush and a statement choker necklace. Emma Stone Louis Vuitton custom-made Stone's red gown, which was strapless and puffed at the hips. The dress also had a satin belt that extended out on one side, and Stone debuted a short haircut. Cara Delevingne Delevingne chose a sparkly look for the night, wearing a high-neck, blue dress that was sleeveless. Gems trimmed the neckline, adding even more glamour to the look. Margaret Qualley Qualley's white dress had a square neckline, which was adorned with delicate beading. The dress cinched at her waist with a shiny black bow, and the skirt featured tiers of ruffles that almost seemed to hover around Qualley. Ariana Grande Grande's archival Givenchy Haute Couture gown first debuted in 1966, when Hubert de Givenchy's designs were heavily inspired by Audrey Hepburn. The yellow silk dress was hand-beaded on the empire waist bodice. The skirt flowed to her ankles and was slightly ruched. White gloves and Swarovski jewels completed the retro look. Colman Domingo Domingo played with patterns with his black and white Golden Globes look, which was designed by Valentino. His suit was black, and he paired it with a white top covered in black polka dots. He wore a scarf in place of a tie that formed a bow on his neckline, which featured both a checked pattern and stripes. Kate Winslet Winslet's single-breasted, white suit included a slightly oversize jacket and flared pants. Black sparkly flowers were embroidered into the jacket on the bodice and sleeve, adding dimension to the look. Viola Davis Davis' black gown featured a V-neckline and an A-line shape. The skirt flowed to the floor after being cinched at her waist. The gown was covered in delicate sparkly beading, which complemented the semi-sheer, multicolored cape attached to it. Zoe Saldaña Saldaña chose a brown Saint Laurent dress for the Golden Globes. The sparkly gown hugged her figure and curved into a plunge on the strapless neckline. She accessorized the look with a coordinating detached cape that functioned as a train. Kate Hudson Hudson's navy ball gown, designed by Carolina Herrera, had a strapless neckline and full skirt. The dress was covered in sparkly floral embellishments that glittered as she walked the red carpet. A coordinating choker necklace tied the look together. Alexandra Daddario Daddario mixed textures with her custom Vivienne Westwood dress. The asymmetrical neckline was covered in voluminous white feathers that spilled over the bodice, while the rest of the dress was made of sparkly black fabric. Eddie Redmayne Redmayne chose a black and cream-patterned suit for the Golden Globes. The slim-fit ensemble's jacket and pants featured a checked pattern. He paired the bold set with an off-white shirt with a popped-up collar. Black shoes grounded the look. Jessica Gunning Gunning, who is nominated for her performance in ""Baby Reindeer,"" arrived at the awards show in a velvet blue dress. A ruffled, voluminous layer of fabric covered the neckline of the dress, contrasting with the figure-hugging skirt. Mindy Kaling Kaling arrived in a sparkly gold gown from Ashi Studio. The form-fitting dress, which shimmered as Kaling walked the red carpet, had a strapless neckline and a slit on the side. Cristin Milioti Milioti, who was nominated for her performance in ""The Penguin,"" chose a simple black dress for the Golden Globes. The gown's neckline was trimmed with angular, sparkly fabric designed to look like leaves, giving it a chic pop. That same trim was attached to Milioti's black gloves. Elle Fanning Fanning's glamorous taupe gown from Balmain featured a full skirt, which cinched at the waist. The V-neck bodice brought a modern edge to the gown's classic shape, as the top was covered in leopard-print fabric. Cartier jewelry completed the look. Adam Brody Adam Brody put a fresh twist on menswear with his deep-green suit from Prada. The double-breasted jacket had black hardware, and he accessorized with a white flower on one of his black lapels. Black shoes completed the look. Zoë Kravitz The neckline of Kravitz's black gown plunged nearly to her navel, where a white ribbon cinched her waist. The bow flowed out behind her in place of a train. Saint Laurent designed the dress. Eiza González Gucci designed the shimmering gold dress Gonzalez chose for the Golden Globes. The figure-hugging dress was sleeveless and featured a high neckline, contrasting with the back, which was nearly entirely open aside from thin ties. Rachel Brosnahan Brosnahan's deep-green gown was covered in architectural detailing, from the ruching across the bodice that flowed into one sleeve to a thigh-high slit on the skirt that allowed the fabric to cascade around her leg. The dress also featured a subtle ombré, turning nearly blue at the bottom of the skirt. Leighton Meester Meester's sage-green dress featured a cowl neck that dipped low on her chest. She accessorized with a simple diamond necklace and bracelet. Read the original article on Business Insider",1,[],2025-01-06 03:19:55,2025-01-06 20:06:01

(KTLA) – An investigation is underway after a man was found fatally shot in the street in Van Nuys early Sunday morning, officials announced. Officers with the Los Angeles Police Department responded to the 16100 block of Leadwell Street, at Woodley Avenue, on reports of an assault with a deadly weapon at around 5:30 a.m. At the scene, officials said police found the victim, described only as “a male, age unknown,” suffering from a single gunshot wound. Medical personnel with the Los Angeles Fire Department arrived at the scene and rushed the victim to the hospital where, despite life-saving efforts, he succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced deceased. In video of the crime scene posted to the Citizen App, a portion of Leadwell Street could be seen cordoned off with yellow police tape while detectives presumably worked to gather evidence. Parked at the curb was at least one recreational vehicle with a dartboard attached to the front bumper that had its upper half covered by a heavily weathered tarp. On the sidewalk next to the RV, a ladder, a table and extension cords were strewn along the path. It’s unclear if the area was a homeless encampment or if the victim was possibly living in the RV. Authorities said that, so far, no arrests have been made in the fatal shooting, nor was any description of possible suspect or suspects released. The identity of the deceased male is being withheld pending notification of next of kin. Anyone with information about this investigation is asked to contact LAPD’s Operation Valley Bureau at 818-374-9550. Those wishing to remain anonymous can call the L.A.

Nassau County executive Bruce Blakeman seemingly relented and released a statement Sunday saying that he would allow flags to be lowered for just three days—a significantly shorter period of time than most other municipalities in New York State and across the country. The period in question, Jan. 7 to Jan. 9, also notably would not include Trump’s inauguration day. Last week, Trump pitched a fit on Truth Social over the fact that flags would likely be flying at half-staff across the country when he is set to be sworn into office on Jan. 20. The flags in Nassau County will be at half-staff for President Carter from the commencement of Lying in State on January 7th through burial on January 9th. pic.twitter.com/tkzs0IXF0X — Bruce Blakeman (@NassauExec) January 5, 2025 “The Democrats are all “giddy” about our magnificent American Flag potentially being at “half mast” during my Inauguration. They think it’s so great, and are so happy about it because, in actuality, they don’t love our Country, they only think about themselves,” Trump wrote to Truth Social on Friday. “In any event, because of the death of President Jimmy Carter, the Flag may, for the first time ever during an Inauguration of a future President, be at half mast. Nobody wants to see this, and no American can be happy about it.” Trump’s online supporters all agreed. “OUR FLAG SHOULD BE FLYING FULLY MAST FOR THE PEOPLES PRESIDENT’S INAUGURATION,” a Truth Social user commented on his post. “They Are Showing Us They Hate Us because WE CHOSE THE PRESIDENT AND WE Are Taking Back OUR POWER!” “Anything to disrupt President Trump’s Inauguration makes the Dems happy,” another user wrote. “I’m so sick of all of this.” Blakeman, once called a “mini-Trump” by New York’s Democratic Chair Jay Jacobs, has staunchly supported the billionaire over the years. He also spoke at a rally with Trump during the 2024 campaign and held an umbrella over the incoming president during a press conference earlier this year.

Seth Koslow, a Democratic county legislator, told CBS News New York that “politics shouldn’t play into” the decision whether to honor a former president. “This should be about what’s right for a person who represented our country, who guided our country and then served our country when they were done as president, and it’s the right thing to do,” he said. Under Blakeman’s post announcing the flag lowering, commenters remained split on the decision. “Show some respect and fly them at half staff for the 30 days that President Biden called for.

The discovery, which was announced by the University of Haifa on Dec. 30, was made during an excavation in the Jordan Valley. Coincidentally, archaeologists found the coins during Hanukkah. In a press release that was translated from Hebrew to English, the university explained that the artifacts date back to the Hellenistic period. ‘Santa Claus’ Sarcophagus And More Ancient Religious Relics Among Big Discoveries In 2024 The coins depict Alexander Jannaeus, who was king of Judaea from 103 B.C. to 76 B.C. Jannaeus, a Jewish leader of the Hasmonean dynasty, predated the destruction of the Second Temple, which was a major Jewish pilgrimage site and closely related to the story of Hanukkah. Read On The Fox News App Pictures released by the university show the coins, which have different shapes and sizes, still retaining faint symbols. The cache, which is believed to be the largest of its kind ever found in Israel, contains coins written in both Aramaic and Greek. Archaeologists Uncover One Of The World's Oldest Christian Churches Very few caches of coins minted under Alexander Jannaeus have been found by archaeologists, according to the University of Haifa. The university also said the coins were found in a ""road station,"" or a stop for travelers along the road leading to Alexandrion, an ancient fortress. They were discovered in a room that was likely used as a kitchen. ""The researchers are convinced that the site of the excavations in the Jordan Valley… is a road station that has not been known until now, on the main road that leads to the fortress of Sartaba (Alexandrion), which was built by King Yanai,"" the University of Haifa said in a Facebook post.

In a press release, archaeologist Dr. Shai Bar noted that the discovery was very meaningful to his excavation team amid the Israel-Hamas war. ""The students and the volunteer excavators in the excavation were very excited to find such an Hasmonean cache, and more during Hanukkah, and this added special significance to them… during the difficult days that pass on our people at the present time,"" Bar said.

If you purchase something from our posts, we may earn a small commission. Ever since I discovered infrared sauna blankets (which allow you to reap some of the benefits of saunas from the comfort of your couch, bed, floor, etc.), I’ve been touting them as my favorite wellness find of all time. Most at-home sauna blankets are basically like sleeping bags supercharged with infrared and controlled heat therapy, and I’ve officially waxed poetic about them ad nauseam. While I still regard sauna blankets as a sound and space-saving health investment for anyone looking to sweat with benefits, I have since graduated to the next level of at-home sauna tech: Heat Healer’s Energy Sauna, a compact (and actually aesthetically pleasing!) at-home sauna equipped with infrared, red light, and PEMF modalities in one sleek unit. Unlike sauna blankets, Heat Healer’s Energy Sauna is engineered with ‘triple threat’ technology, allowing users to reap the benefits of red light, PEMF (Pulsed Magnetic Energy), and infrared therapies all in one device. This larger investment piece is on par with the infrared sauna pods I’ve used at my local wellness studio, and that’s precisely how it was designed. “The Energy Sauna distinguishes itself through innovation with our triple threat tech, adding the combination of PEMF and Red LED to the already amazing Infrared Heat,” explains Heat Healer’s founder, Lauren Dovey. “These technologies, when used simultaneously, are amplified with the infrared heat relaxing you and penetrating your body. It also saves time instead of using separate devices for each technology.” As someone with little time for self-care, I appreciate the triple-pronged benefits of the Energy Sauna. Before diving into my review, here’s a brief explainer of the benefits of each of the three modalities the Energy Sauna harnesses. Traditional dry saunas (the kind you’ll usually find in spas and gyms) differ from infrared heat saunas in both the mechanism of heat and offering similar, though slightly different, benefits. “[Dry saunas] use heat from a furnace that heats up the air to heat up the body. Far-infrared saunas use the infrared wavelength (around 1440 nm-3000 nm) to heat up the body directly—not the air,” says Nilda Agnes Abellera, M.D., founder of Infuze MD. While both dry saunas and near infrared saunas are effective ways to heat the body and promote detoxification, pain relief, and post-workout recovery, she notes that far infrared saunas may be more tolerable for users than dry saunas. “Temperatures can go up to 150 degrees Fahrenheit in a far-infrared sauna and are much better tolerated than a traditional dry sauna,” she explains. ‘Father of Biohacking,’ Bulletproof founder and longevity expert Dave Asprey agrees, adding that infrared saunas are actually more effective in detoxifying toxins from the body than old-fashioned saunas. “Instead of heating you from the outside, infrared saunas heat up your body from the inside out. Infrared saunas are seven times more effective for detoxification than regular saunas,” he tells the Daily Beast. Aside from detoxification, some studies suggest regular far infrared sauna use may help improve cardiovascular health, reduce stress and anxiety, help with weight loss and maintenance, help fight chronic fatigue, and even extend your lifespan. The mat portion of the Energy Sauna is powered with PEMF technology, featuring four PEMF emitters that release bursts of magnetic energy designed to mimic the Earth’s natural magnetic field in the frequency range of 1Hz-30Hz. “PEMF works by penetrating deep into your body while stimulating the mitochondria in your cells. Your mitochondria are the powerhouse within your cells and are responsible for producing ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is the energy source your cells use to recover and repair,” explains Dovey. Aside from its energy-boosting effect, PEMF technology may help reduce pain and muscle stiffness by reducing inflammation in the body. These potential benefits, in conjunction with infrared heat therapy, make it a great post-workout recovery booster. I’ve noticed a significant improvement in stiffness and soreness post-workout when using Energy Healing following my exercise, and it also seems to help alleviate my menstrual cramps. Whether it be anti-aging face masks or adult night lights, red light therapy is having a major moment in the wellness space, but the technology is far from new. In fact, it’s been thoroughly studied since the ’90s when NASA researchers began looking at its cellular renewing benefits on its astronauts. “For decades, [light] has been researched by scientists who discovered that light in a narrow band of red and near-infrared can safely produce health benefits. The authors of thousands of published peer-reviewed papers believe that this band of light stimulates the mitochondria in your cells to create the energy we need,” Dr. Sarah de la Torre, Chief Medical Officer of Joylux, previously told the Daily Beast. When mitochondria are in an excited state, they release Adenosine Triphosphate and Nitric Oxide, which help fortify collagen, increase blood flow, and expedite tissue repair, which explains its laundry list of beauty and health benefits. “Light energy is now being used in various health applications—from wrinkle reduction, hair growth, and wound healing to a reduction of pain and inflammation, as well as an improvement in vaginal wellness and perineal recovery after childbirth,” Dr. de la Torre explained. While Heat Healer doesn’t recommend using the sauna with your head inside the domes, the full-body red light therapy is impressive—and you can easily control the intensity (or turn it off altogether) during your session. Of course, if you want to improve your skin tones, soften fine lines, or target sagging skin, you’ll have to wear your red light therapy face mask. Unboxing the Heat Healer Energy Sauna was slightly daunting; once the contents were revealed, the actual setup only took my husband and me about ten minutes. The sauna comes with two faux leather-lined domes, a PEMF mat, a removable, machine-washable cover that wicks away sweat, a head pillow, a Velcro curtain that attaches to the interior of the dome to trap heat, a digital control panel, and all the necessary cables to connect them complete with high-quality pewter connectors. The textures, visual design, and overall premium on quality were immediately apparent down to the study cables and super-responsive controls. I was immediately impressed by how well-made this thing is—especially for the price. The unit heats up super fast (within five to ten minutes) thanks to its unique dome shape and emissive nichrome heating panels. This is much faster than my infrared sauna blanket and the professional infrared sauna pod I used to use at the wellness studio. As with a professional infrared sauna, you do not put your face or head inside the dome, which helps prevent you from feeling overly hot, dizzy, or claustrophobic. Since starting to use this amazing at-home sauna, I have canceled my membership to the wellness studio I frequented for their infrared sauna sessions (which cost over $100 a month). The Energy Sauna gives me the same effect, sweat, and glow (plus PEMF therapy) with much more convenience. While I used a sample model provided by the brand for this review, this would likely pay for itself in a few months. If you’re someone who feels like you’re looking for the next best thing to an infrared sauna blanket or if you are paying for a membership to a gym or wellness facility, investing in the Heat Healer’s Energy Sauna is going to give you the same benefits and save you money in no time. While the Energy Sauna is much larger than the brand’s Sauna Blanket, it’s not an eyesore by any means. The brand did a great job in designing it using mutually nesting component pieces for the tube-like structure so that the pieces could be broken down and stored within one another at a fraction of their full setup size. Additionally, it comes with bags that are great for storage, safe travel, or preventing any spills or accidents (whether human or otherwise) befall your new precious wellness tool. It honestly even looks kind of chic once it’s disassembled and prepared for storage after use. Ideally, you’d be able to set this up once in a home gym or sauna area and leave it ready to use, but the beauty of this model is that even for those of us who lack the dedicated space to have a wellness or health room (or even multiple rooms at all), the Energy Sauna allows a premium at-home experience without taking up much of that premium floor space in your home. They have a five-year limited warranty and, even better, a lifetime trade-in policy. This means that if the brand launches a new model, you can trade your older version for the new one for 50 percent off the new model with the latest upgrades and improved features. If you’re concerned about radiation like I am, Heat Healer’s Energy Sauna is engineered with low to zero electromagnetic fields (EMF) radiation and “effectively zero” EMF levels at the default setting with PEMF therapy turned off. While you can use the Energy Sauna daily, Dovey recommends committing to 20 to 40-minute sessions at least three or four times a week to reap the most benefits. “I am on a mission to get our customers into the sauna 3-4 times a week. This frequency strikes the perfect balance, allowing users to feel the cumulative benefits of the sauna over both short and long term,” she says. In addition to consulting your physician before beginning any sauna routine, Dr. Abellera says it’s essential to stay hydrated and dry off after each session. “It’s important that you hop in the shower or towel off right after you exit the sauna so that any toxins you release don’t re-enter your skin.” All in all, Heat Healer’s Energy Sauna brings a trifecta of wellness technology to bear (red light, PEMF, and infrared heat therapies), offering you a unique suite of potential curative effects. With high-quality craftsmanship, a scientifically sound basis for the methods employed, and a sleek and convenient at-home design, the Energy Sauna may be just the perfect way for you to harness these studio-level tools with the flexibility of at-home use.",0,[],2025-01-06 03:19:55,2025-01-06 20:07:50

If you purchase something from our posts, we may earn a small commission. When I first heard that mouth tape was a thing, I thought it was an April Fool’s Day prank. How on earth could taping your mouth closed for eight hours not be insanely uncomfortable, harmful to your skin (ouch!), and make it borderline impossible to breathe? I was already skeptical, but some of its proposed benefits seemed downright far-fetched, including a more snatched jawline, improved sinus function, and reduced snoring. I wasn’t just doubtful; I was legitimately frightened by this emerging ‘wellness’ trend that had taken over my TikTok feed. Fast forward to two months later, and not only am I no longer horrified by taping my mouth (partially) closed every night before bed, but I’ve become a bona fide believer. While the research is scant and expert endorsements of the trending modality are mixed at best, many non-expert mouth tape loyalists say that the unconventional sleep hygiene habit has changed their lives for the better, including content creator, podcast host, and founder of my favorite skincare tool brand, Lauryn Bosstick of The Skinny Confidential, who called it “the best beauty tip ever,” and “like a ‘do not disturb’ for my mouth,” in a recent TikTok post. Unlike most lifestyle podcasters and small business owners, I trust this woman’s recommendations implicity. I mean, just look at her impeccably chiseled jawline. I was sold. The idea behind mouth tape is that it forces you to breathe from your nose instead of your mouth, which may help so-called ‘mouth breathers’ become ‘nasal breathers.’ Along with the aforementioned anecdotal aesthetic and wellness benefits of transforming from a mouth breather to a nasal breather, it could theoretically help alleviate bad breath, help with TMJ (temporomandibular joint) pain and dysfunction, and may even help relieve sleep apnea, according to neuroscientist and podcaster Andrew Huberman, Ph.D and corroborated by research published in recent medical journals. What I love about The Skinny Confidential Mouth Tape, which launched in April and initially sold out in just a couple of days, is that the pink, soft, and malleable tape features a small slit in the middle, so you’re I’m completely cut off from mouth breathing—and I can even still sip from my emotional support Stanley Quencher Tumbler with it on (yes, I’m officially a Basic Bitch™. As someone with a panic-prone anxiety disorder who needs to have water accessible at all times, this design feature was simply the only way I could get behind trying this new wellness trend. So, if you’re nervous about trying it, I would definitely opt for TSC’s mouth tape over other brands due to their consideration of these qualities and features. Thankfully, It’s also painless when you remove it from your lips in the morning—no ripping the bandage off sensation with this mouth tape. As with incorporating any new treatment, supplement, or wellness modality, there are potential side effects and risks, so you should always consult your healthcare provider or physician before trying mouth tape. If you do, however, get the OK from your doctor and, like me, are a little nervous about mouth taping, The Skinny Confidential’s mouth tape has you covered.",0,[],2025-01-06 03:19:55,2025-01-06 20:08:05

Included in the claims was the bombshell accusation that Bayless made a number of sexual advances and even “offered her $1.5 million to have sex” with him. In a statement to Front Office Sports, which first reported the lawsuit, Fox Sports stated: “We take these allegations seriously and have no further comment at this time given this pending litigation.” Representatives for Bayless, Fox Sports, and Faraji did not immediately respond to the Daily Beast’s request for comment. Faraji alleges in the suit that after starting work on Bayless’ Undisputed morning show, he would give her “lingering hugs after each haircut, putting his body against her own, pressing against her breast.” He then allegedly began to “kiss her on her cheeks.” She claimed that she would deny Bayless’ repeated advancements by saying that she didn’t date at work, or coming up with excuses to leave like needing to pick up her son from school. In July 2021 Faraji had a biopsy scheduled to determine if she had ovarian cancer. She then explained her situation to Bayless “hoping that he would take pity on her and cease his advances,” according to the lawsuit. Instead, the sports anchor allegedly “told her that he wanted to be with her” and made the million-dollar offer to her. Around a week after that incident, Bayless allegedly made another advance at Faraji where she told him: “Skip, stop, you have a wife.” Bayless then allegedly responded: “Aren’t you Muslim? Doesn’t your dad have three to four wives?” “Ms. Faraji responded that her father was dead, and when Mr. Bayless looked taken aback, she made an excuse to leave,” the suit continued. Elsewhere in the suit, Faraji alleges that network executive Charlie Dixon “placed his arm” on her lower back during a 2017 birthday party in West Hollywood and began “rubbing her body and grabbing her buttocks.” She also alleges that when she told Taylor about the incident, the on-air host allegedly told her to “get over it” and stated that she only had her job because of Dixon and that he could easily get rid of her. Faraji’s suit seeks class-action status on her behalf as well as other nonexempt Fox employees working in California over the past four years. She seeks unspecified monetary damages and a jury trial. “When Ms. Faraji and others came forward to report the wrongdoing, instead of addressing their concerns, Fox retaliated against them while the perpetrators and those who protected them were inexplicably promoted,” the lawsuit alleges. “This case thus represents yet another in a long line of cases chronicling the toxic culture at Fox, marked by bad faith promises and repeated failures to address a poisonous and entrenched patriarchy.”",2,[],2025-01-06 03:19:55,2025-01-06 20:07:28

The Tim Burton-directed film was released in 1990 and focuses on the life of an unfinished humanoid, Edward (Johnny Depp), whose scissor blades for hands make it difficult for him to assimilate into suburban life. Johnny Depp's Actress Daughter Is Concerned About Preserving Her 'Anonymity' ""I was traumatized by it,"" Depp told Harper's Bazaar.

The overturning of the Chevron doctrine in June limits federal agencies' power, complicating deregulation efforts. Deregulation delays could disappoint investors who have been pricing in less red tape since Trump's win. A recent Supreme Court decision could hinder one of the stock market's biggest reasons for rallying around Donald Trump's coming second term in office. Trump's election win in November excited Wall Street over the idea that a wave of deregulation was set to unleash gains for American businesses. However, the Supreme Court's June decision to overturn the so-called Chevron doctrine could hinder the Trump administration's deregulatory agenda, strategists at Carson Group said this week. The Chevron doctrine was a decadeslong legal precedent dating back to 1984 that empowered federal government agencies to interpret laws when legislation passed by Congress was ambiguous. The Supreme Court's precedent, set during the Ronald Reagan administration, was that courts should defer to the agencies rather than make their own judgment in such instances. However, since the precedent was overturned in June, courts are now dismissing federal agencies' interpretations of ambiguous laws. This was on full display earlier this week when the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down net neutrality rules. The three-judge panel specifically highlighted the downfall of the Chevron doctrine in their ruling. ""Unlike past challenges that the D.C. Circuit considered under Chevron, we no longer afford deference to the FCC's reading of the statute,"" the decision said. Barry Gilbert, investment strategist at Carson Group, said in a note on Friday that the Chevron doctrine was initially supported by conservative justices in 1984 ""because it made deregulation easier."" ""Overturning Chevron was great (from a Republican perspective) when Democrats are in power, but it also makes deregulation more difficult, which is why the original Chevron case went to the Supreme Court in the first place,"" Gilbert said. With Republicans set to hold a trifecta of power in the White House and both chambers of Congress later this month, the overturning of the Chevron doctrine could come back to bite them when it comes to enacting policies aimed at loosening regulations for the private sector, according to Gilbert. ""Some efforts to lighten regulatory requirements are likely to be met with waves of litigation that may take years to work their way through the court system,"" Gilbert said. What could have been swift deregulation policies enacted by President-elect Trump could now take much longer to play out as lawsuits inevitably make their way before the courts. ""We are worse off than the Reagan administration was before the Chevron ruling, because courts will be drawn into the messy process of delineating exactly what the new ruling means,"" Gilbert said. In a December note, UBS said that after the overturning of the Chevron doctrine, certain efforts to cut spending could also be impeded. ""The ruling also makes it harder to cut spending in areas that are well-defined in legislation,"" UBS said. UBS said that could impact the efforts of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, which seeks to significantly shrink the footprint of federal agencies. Eliminating entire agencies like the Department of Education would require 60 votes in the Senate. While deregulation is still on the table during Trump's second administration, it could ultimately happen much slower than during his first administration, which could set the stock market up for disappointment. ""It may make deregulation under the new Trump administration less robust than markets expect in places,"" Gilbert said.

Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Megan McMann said a citizen walking along the roadway, about four miles west of Oroville, spotted the body and called authorities about 9:12 a.m. McMann said while authorities believed the body belonged to Wesley Cornett, 17, DNA analysis would be conducted to confirm his identity.

Neither was wearing a life jacket. Dispatchers urged Cornett not to go into the water in the moments before the duo disappeared. Nearly 300 people from county search-and-rescue teams, state agencies and private firms joined the search for the Cornett brothers.

""I’m not at all sure that the election turned on any one or even a collection of foreign-policy issues. Most elections don’t. But leaving that aside: Americans don’t want us in conflict. They don’t want us in war. We went through 20 years where we had hundreds of thousands of Americans deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. People were tired of that, understandably. Well, when President Biden was vice president, he presided over the end of our engagement in Iraq. As president, he ended the longest war in our history, Afghanistan,"" he said, responding to a question about the election. The New York Times spoke to Blinken ahead of his exit from the White House and said that Americans were skeptical of Biden's foreign policy early on due to the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, which left more than a dozen American service members dead and led to the Taliban retaking control. The interviewer asked how the Afghanistan ""failure"" damaged America's credibility. Biden White House Accepts Responsibility For ‘Chaos’ In Afghanistan, Says It Is ‘Vigilant’ On Terror Threat ""First, I make no apologies for ending America’s longest war. This, I think, is a signal achievement of the president’s. The fact that we will not have another generation of Americans fighting and dying in Afghanistan, that’s an important achievement in and of itself,"" Blinken responded. The Times pushed back, noting that the Taliban has made it much harder for women in the country. Read On The Fox News App The interviewer said, ""In every possible way, the manner in which this was done and the state in which Afghanistan has been left could not have been what the United States desired."" ""There was never going to be an easy way to extricate ourselves from 20 years of war. I think the question was what we were going to do moving forward from the withdrawal. We also had to learn lessons from Afghanistan itself,"" Blinken added. The Biden administration was hit with pushback after the chaotic withdrawal. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan even reportedly offered to resign over the decision, according to The Washington Post's David Ignatius. Click Here For More Coverage Of Media And Culture Sullivan also reportedly had concerns about the exit, but ultimately said it would have been challenging no matter what they did. ""You cannot end a war like Afghanistan, where you’ve built up dependencies and pathologies, without the end being complex and challenging,"" Sullivan told the Post columnist. ""The choice was: Leave, and it would not be easy, or stay forever."" He added that ""leaving Kabul freed the [United States] to deal with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in ways that might have been impossible if we had stayed."" Ignatius reported that the Afghanistan withdrawal ""broke the early comity"" of the Biden administration's national security team, and created a riff between Sullivan and Blinken.

A lack of supply and an uptick in in-person neighborhood shopping has increased their value. One commercial real estate investor called the opportunity a ""retail renaissance."" Strip malls, of all things, appear to be trending up. After decades of decline brought on by the rise of large box stores, e-commerce, and the pandemic, the humble and sometimes derided neighborhood shopping center had long been on the outs. Many retailers shifted focus, buying and building large fulfillment warehouses instead of storefronts. That's led to a perhaps surprising shift, according to The Wall Street Journal: There is now a dearth of supply of convenient neighborhood shopping centers, and that is driving up the value of existing ones. Large investors like Blackstone have noticed and are now betting on the lowly strip mall. Blackstone spent $4 billion in November to acquire Retail Opportunity Investments, which owns about 90 shopping centers, most of them anchored by grocery stores. Blackstone President Jon Gray said at the time that he believes the extreme distress the commercial real estate market has faced in recent years is beginning to ease up. He now sees opportunity in the sector. ""If you were an investor in real estate after the financial crisis, you would have made a lot of money. And my guess is, if you're an investor today, the same thing will happen,"" he said at an event hosted by Goldman Sachs. Beyond just the value driven by scarcity, an uptick in in-person shopping also bodes well for the shopping center. Foot traffic to grocery stores was 12% higher in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same time in 2019, before the pandemic, the Journal reported. And there are many small businesses that still attract IRL shoppers, like coffee shops and nail salons. Flexible work schedules are also allowing residents to take quick shopping trips nearby. James Corl, head of New York-based private real estate group Cohen & Steers, wrote in a September blog post that the investment market for open-air shopping centers amounted to a ""retail renaissance."" Corl's firm bought a fully leased outdoor shopping mall in San Mateo, California for $127 million last month. ""Open-air shopping centers are the only major property type that is experiencing an acceleration in rental rate growth,"" Corl said in the blog post. ""We believe that a durable acceleration in earnings growth combined with relatively high current yields will propel shopping center investment performance for some time, a reality that the market has yet to fully recognize.""

Matthew Livelsberger’s ex-girlfriend, former army nurse Alicia Arritt, has revealed that he had telltale signs of post-traumatic stress disorder before he blew up a rented Cybertruck on Wednesday, killing himself in the process. “He described all the same symptoms as a textbook,” Arritt, 39, said to KKTV. “In 2020, he was having paranoia and nightmares. He was exhausted and depressed. He was gaining weight and he couldn’t think.” She claimed that highly-decorated soldier was plagued by trouble sleeping, pain, concussions and memory loss due to the military service that he wasn’t ready to give up. CNN reported that he had recently sought treatment from the Army for depression. But the stigma that surrounds mental health in active-duty military members may have led to his downfall. “If he got flagged for having depression or having a [traumatic brain injury], he would’ve been made non-deployable and he absolutely did not want that. He wanted to be there for his guys,” said Arritt, who parted ways with Livelsberger, 37, in 2021. The two had met on a dating app, and bonded over the outdoors and time in the military. “I first met him after a recent deployment to Afghanistan and he was struggling with some concussions and blast injuries he had. He was just exhausted from the back to back tours,” Arritt told the outlet. Even though Livelsberger and Arritt lost contact for nearly two years, he messaged her the day before his apparent suicide, sending videos of the Cybertruck. In surveillance footage surrounding the hotel’s entrance, the Tesla was covered in flames after detonating. “The VA has gotten so much better about caring for these veterans, but active duty, they don’t treat them,” Arritt said. “They just keep them in the war until they’re used up and then the VA takes care of them after they’re out.” He received a Bronze Star five times, with a highly-regarded military career. He left messages that said he needed to cleanse his mind after killing people and seeing fellow soldiers die. He had an arm tattoo, with bullets going through two skulls, embodying the lives he ended in Afghanistan, according to the Associated Press. “I don’t know what drove him to do this, but I think the military didn’t get him help when he needed it,” she told the AP. “There was no weakness allowed and mental health is weakness is what they saw.” f you or a loved one are struggling with suicidal thoughts, please reach out to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline by dialing or texting 988.",0,[],2025-01-06 03:19:55,2025-01-06 20:08:59

The veteran offensive lineman was active, and will likely start at his usual left tackle spot, opening the door for rookie Patrick Paul to make his first start of the season at right tackle. Paul has started two games previously for Armstead because of the concussion he suffered in the first month of the season, and the knee injury that forced the five-time Pro Bowler to sit out all but two series of the Dolphins’ overtime win over the New York Jets. Armstead, who is concluding his 12th NFL season, has been battling injuries his entire Dolphins career, and that includes his struggles with his troublesome knees, which he’s had operated on multiple times. While he hasn’t committed to playing next season, according to Mike McDaniel the Dolphins would welcome the team captain back with open arms if he wants to continue playing. Armstead is slated to make $14.3 million next season, but will likely be asked to restructure his contract, much like he did before this season, dropping his salary into the $10 million range. “There are conversations that he has to have with his family and whatever, but what a huge piece of our team he is. Just in terms of where we started off and where our mindset is in tough times or in good times. He’s one of the guys that everyone looks to,” McDaniel said. “You’re always hopeful for that.

Rev. Jonathan Hall has been trying to figure out ""what’s ‘too political’ for a place of worship — or whether ‘being political’ is the whole point of the Gospel,"" according to a report by The Washington Post. Hall’s First Christian Church of North Hollywood, a ""politically-blended congregation,"" struggled with political differences before and after the presidential election, when President-elect Donald Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in a landslide victory. Hall, a native of Alabama, led the church north of Los Angeles for two years. He aims to unite the church, but it’s been a challenge. ""Persuading the Republicans, Democrats and independents in his pews to stay and pray with one another is getting more complicated,"" the Post reported. Christians Increasingly Persecuted Worldwide As 'Modern And Historical Factors Converge' Read On The Fox News App The Post reported further, ""When he preaches what the Bible says about the mandate to care for migrants, Hall focuses on the story of Mary and Joseph rather than modern-day wanderers. He selected a book of scripture readings that sets out specific text for every Sunday, so no one could question whether his picks were making a political statement."" ""And when somebody tells him they think a sermon was aimed at a specific politician, he says, ‘That’s one way to look at it!’"" Los Angeles has typically been a liberal city for several decades. The city has not voted for a Republican mayor since 1993. Data from the presidential election in November shows that Los Angeles residents voted for Trump more than what many polls had projected. Trump won more votes in L.A. than he did in 2020, receiving approximately 40% of votes compared to 34%. Furthermore, Trump improved his vote share across the country, starting with conservative areas but extending into deeply Democratic states. Faith A Strong Force In Jimmy Carter's Life, Say Leaders: 'Heart Of A Servant' Several congregants left the church due to their political differences. One of the members cited a film Hall planned to screen about Christian nationalism being ""too one-sided"" and ""anti-Republican."" Others left after they discovered their peers were attending Trump’s inauguration. ""Someone else walked out of services early on the Sunday after the election, feeling that a leader on the stage was too focused on consoling people who voted for Vice President Kamala Harris,"" the Post added. ""If you’re at a football game, one side wins, and everyone leaves. With a church [and the election], it’s like everyone is still there,"" Hall said. He went on to say, ""The popcorn is still on the ground, the Coke cups, the mess. Fifty percent of people are upset, and we have to pick up the pieces."" First Christian is part of the Disciples of Christ denomination and serves over 1,000 members. The denomination’s origin was founded to ""unify Christian groups who had broken over theology and worship styles."" ""If I’m a good pastor, I’m both comforting you and confronting you. But I also need to be a prophet, right? You’re supposed to come to church to look for questions that will change your life."" ""Before Hall, the same pastor had led First Christian for 52 years. Congregants say the late Rev. Robert M. Bock didn’t speak about contemporary political issues in church — even during the Vietnam War, which marked the start of his tenure.

President of 9/11 Justice Brett Eagleson reacted to the news during ""Fox & Friends Weekend,"" calling the situation a ""horrific travesty"" as families remain outraged over the fact the death penalty could be removed as punishment for the suspected perpetrators. Judge Restores Controversial 9/11 Terrorist Plea Deals Involving Khalid Sheikh Mohammed: Report Brett Eagleson: It was a politically motivated decision to rescind it. We think that they knew all along that there was no way to do it, but in the heat of the election, in the lead up to November, they were utterly called out on the carpet for a horrific decision. Look, I haven't heard from a single 9/11 family member that thinks this is a good idea, and the reality here is that everything about 9/11, everything about this 23-year national nightmare that we've had to contend with, has been a horrific travesty from the days after 9/11. When the U.S. government worked with Saudi Arabia to cover up the Saudi Arabian role, to the time we sent 5,000 or 6,000 of our troops to be slaughtered in Iraq for no reason, to the very fact that Congress just denied the benefits for the first responders, now this… where we're getting these terrorist sweetheart cupcake deals. We've been kicked in the gut time and time again, and we're sick of it, and we are so hopeful that we finally have a president who's going to do the right thing here… One thing I want to point out is that on 9/11 this year, when VP Harris and Biden sat behind the red rope at the 9/11 World Trade Center Memorial, President Trump was… in a New York City firehouse. He was there with me, and I got a chance to talk to him. And we said to him, ‘Mr. President, you were right in 2016 when you said it was Saudi Arabia that knocked down those towers.’ He said it on this very show on ‘Fox and Friends.’ We said, Mr. President, we had to get the information not from the U.S. government, about Saudi Arabia's role, we had to get it from the British government. We said, ‘Mr. President, the same people who tried to take you down in Russia, Russia, Russia, Bob Mueller and the deep state of this country are the same people who have blocked justice for us. They’re the same people that came up with these horrible plea deals, would you do something to help us?' And he committed to us that day in a New York City firehouse on 9/11 that if he were elected president, he was going to do the right thing. He said he could deal with Saudi Arabia, and he was going to bring us final justice and closure, and we're going to hold them to account on that. And we're very hopeful. This is a new start for America. We have a Republican-controlled Congress, we have a president in the office who puts America first. So, let's hope that he really, truly does that. Read On The Fox News App Loved Ones Of 9/11 Victims React To Terror Defendant Plea Deal: 'Lifetime Of Pain And Suffering' Eagleson, who is the son of a 9/11 victim, was outraged by the decision, like many other family members, and is asking for more to be done. The plea deals would allow the three men accused of plotting the 9/11 attacks to plead guilty in exchange for being spared the death penalty. The court opinion, which has not been formally published yet, said the plea deals reached by military prosecutors and defense attorneys were valid and enforceable, and that Austin exceeded his authority when he later tried to nullify them. The Pentagon has the option of going next to the D.C. Circuit federal appeals court for emergency review, but the court docket did not show any filings as of Tuesday afternoon. A hearing is scheduled next week at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where Mohammad and two other defendants could plead guilty in separate hearings, with the death penalty removed as a possible punishment.

https://news.yahoo.com/news/60-000-judgment-against-florida-194818623.html,"A $60,000 judgment against a Florida mover often accused of fraud and extortion",,US,Miami Herald,5 min read,"This is the same mover who a Miami-Dade judge called an extortionist who participated in an “unfair, deceptive and fraudulent” scheme.",David J. Neal,2025-01-05T19:48:18.000Z,"No state agency has charged former Broward mover Shawn Thompson criminally, although at least two have been investigating Thompson after customer complaints alleging fraud and extortion. But, an Orange County court hit Thompson with a civil judgment in December just as a Miami-Dade court did a year earlier. A final judgment from Orange County Judge Jeramy C. Beasley on Dec. 4 hits Thompson with $13,000 in basic damages, $39,000 in punitive damages and $430 in court costs — plus it awarded $7,720 in attorney’s fees to plaintiff Scott Meyer. Backed by an estimate, invoices and Zelle transfer screenshots, Meyer’s lawsuit said Thompson’s Moving Giants gave Meyer an estimate of $669.50 for a 19-mile Orlando to Oveido move on July 11, 2023, then morphed it to $1,801 upon arrival at the Oveido location via unapproved new charges. The new invoice said Thompson and Thompson employee Renee Carter would hold Meyer’s property until he paid the inflated price. Beasley’s judgment was a default judgment. Unlike the Miami-Dade case, in which Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Michael Barket said Thompson’s testimony showed him to be “a direct participant in this unfair, deceptive, and fraudulent scheme,” Thompson wasn’t deposed. He didn’t respond to the Orange County lawsuit in any way, court records show. The process server appointed by Broward Sheriff’s Office said in court documents that Thompson even gave the false name of “Sam Smith” when being served at 6742 NW 17th Ave., the address of several of Thompson’s companies at the time. However, the process server ran the license tags in the parking lot and found the dark Mercedes SUV with Florida tag 42D MHC was registered to “Shawn Eyon David Thompson.” A driver’s license photo lookup confirmed the 5-11, 250-pound “Sam Smith” was Thompson. When a Herald reporter asked about this judgment Wednesday via text message, Thompson replied with three texts that accused the Herald of violating his civil rights by contacting him and putting the number he uses for Thompson Nation & Affiliates in an article. “This is your final warning,” Thompson wrote. “I am not like all these bull ---- stories you write just to try to get a name for yourself without facts and these people you write fall stories about is reaching out to me to file a suit against you for lies. All your stories have no merit or truth to it. Write one more lies about me and I’ll see you in court.” A Jacksonville resident who said a Thompson company pulled a sudden cost increase extortion on him during a move from Fort Lauderdale forwarded the Herald an Oct. 16, 2023 email he received from Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services’ Chief of Mediation and Enforcement W. Alan Parkinson that said: “...we’ve received 98 complaints since the beginning of 2022 against Thompson Nation Holdings LLC. We have referred a case to our Investigative Section for review based upon the complaints we’ve received.” FDACS has yet to act against Thompson, but Miami-Dade online court records say the state agency’s general counsel office requested certified copies of the Miami-Dade case’s final judgment; the permanent injunction against Thompson, Thompson Nation Holdings and Small Move Movers that says, in short, any repeat of the fraudulent behavior will be considered contempt of court; and the deposition of Nicollette Gonzalez. Gonzalez filed the Miami-Dade suit after she didn’t pay $3,243 of extra charges for a Miami-to-Gainesville move and Thompson hid her furniture and clothes. The judgment awarded her $7,619 plus attorney’s fees. Meyer and Gonzalez’s lawsuits describe a bait-and-extort scheme described on a Reddit page devoted to Thompson; described on Better Business Bureau pages of Thompson-connected moving businesses such as Fresh Start Moving & Storage, One Man, One Van and others; on other mover review sites; and Charlene, 61, and Leroy Clayborne, 75, a married couple who moved from Palm Coast to Aiken, South Carolina. Charlene Clayborne wrote in a Sept. 12 letter they used Green Go Movers, one of the Thompson-related companies now based out of the 2814 Silver Star Rd. Orlando office used by Thompson Nation Holdings, Thompson Nation & Affiliates and other Thompson companies. A Sept. 12 letter to Miami-Dade Judge Michael Barket, the last entry on the Gonzalez online case docket, says a quote of $5,000 turned into a final invoice of $20,131 after the Clayborne’s house was packed. Then, according to Charlene Clayborne, Green Go demanded $14,000 before they would roll off the property. They accepted a “good faith” payment of $1,500, part of which was a $1,000 Zelle payment to Shawn Thompson at travel.payprelo©gmail.com that Wells Fargo flagged as fraudulent. Clayborne wrote, “I explained that WF flagged the transaction as being fraudulent and [Alexis] stated that was because it was a new account.” “Alexis” also told Clayborne, the customer said, that $6,131 in cash would be due on arrival or the possessions wouldn’t be unpacked. Clayborne said a “Bobby” called from Green Go the morning the truck arrived in Aiken, claiming they now owed $8,434. Clayborne said after the movers arrived, she told them she was going to the bank for money orders. “Damian was upset by this as he was expecting cash. l told him to contact the office,” Clayborne wrote. “I left my house, parked at the top of the hill and called the sheriff’s office. They arrived approximately 20 minutes later. After reviewing our contract and proof of payment, the movers were ordered to give us our belongings or be arrested for larceny and their trucks be impounded. “l should mention that the movers arrived with a U-Haul truck and a Penske truck and only two people, one driver each. They literally tossed our things in the garage and then the driveway causing lots of damage. We took a video of them unpacking the trucks.” A search of the U.S. Department of Transportation site doesn’t turn up Green Go Movers as a licensed interstate mover. USDOT No. 4176294, which is associated with Green Go Moving on another site, comes up as Thompson company Today’s Move Movers, which does business as Two Men One Truck Movers, ph. no. 863-231-4582.

The FBI is investigating the attack as terrorism after police found an ISIS flag in the truck. The FBI also said the man stopped a multiple gun stores in Texas the day before the attack. The Army veteran who attacked a crowd in New Orleans on New Year's Day wore Meta smart glasses to record the area in advance, the FBI said at a press conference on Sunday. Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old US citizen from Texas, died in a shootout with police after driving a pickup truck through a crowd of people on Bourbon Street. Jabbar killed 14 people and injured dozens more in the attack. The FBI is investigating the attack as an act of terrorism after authorities found an ISIS flag, weapons, and a possible improvised explosive device, or IED, in the Ford F-150 pickup truck that Jabbar used. FBI New Orleans Special Agent in Charge Lyonel Myrthil said Sunday that Jabbar made two trips to New Orleans before the attack — once in October and once in November. In October, Myrthil said Jabbar stayed in a rental home in New Orleans for two days, where he used his Meta smart glasses to record the streets of the French Quarter as he rode around on a bicycle. ""Meta glasses appear to look like regular glasses, but they allow the user to record videos and photos hands-free,"" Myrthil told reporters. ""They also allow users to potentially livestream their video."" Jabar was wearing the Meta glasses during the attack, but he did not livestream it, Myrthil said. Myrthil also said during the press conference that Jabbar stopped at ""multiple gun stores"" in Texas on December 31 and visited one business where he purchased a white ice chest that he used to hide an explosive device. US military spokespersons told the media after the attack that Jabbar served in the Army from 2007 to 2015, during which he was deployed to Afghanistan from February 2009 to January 2010. He served in information technology and human resources roles at the time and was later an IT specialist in the Army Reserve from 2016 to 2020. He left the military as a staff sergeant.

Outside of Miami’s realistic chances of advancing to the playoffs if the Dolphins (8-8) beat the Jets, and Kansas City Chiefs beat the Denver Broncos on the road despite sitting most of the Chiefs’ key starters, Campbell was in position to earn an extra $300,000 this season if he’s able to produce his fifth sack of the season on Sunday. Campbell, who has contributed 49 tackles, four sacks, five pass deflections, and forced one fumble this season, earned that $300,000 when he took down Aaron Rodgers on a third down play in the third quarter. If he had recorded a sixth sack he would have gotten an extra $100,000 based on the incentives placed in his contract. The 17-year veteran, who signed a one-year deal worth $2 million last offseason, was already in line to earn an extra $725,000 from this season because he’s played more than 55 percent of Miami’s defensive snaps (58 percent coming into Sunday’s game), and the Dolphins are on pace to finish the season as a top 20 defense in points allowed, which was a trigger for the bonus. The Dolphins enter the Jets game tied for eighth in the NFL in points allowed (20.8) this season.

But for many retirees, that’s the reality. Not to be a downer at this fresh start time of year, but it’s useful to hear retirees’ regrets — especially if you’re closing in on retirement yourself. “Despite improvements in savings habits and financial engagement, many retirees regret some of the decisions they made earlier in life when preparing for retirement,” Suzanne Ricklin, vice president of retirement solutions at Nationwide Financial, told Yahoo Finance. “More than 8 in 10 workers over 45 regret not taking retirement saving more seriously when they were younger.” Here are five of retirees’ biggest regrets: Fewer than 1 in 4 retirees are very confident they will be able to maintain a comfortable lifestyle throughout their retirement, according to a new report by the nonprofit Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. The estimated median household savings among retirees, excluding home equity, in this survey is only $71,000. The estimated median home equity among retirees is $114,000. But 1 in 4 retirees do not have any home equity. More than two-thirds of retirees wish they would have saved more and on a consistent basis — and half wish they hadn’t waited so long “to concern themselves with saving and investing for retirement,” according to the researchers. “Many of today’s retirees lacked the awareness, know-how, and access to resources needed to successfully prepare themselves for retirement,” Catherine Collinson, CEO and president of Transamerica Institute, told Yahoo Finance. “Their careers began 40 or 50 or more years ago — which was long before the advent of 401(k)s and the societal imperative for people to self-fund a larger portion of their retirement income,” she said. For many women, the shortfall stems from a late start. Research from Corebridge Financial found that more than 6 in 10 retired women wish they had started saving for retirement earlier – only about a quarter of them began saving and investing between the ages of 18 and 29. Worse yet, about 4 in 10 retired women say they did not begin prioritizing their financial and retirement planning until 41 or later, and 20% said they still have not started. What?! “All this points to the importance of saving early in your working years,” Terri Fiedler, Corebridge Financial president of retirement services, told Yahoo Finance. “This came through loud and clear in our survey. Knowing what they know now, this was the No. 1 piece of advice retired women would give their younger selves about retirement planning.” One of the biggest gaffes people make when it comes to Social Security is claiming too early at a much lower benefit. You can improve your odds of not outliving your savings by delaying taking Social Security benefits, which will increase your monthly check considerably for decades. But many people don’t — or can’t — wait. The median age at which retirees started receiving benefits is 63, according to the Transamerica report. Nearly 3 in 10 retirees started receiving benefits at age 62, which is the earliest age possible, resulting in a much-reduced benefit. Only a slim fraction, 4%, of retirees waited until age 70. Here’s how the math works. If you have the flexibility to delay benefits, the increase that you get by waiting is substantial. Pushing back tapping your benefits from your full retirement age, or FRA — either 66 or 67 — until age 70, you earn delayed retirement credits. Those come to roughly an 8% per year annual increase in your benefit for each year until you hit 70, when the credits stop accruing. While there are clearly good personal reasons for claiming early, such as poor health or financial constraints, the psychological tug is often what pushes retirees to get their checks rolling earlier rather than later. Perhaps the biggest factor is the psychological ownership of one’s Social Security benefits, according to Suzanne Shu, a professor of marketing at Cornell University. Nearly half of retirees said that debt was a stumbling block that prevented them from saving for retirement, according to the Transamerica report. And once they retired, almost 7 in 10 reported carrying outstanding credit card debt, per a survey from the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI). That’s up from 4 in 10 four years ago. And one-third said their spending is much higher than they can afford in 2024, nearly double the respondents from 2020. Sometimes the decision to retire is a regret. About one-third of retirees regretted not working longer, according to Olivia Mitchell, co-author of a paper published in the National Bureau of Economic Research. The financial upside of working past the traditional retirement age is clear: more years of earning and saving, not needing to dip into retirement savings so those funds can stay invested and grow, and having the ability to push back claiming Social Security. Sometimes the choice, however, is made for you. More than half of those surveyed by EBRI retired earlier than expected due to reasons beyond their control, such as health problems or disability, or changes at their company, like downsizing, closure, or reorganization. Almost 6 in 10 retirees retired sooner than planned, per Transamerica. Only 1 in 5 retired early because they were financially able. Retirees typically regret not preparing emotionally and having a plan for the transition to retirement and what’s next, Preston Cherry, a certified financial planner, told Yahoo Finance. “These are having answers to questions such as: What am I going to do next? How am I going to do it? How am I going to reacclimate myself into hobbies and know myself?” he said. “They regret that it took them so long to give themselves permission to retire, and then to unplug from an identity that they may be used to — whether it be their business or corporate job.” In general, retirees are happy, have close relationships with family and friends, are enjoying life, have a positive view of aging, have a strong sense of purpose, and have an active social life. In fact, more than 4 in 10 retirees have experienced improvements to their enjoyment of life and happiness since they stepped out of the workforce, Transamerica data found. In addition, many are actually spending more time with family and friends and pursuing hobbies than they had expected would be possible. Over half of retired women rate their financial health as good or very good, compared to just 38% of those not retired, according to Corebridge’s research. “One thing that stood out in the data is the fact that retired women are more likely to describe their financial health positively than those still in their working years,” Fielder said. “It’s surprising that many women who have retired from the workforce seem to feel more secure about their finances than women who are still earning a paycheck.” The runway ahead is different for all of us, so how to create a life without regrets is not a cookie-cutter endeavor. “Retirement is highly personal,” Collinson said. “People retire at different ages and for different reasons.” Have a question about retirement? Personal finances? Anything career-related? Click here to drop Kerry Hannon a note. How about this for an intention for 2025: “Retirees with financial regrets should create a written financial plan,” Collinson said. Factor in living expenses, debt repayment, savings, and investments. Then look at how your asset allocation is divided between bonds, cash, and stocks so that it’s balanced for your risk tolerance, age, and goals. Review sources of guaranteed retirement income, healthcare needs, insurance protections, taxes, and the possible need for long-term care. And don’t forget inflation.""Many retirees were caught off guard these past few years,"" she said. ""Hopefully, inflation is back under control, but it will always pose a potential risk to retirees and their buying power.” Only 19% of retirees have a written plan, she added. “But just because you’re already retired doesn’t mean you can’t do some retirement planning to know where you stand and give yourself a boost.” Kerry Hannon is a Senior Columnist at Yahoo Finance.

A lack of supply and an uptick in in-person neighborhood shopping has increased their value. One commercial real estate investor called the opportunity a ""retail renaissance."" Strip malls, of all things, appear to be trending up. After decades of decline brought on by the rise of large box stores, e-commerce, and the pandemic, the humble and sometimes derided neighborhood shopping center had long been on the outs. Many retailers shifted focus, buying and building large fulfillment warehouses instead of storefronts. That's led to a perhaps surprising shift, according to The Wall Street Journal: There is now a dearth of supply of convenient neighborhood shopping centers, and that is driving up the value of existing ones. Large investors like Blackstone have noticed and are now betting on the lowly strip mall. Blackstone spent $4 billion in November to acquire Retail Opportunity Investments, which owns about 90 shopping centers, most of them anchored by grocery stores. Blackstone President Jon Gray said at the time that he believes the extreme distress the commercial real estate market has faced in recent years is beginning to ease up. He now sees opportunity in the sector. ""If you were an investor in real estate after the financial crisis, you would have made a lot of money. And my guess is, if you're an investor today, the same thing will happen,"" he said at an event hosted by Goldman Sachs. Beyond just the value driven by scarcity, an uptick in in-person shopping also bodes well for the shopping center. Foot traffic to grocery stores was 12% higher in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same time in 2019, before the pandemic, the Journal reported. And there are many small businesses that still attract IRL shoppers, like coffee shops and nail salons. Flexible work schedules are also allowing residents to take quick shopping trips nearby. James Corl, head of New York-based private real estate group Cohen & Steers, wrote in a September blog post that the investment market for open-air shopping centers amounted to a ""retail renaissance."" Corl's firm bought a fully leased outdoor shopping mall in San Mateo, California for $127 million last month. ""Open-air shopping centers are the only major property type that is experiencing an acceleration in rental rate growth,"" Corl said in the blog post. ""We believe that a durable acceleration in earnings growth combined with relatively high current yields will propel shopping center investment performance for some time, a reality that the market has yet to fully recognize.""

New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority said that the zone opened at 12:00:01 a.m. on Sunday morning and “is fully operational.” The scheme aims to ease New York’s infamous traffic problems and raise money for public transportation. It comes into effect despite an eleventh-hour effort from neighboring New Jersey and local opposition including from President-elect Donald Trump. Under the pricing plan, most cars entering  Manhattan’s central  business district — which stretches from 60th Street all the way down to the southern tip of the Financial District — must pay a peak fee of $9 from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays and 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekends. Off-peak would be a 75% discount — $2.25. Small trucks and noncommuter buses will pay $14.40 to enter Manhattan at peak times, while larger trucks and tourist buses will pay a $21.60 fee. Motorists will only be charged once a day, and exemptions include certain emergency and government vehicles, as well as low-income drivers and those who have medical conditions that prevent them from using mass transit. School and commuter buses are also exempt. The MTA has predicted there would be 10% fewer cars and trucks after the toll begins. MTA executives have also promised that billions of dollars raised by congestion pricing will pay to modernize the system all across the region. The program was reinstated after Gov. Kathy Hochul pushed to revive it after two years of delays and revisions amid complaints from commuters and businesses who don’t think the fare is fair. But the real race was to get the pricing approved before Trump takes office in January. Trump, a native New Yorker, has vowed to scrap the plan when he returns to the White House, and Republicans have already urged him to intervene. The charges also began as scheduled despite a last-ditch attempt by New Jersey to block the plan on environmental grounds. The lawsuit from New Jersey, seeking tens of millions of dollars, predicted environmental harm if traffic gets worse on the other side of the river. While the judge ruled that the Federal Highway Administration will need to weigh in, the MTA told NBC New York last week that it had the green light to proceed with the start of congestion pricing. In response to New Jersey’s lawsuit, Hochul has said she offered money to settle it — but no deal was reached. “We’ve made multiple offers to settle this lawsuit, very generous offers,” Hochul said previously. New York may be the first American city to adopt congestion pricing, but similar schemes have long been in place in cities like London and Stockholm. This story first appeared on NBCNews.com.

Ryan T. Milner was arrested on suspicion of first-degree assault and booked into the Spokane County Jail shortly after the alleged stabbing of Donald Milner in the early hours of Dec. 18 at a home at 5605 N. Drumheller St. Dennis Milner, Ryan's grandfather and Donald's father, called 911 after he awoke to Donald screaming for help in the bathroom, court records say. He got up and saw Donald covered in blood sitting on the toilet while Ryan was sitting on a mat in front of the shower holding a knife above his head, Dennis told police. Dennis grabbed Ryan's arm, causing him to drop the knife. Dennis threw the knife in the garbage can and called 911 as Ryan walked out of the house, according to documents. Police seized a bloody folding knife from a garbage can in the kitchen, documents say. Dennis told police he, Donald and Ryan had a good time together that night at the Drumheller Street house before the eldest Milner went to bed. Dennis said in documents that Ryan and Donald had been drinking, but he didn't know what led to the stabbing because no one argued before he went to bed. Donald told police the stabbing was an attempted murder-suicide by Ryan, his nephew. He said he lives with Ryan at the Drumheller Street home, and they were drinking when Ryan started talking about him, Dennis and Ryan committing suicide together, documents say. Donald said this might have had to do with a recent cancer diagnosis Donald received. Donald told police he excused himself from the conversation after expressing he and Dennis did not want to commit suicide. In the bathroom, Ryan pulled out a folding knife and started stabbing Donald, who shouted for help, Donald told police. Dennis arrived a few minutes later and pulled Ryan off Donald. Donald said in documents if he hadn't shouted for help and Dennis hadn't intervened, Ryan would have killed him. Donald said Ryan likely believed he was doing Donald a favor by killing him, so he didn't have to endure cancer treatment. Before speaking with Donald, police contacted Ryan in front of the house smoking a cigarette. He appeared highly intoxicated, unsteady on his feet, was slurring his words and was more concerned with smoking his cigarette than dealing with the officers, according to police in documents. Police detained Ryan. He declined to answer questions but then changed his mind and agreed to talk. Then, an officer asked Ryan what happened that night, and Ryan told the officer he would not speak to him with his body camera on, so the interrogation ended, court records show. Ryan's clothing, shoes and hands were covered in blood, documents say. Ryan complained about a knee injury, which happened as a result of, ""Helping the guy I was trying to murder. Take me in,"" Ryan reportedly told police. Police noted several lacerations and puncture wounds to Donald's hands and head. Donald, who also appeared to be extremely intoxicated, had a large amount of blood on the back of his head. The bathroom was also covered in blood, police wrote in documents. Donald was taken to Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center. There, medical staff identified several wounds on the back and side of his head, one on his bicep and several on the back of his hands. Police said the injuries appeared consistent with Donald being stabbed in the head while he tried to shield his head with his hands, according to documents. Ryan is scheduled for trial Feb. 24 in Spokane County Superior Court. He remained in jail Friday on a $50,000 bond. Phone messages on Friday to the jail seeking comment from Ryan were not returned.",0,[],2025-01-06 03:53:06,2025-01-06 20:10:37

The fraudulent message from a Montreal area code, which uses the city’s logo, instructs people to pay $4.35 to avoid ‘late fees of 35$’. It provides a link to a deceptive .com website that is not the boston.gov website. At-large City Councilor Erin Murphy is among the growing list of people targeted by the scam over the weekend. “At first glance, absolutely looked real. Could easily scam people,” said Murphy. “Almost everyone I talked to, they got it or someone in their household got it.” Murphy said she’s heard directly from people who were tricked by the message and compromised their banking information. “It’s scary to know that someone was able to send that many text messages out, and they were targeting Boston phone numbers,” she said. Boston police are still trying to figure out what phone database the scammers accessed and exactly how many people received the text message scam. “They definitely got a lot of people, and the amount, $4.35, a few people said that was the fee they paid at a parking meter,” said Murphy. “It directed them to a website that looked very similar to the city of Boston website.” Boston 25 News spoke with a handful of people who received the fraudulent message. Some said they too almost fell for it. One person said they didn’t own a vehicle and knew it was a scam right away. The message has some grammatical errors and uses a ‘$’ sign after the number 35. Boston 25 News called the phone number it came from, and it went directly to a voice message in French. “Don’t feel embarrassed if you did pay it,” added Murphy. “Let us know so we can help track to make sure there’s no fraud going on or no money taken.” While city officials recently announced a significant drop in violent crime and other serious crimes, one of the crimes that remain on the rise is financial fraud.

David Egan-Robertson from UW-Madison recently presented his 63-page report to the school board, with his projections showing the school district will continue to see a steady enrollment decline. Egan-Robertson works in the University’s Applied Population Laboratory, and all models he ran showed a steady enrollment decline through 2034-35. “A big part of the story is just smaller families and fewer children,” he told the board at their December meeting. “We do have to make some assumptions about births.” The pre-K enrollment in 2015-16 was 367; this year that pre-k enrollment was 303. A projection Egan-Robertson ran indicated that number would decline to 271 by 2029-2030 and down to 234 by 2034-35. The enrollment declines have been low, but are adding up. In 2015-16, enrollment district-wide was 5,102. This year, enrollment was 4,535, or 577 fewer students. “The enrollment this fall was 11% lower than 2016 — you’ve been losing about 1% a year over the past decade,” Egan-Robertson said. Even more concerning, the elementary school enrollment is down 16% since 2015-16, he wrote. Some suburban districts in Madison are seeing student growth, but rural areas in Wisconsin are generally declining, he said. Also, the number of new students entering kindergarten and first grade are not matching the number of kids who are juniors and seniors. “You’ve got smaller cohorts entering the system, and larger cohorts graduating and moving on,” he said. “It’s showing up in virtually all districts around the state.” Egan-Robertson estimated the high school enrollment will decline from about 1,440 students across grades 9-12 to 1,350. In the elementary schools, the enrollment declines range from -3% to -12%, he added. Births in the district are declining by six to eight children a year, leading to a 15% decline in children ranging from newborns to age 4 in 2020, compared to 2010, he said. Another problem is the gap between students enrolling into the district and the students opting to enroll elsewhere is widening. This year, 205 students open-enrolled in, but 429 enrolled elsewhere, he said. “Private school attendance has increased rapidly since 2019-20,” Egan-Robertson wrote. “While it cannot be said with certainty that every privately enrolled student is a resident of the district, private schools within the district’s borders saw their enrollments rise from 575 in 2019-20 to 876 in 2023-24.” There are several new private schools in the district’s boundaries in recent years, and Veritas Academy is planning to open its charter school on the East Hill in the fall, not far from Parkview Elementary. While new births are down, more people are now living in the boundaries of the school district, he added. In 2010, about 33,046 people lived in the school district’s borders, but that population had grown to 35,834 by 2020. “The population grew at a healthy rate, at about eight percent,” he said. The school board just started working on a study to possibly revise the borders for the six elementary schools. The goal is to have that study completed by spring, with any changes to the borders implemented for the fall. “It’s very timely with the work our boundary committee is doing,” Business Manager Chad Trowbridge said of the population study.",0,[],2025-01-06 03:53:06,2025-01-06 20:09:46

The body of 22-year-old Angelina Wall was found at about 5:45 a.m. Jan. 6, 2001, along Highway J, west of Fall Creek. She was found on the snow-covered south shoulder of the highway, south of U.S. 12. Wall was last seen between 2:35 and 2:40 a.m. at a gas station on Birch Street in Eau Claire. She left work at about 1:40 a.m. from McDonald’s on South Hastings Way. Police believe she was walking toward her home on North Dewey Street when she was abducted. “Despite the decades that have passed, the Eau Claire County Sheriff’s Office will never forget about, ignore, or give up on finding the person or persons responsible for Angelina’s death,” Sheriff Dave Riewestahl said in a press release last week, in advance of today’s anniversary of her death. “Her case remains an active investigation, and a team of experienced and well-trained investigators and other law enforcement partners, continue to review leads, information and evidence associated with the case. “We continue to fight every day for justice and answers for the Wall family,” he added. “Angelina and her family are in our thoughts every day and this case will always remain a priority.” In 2021, on the 20th anniversary of Wall’s death, then-Sheriff Ron Cramer told the Leader-Telegram about being at the scene on the day Wall’s body was found. “You feel an obligation to Angelina and her family,” Cramer told the Leader-Telegram at the time. “An unsolved homicide gnaws at everybody who was on the case.” Cramer explained at the time that the sheriff’s department intentionally has withheld some information about Wall’s death and kept some details close to the vest so as not to compromise the investigation. “We’ve taken DNA from people we’ve interviewed. With changes in technology, we’re able to get more off of items with less of a submission,” Cramer said at the time. And if Wall’s killer is a transient, Cramer was hopeful the national DNA databank could link a suspect to the Wall case. The Sheriff’s Office is still seeking the public’s help with information surrounding the death.

Police responded to the area of 140 Main St. around 10:30 pm for a report of a pedestrian struck. They found Donahue lying in the parking lot of a 7-11. They determined he had been shot. EMTs pronounced him dead on the scene. Shannon Lundin said she grew up with Donahue in Charlestown, and have remained lifelong friends. “He was a kind, loving, vibrant soul,” Lundin told Boston 25 over the phone Sunday. “No matter how much he struggled, he always tried. He was a very, very loyal person and he believed in sticking up for those that he loved, and sticking up for things he believed in.” Lundin, a spokesperson for the family, organized a GoFundMe to pay for Donahue’s funeral. She says the community is still looking for answers. She added, “[Donahue] was down by the store. Some sort of altercation happened. I don’t know if he knew the person or not. The one constant thing I’m hearing is that everything was caught on security cameras and the police know who they’re looking for.” Police have yet to report any arrests in connection with the death investigation. Lundin continued, “When it comes to whoever did this, I really have no words to be honest.” The Boston Police Department’s Homicide Unit is investigating the incident.

In a message Sunday night, the Springfield district canceled school Monday due to inclement weather and icy roads. District offices will remain open but both seated classes and live virtual instruction for all students will not occur. Parents are asked to check the district's social media accounts for information about activity and athletic cancellations. This is the first closure of the 2024-25 year for Springfield. Students were last in class Friday, Dec. 20. Springfield is among the many Missouri districts handling snow days differently this year after Senate Bill 727 signed into law last year created concerns. It puts districts at risk of getting less state funding if they fall below 169 days. In early November, prior to any inclement weather, the Springfield district outlined the change. The biggest difference: After a specific number of days that school is canceled due to inclement weather, the district will switch to Alternative Method of Instruction, or AMI, which allows students to learn at home. For preschool, the switch to AMI starts with the second day school is canceled. For students in kindergarten and grades 1-12, the switch starts with the fourth day school is canceled. The cancellations do not have to be back-to-back. Students in preschool, kindergarten and grades 1-8 received an AMI packet in advance. Once the AMI kicks in, students will be expected to bring the completed AMI assignments to school the next day class is in session. The AMI days are handled differently in high school. Students in grades 9-12 will log onto Canvas on the morning of each AMI day. That's where they will find assignments from each teacher and other instructions.

A winter storm is expected to drop two to six inches of snow across South Jersey today, Jan. 6, with below-freezing temperatures waiting in its wake, according to the National Weather Service. The storm was expected to begin late Sunday and intensify through Monday, with snow potentially falling at a rate approaching an inch per hour in some hours, the weather agency said. Its Westampton office on Sunday declared a winter storm warning for most of South Jersey and a less ominous winter storm advisory for western Burlington County. The storm warning predicts snowfall of three to six inches in the affected area, with the biggest impact likely in the region's southern-most counties. It is to be in effect from 1 a.m. Monday to 1 p.m. Tuesday. The advisory anticipates two to four inches of snow in western Burlington County. It's to be in effect Monday from 1 a.m. to 10 p.m. Several school districts in areas that might be hit hard announced on Sunday that they would be closed on Monday. They included Collingswood, Gloucester Township and the Black Horse Pike regional district in Camden County; Deptford and Woodbury in Gloucester County; Hammonton in Atlantic County; and Bridgeton in Cumberland County. The Palmyra school district, in a part of Burlington County under the advisory, on Sunday said it expects to remain open. ""Travel could be very difficult,"" said the weather service, noting slippery roads and other hazards are likely to affect Monday's morning and evening rush hours. Gearing up for snow: How to prepare your vehicle for winter. Residents are asked to stay off the roads ""unless they must go somewhere,"" said Camden County Commissioner Al Dyer, liaison to the public works department. He said snowfall is expected to range from three to five inches in the county Dyer asked motorists to stay ""at least six car lengths behind our vehicles while they work and move any cars off the street and into a driveway. Please also remember that it is illegal in New Jersey to plow or shovel snow from private property into roadways.” Flight schedules could be scrambled, Philadelphia International Airport warned in a Facebook post. ""Passengers are reminded to check with their airlines for the latest flight information,"" it advised. Among storm-related shutdowns, court facilities in all South Jersey counties will be closed Monday, the state judiciary said. ""All business and court events will proceed virtually,"" it said. People seeking a domestic violence restraining order should go to their local police station. The snowfall is likely to stick around. ""Cold conditions will result in snow quickly accumulating on all untreated surfaces,"" the weather service observed. Wind gusts of 30 to 45 mph on Monday night and Tuesday will result in areas of blowing and drifting snow. And while sunny skies will return Tuesday, temperatures will stay below freezing for most of the region through most of the week. “If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food and water in your vehicle in case of emergency.” the weather service advised. ""Call 511 to determine road conditions."" In the event of a power outage, call your utility company so they can coordinate crews to restore power, said a statement from Camden County.

Prepare now for winter storms — PUC shares #UtilitySafety tips With Pennsylvania bracing for the first significant winter storm of 2025 — bringing a mix of snow, ice, high winds, and unseasonably cold temperatures — the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) this week reminded residents to prepare for potential storm-related power outages and take steps to stay safe during severe weather. The PUC also urges caution when traveling near utility crews working to restore service. Give crews plenty of room to work safely and slow down in work areas to protect both workers and the public. ""Winter storms can be challenging, but a little preparation goes a long way,"" said PUC Chairman Stephen M. DeFrank. ""Planning ahead helps protect your family and your home, and it supports the hardworking crews and first responders working to keep us safe and restore utility service during harsh conditions."" Winter #UtilitySafety tips The PUC offers these important tips for staying safe and prepared: Plan Ahead: Have flashlights, batteries, bottled water, non-perishable food, and any necessary medications ready. Charge Up: Fully charge cell phones and other electronic devices in advance. Stay Informed: Monitor weather forecasts and utility updates through social media and your local news outlets. Report Issues: Report outages or downed power lines directly to your utility company. Avoid approaching or touching any downed lines. Be Safe with Generators: Use generators only outdoors, away from windows and doors, and never in enclosed spaces to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning. What Utilities Are Doing Utilities across the state are already activating their storm response plans, which include: — Pre-positioning crews and equipment to respond quickly to outages. — Enhancing communication with emergency management teams. — Coordinating closely with the PUC, the Governor's Office, and other state agencies. — During storm emergencies, the PUC monitors utility operations closely to ensure a swift and coordinated response to restore service.

Here is what each level means. Level 1 Snow Emergency: Roads are hazardous with blowing and drifting snow and may be icy. Motorists should drive cautiously. Level 2 Snow Emergency: Roads are more hazardous with blowing and drifting snow and may be icier. Only those who feel it's absolutely necessary should be on the roads. Level 3 Snow Emergency: All roadways are closed to non-emergency personnel. No one should be driving during these emergencies unless absolutely necessary or if there is a personal emergency. Employees should contact their employers to see if they have to report to work. Drivers on the roads may be subject to arrest. More: What do snow emergency levels mean in Columbus?

Glenn ‘GT’ Thompson (R-15th District), chair of the U.S. House Agriculture and Rural Affairs Committee. “The industry that provides us most of the things that are essential in our lives. Food and fiber, building materials, energy resources.” “And what an exciting time,” he added. The Pennsylvania Farm Show is the largest indoor agricultural event in the country. The 2025 Farm Show features thousands of competitive agricultural events, more than 1 million square feet of hands-on agriculture education opportunities, a food court, and a 1,000-pound butter sculpture. Speakers on Saturday morning emphasized the theme of the 109th Farm Show, “Powering Pennsylvania.” “AG is a huge part of our culture and our history and our way of life, but it’s also the foundation of our economy,” said Pennsylvania Community and Economic Development Secretary Rick Siger. Siger said that the agricultural industry provides for nearly 600,000 jobs in Pennsylvania, meaning one in every 10 jobs is related to agriculture, according to pa.gov. “It’s an entire ecosystem, one that contributes more than $130 billion annually to our Commonwealth economy,” Siger said. Siger noted that Gov. Josh Shapiro listed agriculture as one of his administration’s top priorities in his 10 year economic development plan. Speaking to the Capital-Star following the ceremonial ribbon cutting, Pennsylvania Secretary of Agriculture Russell Redding described the current state of the agriculture community in Pennsylvania as: “it’s diverse, it’s strong, it’s growing, it’s fragile.” “There’s a lot of things that we’ve learned over the last year with weather, particularly on droughts and some of the flood sort of damage and issues,” Redding told the Capital-Star. “You look forward, you see a lot of change coming around immigration and tariffs and environmental stuff that all of that is the fragile part.” On Dec. 21, President Joe Biden signed a $100 billion disaster package, which included an extension of the Farm Bill, that was passed by Congress. Redding said that was “really important to Pennsylvania.” Thompson, who will play a prominent role in agriculture issues in the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump, struck an optimistic tone in an interview with the Capital-Star, lauding Brooke Rollins, Trump’s nominee to head the U.S. Department of Agriculture. “I will say, based on my knowledge and information, not only she’ll be a great individual to work with as secretary, but she will be the Cabinet member that’s closest to President Trump, and that speaks well for agriculture,” Thompson said. Rollins worked in the White House as the domestic policy advisor during Trump’s first term and led the pro-Trump “America First Policy Institute” over the past four years, Thompson said. “So she’s got a great relationship with the President,” Thompson said. “So between that and my relationship with the President, I’m excited about the future of agriculture.” U.S. Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.), a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, also told the Capital-Star on Saturday that he expects to support Rollins’ nomination, despite differences they may have on some issues. Fetterman said that protecting funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) would be his priority for the upcoming Farm Bill. Redding told the Capital-Star that he’s thankful that a one year extension of the Farm Bill was granted in late December and laid out a number of things he’d like to see as priorities in the legislation. “Number one is to make sure that both the food and nutrition stay united with our production policy, meaning that there are folks who want to sort of bifurcate the food nutrition from some of the farm policy stuff. We really believe that they have to keep them together,” Redding said. “Two: food and food insecurity issues are growing, not shrinking, so we can’t have a  federal farm bill that shrinks the food programs like our SNAP and our emergency food assistance and all of that,” Redding added. Redding also cited research and rural development concerns as important. The 2025 Pennsylvania Farm Show will run through Saturday, January 11 at the Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex and Expo Center in Harrisburg. Parking is $15 per vehicle, although admission to the Pennsylvania Farm Show is free. A schedule of events and more information about the 2025 Pennsylvania Farm Show can be found at Farmshow.pa.gov.

The State Auditor is squaring off against the House Speaker and Senate President for the right to audit the legislature. A measure voters approved in November. And, another deadline in this debate lands on Monday. “If there’s nothing to hide, then open up the books, let the sunshine in, and let’s look and make sure that we are able to identify potential challenges,” said State Auditor Diana DiZoglio. DiZoglio says she is ready to open the books and the audit of the Massachusetts state legislature after nearly 72% of voters in the Commonwealth called for in passing of Question 1 on the ballot in November. But leaders at the State House have pushed back citing separation of powers. “These are taxpayer dollars. It’s important that we are able to view financial receipts, state contracts, procurement procedures,” DiZoglio said. As well as the government’s use of NDAs or non-disclosure agreements. DiZoglio sent a letter to Senate President Karen Spilka and House Speaker Ron Mariano asking them to prepare to cooperate and respond by Monday. The law tied to Question 1 took effect officially on Friday, January 3rd. “That legislative leaders will finally start to cooperate with the Office of State auditor for an audit that every other state entity receives to help make government work better,” DiZoglio said during an interview. Boston 25 News reached out to Spilka and Mariano. Their offices said they have received the letter and are reviewing it. DiZoglio believes it’s clear that lawmakers should abide by the law. “The legislature is not above the law,” she said. State leaders have suggested identifying an independent firm to conduct the audit. DiZoglio believes that is lawmakers’ attempt to control it. She says if State House leaders don’t cooperate, her office will be pursuing litigation and court action through the Attorney General’s office.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/strange-comet-asteroid-hybrid-nothing-012122457.html,This Strange Comet-Asteroid Hybrid Is Like Nothing Else in The Solar System,,Science,ScienceAlert,4 min read,A unique time capsule from the dawn of the Solar System.,Michelle Starr,2025-01-06T01:21:22.000Z,"In the distant space out beyond the orbit of Jupiter lurks a strange object. Its name is Chiron, a type of outer Solar System body known as a centaur. But even among its fellow centaurs, Chiron is special – and new observations from JWST reveal how truly Chiron is like nothing else we've ever seen. ""It's an oddball when compared to the majority of other centaurs,"" says physicist Charles Schambeau of the University of Central Florida. ""It has periods where it behaves like a comet, it has rings of material around it, and potentially a debris field of small dust or rocky material orbiting around it. So, many questions arise about Chiron's properties that allow these unique behaviors."" The Solar System is brimming with rocky and icy remnants from its formation, some 4.5 billion years ago. Centaurs, which hang out primarily between Jupiter and Neptune, with orbits that cross the paths of at least one of the giant planets, are an interesting set. Chiron, for instance, has properties similar to those of asteroids, but also sometimes has comet-like activity. Oh, and it has a ring around it, like a little miniature planetary ring. Because Chiron is thought to be something of a time capsule of the formation of the Solar System, scientists are keen to learn more about this strange rock, but its distance makes it difficult to resolve. Led by planetary scientist Noemí Pinilla-Alonso of the University of Oviedo in Spain, a team of researchers turned JWST's powerful eye to see if it could observe details that heretofore have eluded us. ""All the small bodies in the Solar System talk to us about how it was back in time, which is a period of time we can't really observe anymore,"" Pinilla-Alonso says. ""But active centaurs tell us much more. They are undergoing transformation driven by solar heating and they provide a unique opportunity to learn about the surface and subsurface layers."" Chiron sometimes ejects gas and dust, like comets do. The researchers used JWST to try to see what that gas and dust is made of – not just what's in the space around the centaur in what is known as a coma (like the atmosphere of a comet), but what might be inside it. ""What is unique about Chiron is that we can observe both the surface, where most of the ices can be found, and the coma, where we see gases that are originating from the surface or just below it,"" Pinilla-Alonso says. ""Discovering which gases are part of the coma and their different relationships with the ices on the surface help us learn the physical and chemical properties, such as the thickness and the porosity of the ice layer, its composition, and how irradiation is affecting it."" They took observations in near-infrared, and teased apart the spectrum looking for absorption and emission lines that result from the absorption and re-emission of light at specific wavelengths by specific atoms and molecules. Similar observations in the past revealed the presence of cyanide and carbon monoxide. Pinilla-Alonso and her colleagues found carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, ethane, propane, acetylene, methane, and water ice. The detection of methane is particularly notable, the researchers say, with results that suggest that Chiron's coma is full of it. There's a joke in there somewhere about centaur farts, but we're too mature to make it. Scientists think that centaurs were once members of an even more distant population of Solar System icy rocks, the trans-Neptunian objects, or TNOs, that orbit the Sun out past the orbit of Neptune. Because they are so far from the Sun, TNOs are thought to be relatively pristine remnants of the formation of the Solar System, encapsulating the early composition of the cloud of dust from which the Solar System was born. As they come closer to the Sun, the ice in the centaurs can sublimate, releasing some of that material. The researchers believe that the methane, carbon dioxide, and water ice they observe on Chiron could be some of the pristine materials it inherited from the birth of the Solar System. Other compounds, such as the ethane, propane, and acetylene, could have formed on the centaur's surface as the result of reduction and oxidation – that is, rusting. ""Based on our new JWST data, I'm not so sure we have a standard centaur,"" Pinilla-Alonso says. ""Every active centaur that we are observing with JWST shows some peculiarity. But they cannot be all outliers. There must be something that explains why they appear to all behave differently or something that is common between them all that we cannot yet see."" The researchers plan to continue to observe Chiron as it moves closer to us, to see if there's anything about the way it changes over time and seasons that gives more clues about the natures of these strange, icy, erupting rocks.

Overnight lows are expected to drop into the 30s, with some areas north of Lake Pontchartrain dipping below freezing. Winds from the northwest, gusting up to 35 mph, will make it feel even colder, with wind chill or “feels like” temperatures in the low to mid 20s. The National Weather Service has issued a Cold Weather Advisory for the area through Monday morning. Monday will bring sunny skies but little warmth, as temperatures are expected to stay in the 30s to low 40s despite plenty of sunshine. Winds will remain brisk through Monday, adding to the chill. Temperatures will fall again Monday night, with lows in the 20s to low 30s. Frost is expected in many areas by midweek, particularly on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings. Daytime highs will struggle to climb past the mid-40s for most of the week. Rain chances return later in the week as a developing system in the Gulf brings moisture back to the area. While wintry precipitation is not expected, heavy rainfall could create localized flooding in urban and low-lying areas on Friday.

Lastly, expect longer response times. It may be an emergency, but police have to take the same precautions when driving in winter weather. Copyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

Snow will continue to rotate across the St. Louis region, resulting in the potential for an additional two to four inches of snowfall. Yes, snow; not the mix we had all day Sunday.

(WKRG) — As our community and neighbors continue to heal from the New Year’s Day terror attack in New Orleans, News 5 is hearing more accounts of that morning. 23-year-old Jaries Brown is from Mobile and an alumnus of Mary G. Montgomery. He was visiting the Big Easy with friends to ring in the new year. Mobile County Sheriff’s Office looking for man wanted for Christmas Day homicide “We [were] just down Bourbon Street,” Brown recalled. “We had a couple of drinks. We [were] talking and taking pictures, met up with a couple of friends that we’d seen from the city.” He said it didn’t take long for the early morning celebration on Bourbon Street to become a terrifying scene. “I started seeing poles coming down, started seeing people running,” Brown said. “Then I just [saw] a white truck and it was kind of like, tinted out and kind of dark, and it was just like running through people.” The driver of the white pickup killed at least 14 people and injured dozens more. After avoiding being run over himself, Brown recalled helping one friend, Alexis Scott-Windham, after she’d been shot by the attacker. What led to an Escambia County homicide suspect’s arrest “I looked on the ground. I [saw] Alexis. She was like crying,” Brown said. “I picked her up, started running with her and as I was running with her, I ended up falling and once I fell, that’s when I started hearing the gunshots.” After taking cover, Brown said he ended up reuniting with friends and describes a panicked effort to find a missing comrade. “We went to calling and calling his phone, blowing up his phone. He never answered,” Brown remembered. “He finally ended up calling us, telling us that he was at the hospital.” That friend is Vigor alumnus Brandon Whitsett. Brown said Whitsett was shot in the back and remains in the hospital. While Brown avoided injury himself, the attack continues to take its toll. Breeze Airways suspends service in Mobile “I just keep replaying when he was coming down, like hitting people and stuff like that, just keep replaying in my head, like, I keep seeing it,” Brown said. Now, he’s looking for ways to move forward. “I just thank God that I made it,” Brown said. “That is all I could think of. I just look up and just tell God, ‘Thank you for letting me make it out of that situation.'” Brown said four of his friends were injured during the attack. News 5 is still reaching out to learn more about their condition. Copyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

EMS stated they do not have spare oxygen tanks available. EMS asked people to only call 911 for “true emergencies,” as bad road conditions make it difficult for crews to respond in a timely manner. Road crews from both local and state departments have been out salting and plowing roads, but with freezing rain moving through the area many roads remained hazardous even after being treated. The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet District 8 Office reported around 3 p.m. that roads were a mix of water, slush and ice. Snowy road Roads around Pulaski have been salted and plowed, but the continued winter weather still makes driving conditions dangerous in many places. “For those who need to travel, please use extra caution and reduce your speed,” District 8’s social media reported. “Remember to give snow plows plenty of space—DON’T CROWD THE PLOW!” Pulaski County is under a Winter Weather Advisory through 7 a.m. Tuesday morning.

Here's what to know about how the city and community is addressing it.,"Stacey Saldanha-Olson, Topeka Capital-Journal",2025-01-06T01:07:50.000Z,"Topeka's snowfall Sunday neared record highs. Topeka received 14 inches of snow by 6 p.m. Sunday. That is the third largest snowfall Topeka has had after getting 15.2 inches on Jan. 9, 1993, and 17.3 inches of snow on Feb. 27, 1900, according to the National Weather Service. At 5:30 p.m., the temperature was 17 degrees with a wind chill of -4 degrees and winds of 41 miles per hour from the north. Visibility was between 0.25 and 0.75 miles. The Sunday night forecast called for snowfall ending about 7 p.m. and low temperature of -1 degrees with a wind chill between -3 and -13 degrees. Snow accumulation for Sunday night is estimated to be less than half an inch. Monday's forecast calls for mostly sunny weather. The high will near 17 degrees with a wind chill between -4 and -14 degrees, and a northwest wind of 5 to 10 miles per hour. Multiple school districts in the Topeka area cancelled classes for Monday due to weather conditions. Hayden High School and Cair Paravel cancelled classes, along with Topeka USD 501, Seaman USD 345, Auburn-Washburn USD 437 and Silver Lake USD 372. Shawnee Heights USD 450 was already scheduled to be off. Shawn Steward, manager of public and government affairs at AAA Kansas, said the organization recently switched dispatch systems, so it couldn't say for certain how many calls for service it had. Steward said AAA responded to more than 20,000 calls January and February of last year. ""It's usually a pretty busy season, lots of dead batteries, issues with tires, and then when you throw in the winter weather and the slippery roads like what we have now, then that increases the calls for crashes and slide-offs,"" he said. The bulk of crashes during winter weather actually come after the storm passes, Steward said. ""In general, at the height of storms, we generally see kind of a lull in calls as people stay off the roads as they're directed to,"" he said. ""I would anticipate that we'll have a very busy day on Monday."" Smaller trucks will start clearing residential roads this evening with the goal to make a one pass to provide means of accessing the neighborhoods. The city estimates that clearing all the city roads, including those in neighborhoods, will take two or three days. ""Our dedicated crews have been working around the clock to plow and treat roads,"" said Daniel Garrett, city of Topeka communications director, in a written statement. ""We have focused on arterials, collectors and hot spots. The ice and blizzard conditions have hampered our efforts."" Garrett said the city won't be able to properly plow as cars are parked on the streets, especially narrow roads. ""We kindly ask for the public’s patience as we work through this process,"" Garrett said. ""We want residents to to know that vehicles parked on the streets may make it difficult for our trucks to navigate or could result in snow being packed around them. We encourage residents to stay home and avoid driving if possible while crews work to clear the streets. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation as we work to make roads safe for everyone."" Brian Posler, executive director Fuel True, the statewide trade association that represent convenience stores and other petroleum industries, said most stores saw comparatively little traffic as customers stayed at home. Stores mostly have been able to remain open during the inclement weather. ""Only in the northeast corner are we getting any closures,"" Posler said. ""Our retailers take that mission very seriously, and we try our best to meet the needs of customers. And you know, in some small towns, we might be the only grocery store, the only option for folks, and so we really try our best to stay open."" In Topeka, several convenience stores owned by Haag Oil Company closed at 5 p.m. rather than the typical closing time. ""They decided it just wasn't gonna be safe for the employees and folks, so they decided to go ahead and close,"" Posler said. Topeka Rescue Mission executive director La Manda Broyles said the warming shelters have received more than 85 people and 20 animals. She said 270 people are staying at the rescue mission. ""The Warming Centers are full of needs, challenges, but most of all full of volunteers bringing compassion, respect, and hope,"" Broyles said in a written statement. ""So, many guests of the warming centers are sharing their stories, taking next steps towards healing and overall grateful to be alive! ""Many guests are helping volunteer themselves as a way to show their gratitude for the kindness of our community. Some guests are utilizing the Warming Centers for safety and rest and this step alone shows courage and success.""

https://www.yahoo.com/news/congress-certify-trump-electoral-college-010143857.html,How Congress will certify Trump’s Electoral College victory on Jan. 6,,Politics,WPXI,4 min read,The congressional joint session to count electoral votes on Monday is expected to be much less eventful than the certification four years ago that was interrupted by a violent mob of supporters of then-President Donald Trump who tried to stop the count and overturn the results of an election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.,MARY CLARE JALONICK Associated Press,2025-01-06T01:01:43.000Z,"The congressional joint session to count electoral votes on Monday is expected to be much less eventful than the certification four years ago that was interrupted by a violent mob of supporters of then-President Donald Trump who tried to stop the count and overturn the results of an election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden. This time, Trump is returning to office after winning the 2024 election that began with Biden as his party’s nominee and ended with Vice President Kamala Harris atop the ticket. She will preside over the certification of her own loss, fulfilling the constitutional role in the same way that Trump’s vice president, Mike Pence, did after the violence subsided on Jan. 6, 2021. Usually a routine affair, the congressional joint session on Jan. 6 every four years is the final step in reaffirming a presidential election after the Electoral College officially elects the winner in December. The meeting is required by the Constitution and includes several distinct steps. A look at the joint session: Under federal law, Congress must meet Jan. 6 to open sealed certificates from each state that contain a record of their electoral votes. The votes are brought into the chamber in special mahogany boxes that are used for the occasion. Bipartisan representatives of both chambers read the results out loud and do an official count. The vice president, as president of the Senate, presides over the session and declares the winner. The Constitution requires Congress to meet and count the electoral votes. If there is a tie, then the House decides the presidency, with each congressional delegation having one vote. That hasn’t happened since the 1800s, and won’t happen this time because Trump’s electoral win over Harris was decisive, 312-226. Congress tightened the rules for the certification after the violence of 2021 and Trump’s attempts to usurp the process. In particular, the revised Electoral Count Act passed in 2022 more explicitly defines the role of the vice president after Trump aggressivelypushed Pence to try and object to the Republican’s defeat — an action that would have gone far beyond Pence’s ceremonial role. Pence rebuffed Trump and ultimately gaveled down his own defeat. Harris will do the same. The updated law clarifies that the vice president does not have the power to determine the results on Jan. 6. Harris and Pence were not the first vice presidents to be put in the uncomfortable position of presiding over their own defeats. In 2001, Vice President Al Gore presided over the counting of the 2000 presidential election that he narrowly lost to Republican George W. Bush. Gore had to gavel several Democrats’ objections out of order. In 2017, Biden as vice president presided over the count that declared Trump the winner. Biden also shot down objections from House Democrats that did not have any Senate support. The presiding officer opens and presents the certificates of the electoral votes in alphabetical order of the states. The appointed “tellers” from the House and Senate, members of both parties, then read each certificate out loud and record and count the votes. At the end, the presiding officer announces who has won the majority votes for both president and vice president. After a teller reads the certificate from any state, a lawmaker can stand up and object to that state’s vote on any grounds. But the presiding officer will not hear the objection unless it is in writing and signed by one-fifth of each chamber. That threshold is significantly higher than what came before. Previously, a successful objection only required support from one member of the Senate and one member of the House. Lawmakers raised the threshold in the 2022 law to make objections more difficult. If any objection reaches the threshold — something not expected this time — the joint session suspends and the House and Senate go into separate sessions to consider it. For the objection to be sustained, both chambers must uphold it by a simple majority vote. If they do not agree, the original electoral votes are counted with no changes. In 2021, both the House and Senate rejected challenges to the electoral votes in Arizona and Pennsylvania. Before 2021, the last time that such an objection was considered had been 2005, when Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones of Ohio and Sen. Barbara Boxer of California, both Democrats, objected to Ohio’s electoral votes, claiming there were voting irregularities. Both the House and Senate debated the objection and easily rejected it. It was only the second time such a vote had occurred. After Congress certifies the vote, the president is inaugurated on the west front of the Capitol on Jan. 20. The joint session is the last official chance for objections, beyond any challenges in court. Harris has conceded and never disputed Trump’s win.

A quick burst of energy is expected to move into the region late Monday night into most of Tuesday. This energy is not particularly well-organized but it is enough for models to start picking up on decent snow chances for all of Southern Colorado. Snow looks to kick off during the early evening on Monday. Portions of the lower elevations may very well see snow as early as dinnertime at the start of the work week with better chances over the mountains to start things off. If snow does start to pick up more, be aware of a potentially tricky commute for Monday evening. Well after midnight, activity is expected to pick up even more. Heavier snow will push up over the Palmer Divide and on into the northern half of the viewing area. Widespread, although perhaps relatively light, snow will then push further into the rest of the viewing area by Tuesday morning. This may also lead to a slippery morning commute so be sure to give yourself some extra time out the door. Snow chances will generally start to fade by late afternoon on Tuesday with the south side of the viewing area seeing the last few flakes fall from the sky. If snow lingers a bit longer though it could impact our Tuesday evening commute. Here is what the FOX21 Storm team is currently thinking for snow totals. The Palmer Divide and portions of the higher terrain will likely see some higher amounts, but in general this system isn’t expected to pack a huge punch. With that being said, impacts may still be felt and snow numbers are subject to change as we get closer to the event! Copyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

Demi Moore won her first Golden Globe Sunday night in the Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy category, for her work in the outrageous, showbiz-skewering horror-comedy The Substance. But as she revealed in her gorgeous, teary speech, Moore’s first major acting recognition didn’t come because of an elicit cocktail. It came after decades of dutifully, bravely pushing boundaries, and a sensational, explosive performance in what turned out to be the best role of her career. “I’m just in shock right now,” Moore said as she gazed out at the ballroom, including her category’s nominees Amy Adams (Nightb----), Cynthia Erivo (Wicked), Karla Sofia Gascón (Emilia Pérez), Mikey Madison (Anora), and Zendaya (Challengers). “I’ve been doing this for 45 years, and this is the first time I’ve ever won anything as an actor.” With award-season favorites like Erivo and Madison in the mix, Moore’s win could be considered a surprise in the category. But her work in The Substance has won universal acclaim and Moore has been a fixture on the campaign trail. Most notably, if you watch the Hollywood Reporter Actress Roundtable she participated in with Madison, Zendaya, Angelina Jolie, Zoe Saldaña, and Tilda Swinton, you’ll see them in rapture with Moore as they fawn over her performance. The Substance and Moore’s singular work in it, particularly as the film careens towards its gloriously cuckoo finale, has some of the loudest buzz in the industry right now, picking up steam at just the right time for Moore’s awards chances. In The Substance, she plays an actress whose career has washed up as she’s aged, hitting a new low when she’s let go from her last gig as a popular fitness instructor because the company wants younger, fresher talent. She’s then offered and begins taking a black-market drug called “The Substance,” which creates a younger, more vivacious version of herself that she can split time on Earth with—but only works if both she and the younger version (played by Margaret Qualley) honor that trade-off. It’s lacerating, grotesque commentary on how the entertainment industry—and so many other arenas—dismiss women as they age, and the psychological toll that the desperation to stay young, beautiful, and relevant can have on a person. As such, Moore’s win for this project in particular is especially poignant, which she outlined beautifully in her acceptance speech. Thirty years ago, she said, a producer told her she was a “popcorn actress.” “At that time, I made that mean that this wasn’t something that I was allowed to have,” she said, clutching her Globe trophy. “I bought in and I believed that. That corroded more over time, so I thought a few years ago that maybe this was it. Maybe I was complete. Maybe I had done what I was supposed to be.” But then she got the script for The Substance and the opportunity to star in it: “The universe told me that you are not done.” She ended her speech with a message about what she’s learned from this experience, on behalf of all people who have “those moments when we don’t think we’re smart enough, or pretty enough, or skinny enough, or successful enough, or basically just not enough.” The lesson: “I had a woman say to me, ‘Just know, you will never be enough, but you can know the value of your worth if you just put down the measuring stick.’”",58,[],2025-01-06 03:57:04,2025-01-06 20:13:54

Celebrity couples were among the famous attendees to walk the Golden Globes red carpet. Leighton Meester and Adam Brody wore coordinating outfits, while the Sandlers' looks stood out. On Sunday, Hollywood's biggest stars arrived at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in California for the 82nd annual Golden Globes, hosted by comedian Nikki Glaser. Celebrity couples wore some of the most fashionable outfits of the night, arriving in coordinating and complementary looks. From Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco to Viola Davis and Julius Tennon, here's a look at the best outfits worn by celebrity couples on the Golden Globes red carpet. Leighton Meester and Adam Brody The longtime couple arrived in different shades of green. Brody wore an emerald suit from Prada. It consisted of a double-breasted jacket and coordinating pants. He wore a white flower on his lapel. Meester's sage gown from Versace was figure-hugging with a cowl neckline and a subtle sparkle. Adam Sandler and Jackie Sandler The Sandlers both wore black to the Golden Globes. Jackie Sandler's Tom Ford dress was backless, and the halter neckline was attached with a gold choker. The bodice featured a cutout that flowed nearly to her waist while a train extended behind her. Adam Sandler's look was monochromatic, as he paired a black shirt and tie with his suit. Mary Steenburgen and Ted Danson Danson, who was honored with the Carol Burnett Award at this year's Golden Globes, walked the red carpet in a navy tuxedo and a velvet bow tie. The strapless neckline of Steenburgen's black dress had a square cutout in the center, contrasting with the white flowers that adorned the bodice. She wore a black scarf around her neck, flowing behind her like a train. Viola Davis and Julius Tennon Tennon walked the red carpet in a traditional suit and sneakers, keeping his outfit simple to let his wife shine. Davis, who was given the Golden Globes' Cecil B. DeMille Award, wore a black sparkly gown with a dazzling cape across her shoulders. The cape shined with rainbow colors as she walked beneath the event's lights. Hannah Bagshawe and Eddie Redmayne Bagshawe and Redmayne both wore patterned looks to the Golden Globes. Bagshawe's long-sleeve dress was taupe, and it featured billowy sleeves that cinched at the wrist with ruffles, as did the high neckline. Gold polka dots adorned the dress, and the skirt had tiers of ruffles, creating a maximalist look. Redmayne's black-and-white look consisted of a checked jacket and pants paired with a cream top. He wore the shirt with the collar popped up and completed the outfit with black shoes. Miles Teller and Keleigh Sperry Teller Miles Teller kept his look classic, donning a black tuxedo for the Golden Globes. Keleigh Sperry Teller's semi-sheer blue dress was covered in intricate beading. Velvet fabric sat atop the halter neckline, offsetting a cutout in the center of the bodice. Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco The newly engaged couple coordinated their elegant looks. Gomez wore a dusty-blue gown with off-the-shoulder sleeves and extra fabric that she draped across her arm, while Blanco stood beside her in a fuzzy white suit and a matching shirt embellished with lace detailing. Sebastian Stan and Annabelle Wallis Stan brought a fun twist to classic menswear with a long suit jacket and skinny trousers — both of which had white stripes down each side. Wallis stood out in a sparkling pink gown with a corseted bodice and ruched neckline. Read the original article on Business Insider",0,[],2025-01-06 03:57:04,2025-01-06 20:14:51

Following a steep downfall in public opinion polls and an unhappy caucus calling on him to quit, three sources told the Canadian newspaper that while they don’t know exactly when Trudeau would announce his resignation, it is likely to happen before a key national caucus meeting on Wednesday. The newspaper added that it would not be identifying the sources as they “were not authorized to discuss internal party matters.” One of the sources, who claimed to have spoken recently to Trudeau, said that the prime minister acknowledges that he has to make the announcement before he meets the Liberal caucus so that it doesn’t look like he was edged out by his own party members. The three sources also added that they are unsure of who would replace Trudeau as the Liberal Party’s leader after his resignation, noting that it’s not clear whether or not he’ll leave immediately upon his resignation or stay on until a new leader is selected. The Liberal Party national executive group is slated to meet this week, according to The Globe and Mail. While Trudeau had been facing pressure from his party for some time now, tensions were exacerbated on Dec. 16 after his finance minister and deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland surprisingly resigned, citing spending gimmicks and a lack of serious initiative in dealing with President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs as reasons. “We need to take [Trump’s tariff] threat extremely seriously. That means keeping our fiscal powder dry today, so we have the reserves we may need for a coming tariff war,” Freeland wrote to Trudeau in a resignation letter she made public. “That means eschewing costly political gimmicks, which we can ill afford and which make Canadians doubt that we recognize the gravity of the moment.” Trudeau’s silence on the matter sparked concern amongst Liberal members of parliament who renewed their calls for him to leave. The Atlantic, Ontario, and Quebec caucuses have all claimed that the majority of their membership no longer supports Trudeau, per The Globe and Mail. Those three regions account for 131 of the Liberal party’s seats in the House of Commons. The party holds 153 seats to begin with. Meanwhile, the leader of the New Democratic Party that Trudeau’s Liberals rely on for support in the House of Commons, Jagmeet Singh, similarly called for him to resign in December following Freeland’s departure. In a post published to X on Dec. 20, Singh wrote: “Justin Trudeau failed in the biggest job a Prime Minister has: to work for people, not the powerful. The NDP will vote to bring this government down, and give Canadians a chance to vote for a government who will work for them.” According to The Globe and Mail, Trudeau reportedly told Liberal members of parliament that he would reflect on his future but would not announce any decision over the holidays. The newspaper adds that his closest advisors have been meeting with senior Liberals over the past two weeks to determine whether or not Trudeau can remain as leader of the party and Prime Minister until he is replaced.",825,[],2025-01-06 03:57:04,2025-01-06 20:14:55

She went for it anyway.,,Celebrity,INSIDER,3 min read,"Nikki Glaser prepared heavily for her Golden Globes hosting gig. She expressed hesitation over telling a Diddy joke, but went for it anyway.",Palmer Haasch,2025-01-06T03:40:04.000Z,"Nikki Glaser hosted the 2025 Golden Globes. Compared to Jo Koy last year, her monologue killed it. Despite expressing worry over a Diddy joke in the press, Glaser went for it on stage. Glaser said that she ran her monologue many times in clubs before doing it on the Globes stage. At last year's Golden Globes, comedian Jo Koy defended his poorly received opening monologue by saying that he only had 10 days to write it. In 2025, his successor Nikki Glaser — who was also nominated for best performance in stand-up comedy on television — showed up prepared. She still took some risks onstage, though. Glaser's monologue took shots at streamers like Paramount+ (which is streaming the awards show), Netflix, and Peacock, viral moments like the viral Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo ""holding space"" meme, and somewhat surprisingly, the rapper Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, who will stand trial in May on a sex-trafficking indictment. (Combs' attorneys said in a statement that he has ""never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone — woman, adult or minor."") ""That movie was more sexually charged than Diddy's credit card,"" Glaser said of the Zendaya-led film ""Challengers,"" prompting laughter from the crowd. ""I'm sorry. I'm upset too,"" Glaser continued. ""The afterparty's not gonna be as good this year, but we have to move on. ""Stanley Tucci 'freak off' just doesn't have the same ring to it. No baby oil this year, just lots of olive oil,"" she said, referencing the allegations of sex performances and baby oil usage found in Combs' indictment, and Tucci's proclivity toward Italian food. Combs' attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent outside regular business hours. Glaser ran through her monologue dozens of times in clubs ahead of the Globes. The New York Times reported that during one of those runs, Glaser expressed hesitation about telling a joke about Combs at the show despite it landing with the club audience. ""You promise you will still be hollering on your couch when it dies in the room? I don't think you will,"" Glaser told the audience after someone urged her to keep it in her monologue. Glaser told the Times the following day that she felt it was ""almost more important"" that the jokes in her monologue land for the people in the room than audiences at home. ""I don't know if I'm savvy enough to watch a joke that bombs on TV and still go: That's still a good joke,"" Glaser said. Luckily for Glaser, her joke about Combs — and later in the monologue, another crack about the possibility of other, yet-to-be-uncovered celebrity criminals in the room — landed with the in-person audience. The rest of her opening was a hit for Globes attendees and those on social media as well. ""Nikki Glaser is very very good at this,"" ""Daily Show"" host Jon Stewart wrote on X.

So in lieu of any real confirmation, the next logical thing is happening: People are absolutely freaking out online speculating about it. Holland wasn’t on the red carpet with Zendaya. In fact, a recent quote of his went viral—alongside a photoshoot of him looking absolutely ripped—in which he explained that he often doesn’t walk carpets with Zendaya “because it’s not my moment, it’s her moment.” When he joins her, he said, “it’s about us.” Whether or not the massive rock on that ring finger means engagement, at the very least Zendaya can celebrate being with a man who is a one-man parade of Green Flags.

The frigid conditions are impacting travel, with flights canceled. Snow is forecast for Washington, DC, as the area prepares for the Trump administration transition. Blizzards, ice storm warnings, and unpleasantly cold conditions are blowing into much of the northern US. The Arctic outbreak, dubbed Winter Storm Blair by the Weather Channel, is bringing heavy snow to areas in the mid-Atlantic region that haven't seen such weather in a decade, the National Weather Service warned. Heavy snowfall was seen in places like Kansas City, Missouri, where local media reported 10 inches of snow Sunday night. FlightAware data showed more than 1,444 flights within, into, or out of the US canceled on Monday as of 7:40 a.m. ET. More than half of Monday flights were canceled at Washington, DC's Reagan National Airport, while nearby Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport saw 109 flights, or 39% of those scheduled Monday, canceled. Kansas, Missouri, Kentucky, Virginia, West Virginia, and Arkansas have declared states of emergency, with New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy declaring a state of emergency for several counties. As of 7 a.m. ET time Monday, nearly 250,000 utility customers were without power across Kentucky, Indiana, West Virginia, Illinois, and Missouri, per PowerOutage.us, which tracks power outages across the US. The NWS Weather Prediction Service said Monday that the adverse weather would move toward the mid-Atlantic throughout the day, bringing up to 12 inches of snow and dangerously cold temperatures. Snow — possibly mixed with sleet and freezing rain — could also reach 10 inches in Washington, DC, where preparations are underway for Donald Trump's incoming administration and where the election results are set to be certified Monday. DC Mayor Muriel Bowser on Sunday declared a snow emergency which will remain in effect in the area until at least the end of the day on Tuesday, January 7, according to a press release from Bowser's office. Additional cold weather warnings have also been issued in Baltimore, Cincinnati, Louisville, and St. Louis, with officials warning to limit travel in the impacted areas, The Weather Channel reported. In all, about half the US population is expected to experience freezing temperatures over the next week, Axios reported. More than 10,300 flights on Sunday had either been delayed or canceled due to the storm, per Forbes, including triple-digit flight cancellations for Kansas City (MCI), St. Louis Lambert (STL), and Dallas-Forth Worth (DFW) airports. The numbers of impacted flights are expected to continue to rise. Airlines including American, Delta, Southwest, and United said they are waiving change fees for flights impacted by the storm.

You’re all so famous so talented so powerful, I mean, you could really do anything—except tell the country who to vote for. But it’s OK, you’ll get them next time.” After shouting out Zendaya’s performance in the film Challengers, Glaser joked, “That movie was more sexually charged than Diddy’s credit card.” As the crowd groaned, Glaser went on to joke that she’s “upset” too because “the after-party is not going to be as good this year.” “‘Stanley Tucci freak-off’ just doesn’t have the same ring to it,” she continued, digging in, adding that instead of baby oil, it would be “just lots of olive oil.” More jokes came at the expense of big stars like Harrison Ford, Nicole Kidman, Selena Gomez, and others. “Oh look, it’s two-time Holocaust survivor Adrien Brody!” Glaser remarked at one point. But Glaser saved her most pointed bit for last, predicting that it would be “memorable night” because five years from now, people would be watching clips on YouTube, spot someone in the crowd and think, “Oh my god, that was before they caught that guy.” “We could be making history tonight and we don’t even know with who,” she said. “He knows. Or she. It could be a woman. I think a hundred percent of the time it’s a man, but it could be a woman. Won’t be. It never is. Kind of like best director.” And with that, they started handing out awards.

In an interview with the Guardian published Sunday, Alwyn reflected on the couple’s more than six-year long relationship and whether or not he ever feared it would eclipse his career. “I have tried just to focus on controlling what I can control,” he said. “And, right from the beginning, I tried to focus on the things that are meaningful for me: friends, family, work, of course,” the actor continued. “So noise outside of that, I think I’ve done what lots of people who find themselves in the public eye do, which is just try and ignore it. If you don’t, and if you let all of that other stuff in, and if it starts to affect you and your behavior, you’re living from the outside in. And then you’re pretty f---ed.” The 33-year-old actor, who stars in one of the award circuit’s buzziest films of the year The Brutalist, went on to explain that he has “great family and friends and real things in my life” that keep him “tethered to the ground.” “So I don’t know how else to say it, it’s...just in a different room,” Alwyn continued. When asked by the outlet if he wants to move on from the public interest in his time with the pop star, Alwyn pressed back and said that he has—and the moving on is “something for other people to do” now. “We’re talking about something that’s a while ago now in my life,” he added. “So that’s for other people. That’s what I feel.” Alwyn and Swift were first linked in 2016 and were repeatedly photographed together in 2017, sparking rumors of a romance. It wasn’t until 2018 that Alwyn publicly addressed their relationship for the first time, telling British Vogue that he’s “aware people want to know about that side of things” but would rather keep things private and “talk about work.” While the pair worked together on Swift’s Folklore and Evermore albums and were at the epicenter of engagement rumors for years, by April 2023 it was confirmed that they had split. A source told People magazine at the time that Swift and Alwyn had “rough patches before and always worked things out, so friends thought they would take some time apart but eventually come back together” before adding, “ultimately, [they] weren’t the right fit for one another.”",1,[],2025-01-06 03:57:04,2025-01-06 03:57:04

""That’s the entire purpose of the Social Security system crafted by Franklin Delano Roosevelt nearly 90 years ago.""

""As the first president in more than 20 years to expand social security benefits, this victory is the culmination of a four-year fight to provide security for workers who dedicate their lives to their communities, and I’m proud to have played a small part in this fight,"" Biden said. The bill ends a pair of provisions — the Windfall Elimination Provision created in 1983 and the Government Pension Offset devised in 1977 — that curtail the social security benefits of some U.S. retirees receiving retirement benefits from another source, such as a local government or state-funded pension. In the House, 327 members and 76 Senators voted to stand with around 3 million retired firefighters, police officers, teachers, and other public sector workers who also receive pension payments, Mick McHale, president of the National Association of Police Organizations, told Fox News Digital. ""For over 40 years, the men and women, especially in the area of public safety… have been penalized as a result of the pension system that they belong to,"" McHale said. Biden also discussed his plans to visit New Orleans on Monday to grieve with family members of victims and meet with officials after the terrorist attack in the city on New Year's Day. Did Biden Do Enough On Terror? ""I've been there. There's nothing you can really say to somebody who has had such a tragic loss. And my message is going to be personal to them,"" he said. ""They just have to hang on to each other and there will come a day when they think of their loved one, and they'll smile before a tear comes to their eye."" The visit comes after 14 people were killed and dozens injured after police said 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar rammed a rented pickup truck into pedestrians on bustling Bourbon Street early Wednesday morning. Police fatally shot Jabbar after he opened fire on officers. ""We established beyond any reasonable doubt that New Orleans was a single man who acted alone. All the talk about conspiracies with other people, no evidence of that, zero,"" Biden said. ""He had real problems in terms of his own, I think, mental health, going on. And he acted alone in the same way as what went on in Las Vegas,"" Biden said. ""But there is no evidence, zero evidence of the idea that these are foreigners coming across the border, but they worked here, they remained here.""

Stars arrived at the awards show in bold suits and eye-catching gowns. Elle Fanning and Adam Brody wore some of the most memorable looks of the night. On Sunday, the 82nd annual Golden Globes kicked off at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in California. The biggest stars in television and film arrived on the red carpet ahead of the show, hosted by comedian Nikki Glaser. Hollywood legend Ted Danson was in attendance to accept the Carol Burnett Award, while Viola Davis was honored with the Cecil B. DeMille Award. They were just some of the stars wearing stunning ensembles. From dramatic ball gowns to daring suits, take a look at the best looks of the night. Miley Cyrus Cyrus arrived in a black, floor-length gown designed by Celine. It featured a halter neckline that plunged to her navel and was trimmed with silver beading, as were cutouts on the bodice. The neckline and cutouts formed a flower. The back of the dress was open, with strips of sparkly fabric connecting the gown. Zendaya Louis Vuitton designed Zendaya's orange gown. The form-fitting piece had a sweetheart neckline and hit Zendaya at the ankle. A train attached to Zendaya's waist flowed out behind her. She wore Bulgari jewelry. Sebastian Stan Instead of wearing a traditional suit, Stan's black jacket flowed to his calf and was trimmed with white, giving it a modern flair. His black pants ruched around his legs, and he wore black shoes. Nicole Kidman Kidman's silver dress had one shoulder strap and was backless, creating a design that was elegant in front and daring from behind. The custom Balenciaga piece was also covered in silver sparkles and had a train that glided as she walked. The actor completed her outfit with a ponytail. Dwayne Johnson The Rock posed in a shiny lilac top and a jacket in a slightly lighter shade of purple. He added a colorful brooch to his lapel and donned see-through sunglasses. Black pants and shoes completed the look. Sarah Paulson Instead of opting for a simple, little black dress, Paulson wore a dramatic gown decorated with feathers. The strapless piece had a short train, a fitted waist, and a sweetheart neckline. Paulson also wore vibrant blush and a statement choker necklace. Emma Stone Louis Vuitton custom-made Stone's red gown, which was strapless and puffed at the hips. The dress also had a satin belt that extended out on one side, and Stone debuted a short haircut. Cara Delevingne Delevingne chose a sparkly look for the night, wearing a high-neck, blue dress that was sleeveless. Gems trimmed the neckline, adding even more glamour to the look. Margaret Qualley Qualley's white dress had a square neckline, which was adorned with delicate beading. The dress cinched at her waist with a shiny black bow, and the skirt featured tiers of ruffles that almost seemed to hover around Qualley. Ariana Grande Grande's archival Givenchy Haute Couture gown first debuted in 1966, when Hubert de Givenchy's designs were heavily inspired by Audrey Hepburn. The yellow silk dress was hand-beaded on the empire waist bodice. The skirt flowed to her ankles and was slightly ruched. White gloves and Swarovski jewels completed the retro look. Colman Domingo Domingo played with patterns with his black and white Golden Globes look, which was designed by Valentino. His suit was black, and he paired it with a white top covered in black polka dots. He wore a scarf in place of a tie that formed a bow on his neckline, which featured both a checked pattern and stripes. Kate Winslet Winslet's single-breasted, white suit included a slightly oversize jacket and flared pants. Black sparkly flowers were embroidered into the jacket on the bodice and sleeve, adding dimension to the look. Viola Davis Davis' black gown featured a V-neckline and an A-line shape. The skirt flowed to the floor after being cinched at her waist. The gown was covered in delicate sparkly beading, which complemented the semi-sheer, multicolored cape attached to it. Zoe Saldaña Saldaña chose a brown Saint Laurent dress for the Golden Globes. The sparkly gown hugged her figure and curved into a plunge on the strapless neckline. She accessorized the look with a coordinating detached cape that functioned as a train. Kate Hudson Hudson's navy ball gown, designed by Carolina Herrera, had a strapless neckline and full skirt. The dress was covered in sparkly floral embellishments that glittered as she walked the red carpet. A coordinating choker necklace tied the look together. Alexandra Daddario Daddario mixed textures with her custom Vivienne Westwood dress. The asymmetrical neckline was covered in voluminous white feathers that spilled over the bodice, while the rest of the dress was made of sparkly black fabric.

The form-fitting dress, which shimmered as Kaling walked the red carpet, had a strapless neckline and a slit on the side. Cristin Milioti Milioti, who was nominated for her performance in ""The Penguin,"" chose a simple black dress for the Golden Globes. The gown's neckline was trimmed with angular, sparkly fabric designed to look like leaves, giving it a chic pop. That same trim was attached to Milioti's black gloves. Elle Fanning Fanning's glamorous taupe gown from Balmain featured a full skirt, which cinched at the waist. The V-neck bodice brought a modern edge to the gown's classic shape, as the top was covered in leopard-print fabric. Cartier jewelry completed the look. Adam Brody Adam Brody put a fresh twist on menswear with his deep-green suit from Prada. The double-breasted jacket had black hardware, and he accessorized with a white flower on one of his black lapels. Black shoes completed the look. Zoë Kravitz The neckline of Kravitz's black gown plunged nearly to her navel, where a white ribbon cinched her waist. The bow flowed out behind her in place of a train. Saint Laurent designed the dress. Eiza González Gucci designed the shimmering gold dress Gonzalez chose for the Golden Globes. The figure-hugging dress was sleeveless and featured a high neckline, contrasting with the back, which was nearly entirely open aside from thin ties. Rachel Brosnahan Brosnahan's deep-green gown was covered in architectural detailing, from the ruching across the bodice that flowed into one sleeve to a thigh-high slit on the skirt that allowed the fabric to cascade around her leg. The dress also featured a subtle ombré, turning nearly blue at the bottom of the skirt. Leighton Meester Meester's sage-green dress featured a cowl neck that dipped low on her chest. She accessorized with a simple diamond necklace and bracelet. Read the original article on Business Insider",1,[],2025-01-06 03:57:04,2025-01-06 03:57:04

(KTLA) – An investigation is underway after a man was found fatally shot in the street in Van Nuys early Sunday morning, officials announced. Officers with the Los Angeles Police Department responded to the 16100 block of Leadwell Street, at Woodley Avenue, on reports of an assault with a deadly weapon at around 5:30 a.m. At the scene, officials said police found the victim, described only as “a male, age unknown,” suffering from a single gunshot wound. Medical personnel with the Los Angeles Fire Department arrived at the scene and rushed the victim to the hospital where, despite life-saving efforts, he succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced deceased. In video of the crime scene posted to the Citizen App, a portion of Leadwell Street could be seen cordoned off with yellow police tape while detectives presumably worked to gather evidence. Parked at the curb was at least one recreational vehicle with a dartboard attached to the front bumper that had its upper half covered by a heavily weathered tarp. On the sidewalk next to the RV, a ladder, a table and extension cords were strewn along the path. It’s unclear if the area was a homeless encampment or if the victim was possibly living in the RV. Authorities said that, so far, no arrests have been made in the fatal shooting, nor was any description of possible suspect or suspects released. The identity of the deceased male is being withheld pending notification of next of kin. Anyone with information about this investigation is asked to contact LAPD’s Operation Valley Bureau at 818-374-9550. Those wishing to remain anonymous can call the L.A.

Nassau County executive Bruce Blakeman seemingly relented and released a statement Sunday saying that he would allow flags to be lowered for just three days—a significantly shorter period of time than most other municipalities in New York State and across the country. The period in question, Jan. 7 to Jan. 9, also notably would not include Trump’s inauguration day. Last week, Trump pitched a fit on Truth Social over the fact that flags would likely be flying at half-staff across the country when he is set to be sworn into office on Jan. 20. “The Democrats are all “giddy” about our magnificent American Flag potentially being at “half mast” during my Inauguration. They think it’s so great, and are so happy about it because, in actuality, they don’t love our Country, they only think about themselves,” Trump wrote to Truth Social on Friday. “In any event, because of the death of President Jimmy Carter, the Flag may, for the first time ever during an Inauguration of a future President, be at half mast. Nobody wants to see this, and no American can be happy about it.” Trump’s online supporters all agreed. “OUR FLAG SHOULD BE FLYING FULLY MAST FOR THE PEOPLES PRESIDENT’S INAUGURATION,” a Truth Social user commented on his post. “They Are Showing Us They Hate Us because WE CHOSE THE PRESIDENT AND WE Are Taking Back OUR POWER!” “Anything to disrupt President Trump’s Inauguration makes the Dems happy,” another user wrote. “I’m so sick of all of this.” Blakeman, once called a “mini-Trump” by New York’s Democratic Chair Jay Jacobs, has staunchly supported the billionaire over the years. He also spoke at a rally with Trump during the 2024 campaign and held an umbrella over the incoming president during a press conference earlier this year. Many Democrats were incensed when Blakeman seemingly sided with Trump and left the flags on Nassau County-run buildings flying high, despite both New York State and neighboring Suffolk County lowering theirs from Dec. 30 through the last week of January. Seth Koslow, a Democratic county legislator, told CBS News New York that “politics shouldn’t play into” the decision whether to honor a former president. “This should be about what’s right for a person who represented our country, who guided our country and then served our country when they were done as president, and it’s the right thing to do,” he said. Under Blakeman’s post announcing the flag lowering, commenters remained split on the decision. “Show some respect and fly them at half staff for the 30 days that President Biden called for. Stop being a partisan shill,” wrote one commenter under his statement on X. “All flags should be raised to their highest point. Enough with the nonsense,” wrote another.",602,[],2025-01-06 03:57:04,2025-01-06 03:57:04

The discovery, which was announced by the University of Haifa on Dec. 30, was made during an excavation in the Jordan Valley. Coincidentally, archaeologists found the coins during Hanukkah. In a press release that was translated from Hebrew to English, the university explained that the artifacts date back to the Hellenistic period. ‘Santa Claus’ Sarcophagus And More Ancient Religious Relics Among Big Discoveries In 2024 The coins depict Alexander Jannaeus, who was king of Judaea from 103 B.C. to 76 B.C. Jannaeus, a Jewish leader of the Hasmonean dynasty, predated the destruction of the Second Temple, which was a major Jewish pilgrimage site and closely related to the story of Hanukkah. Read On The Fox News App Pictures released by the university show the coins, which have different shapes and sizes, still retaining faint symbols. The cache, which is believed to be the largest of its kind ever found in Israel, contains coins written in both Aramaic and Greek. Archaeologists Uncover One Of The World's Oldest Christian Churches Very few caches of coins minted under Alexander Jannaeus have been found by archaeologists, according to the University of Haifa. The university also said the coins were found in a ""road station,"" or a stop for travelers along the road leading to Alexandrion, an ancient fortress. They were discovered in a room that was likely used as a kitchen. ""The researchers are convinced that the site of the excavations in the Jordan Valley… is a road station that has not been known until now, on the main road that leads to the fortress of Sartaba (Alexandrion), which was built by King Yanai,"" the University of Haifa said in a Facebook post. Click Here To Sign Up For Our Lifestyle Newsletter The ancient rest stop where the coins were discovered also consisted of a mikveh, which is a ritual Jewish bath, and a pool or reservoir that was used to hold water. In a press release, archaeologist Dr. Shai Bar noted that the discovery was very meaningful to his excavation team amid the Israel-Hamas war. ""The students and the volunteer excavators in the excavation were very excited to find such an Hasmonean cache, and more during Hanukkah, and this added special significance to them… during the difficult days that pass on our people at the present time,"" Bar said.

If you purchase something from our posts, we may earn a small commission. Ever since I discovered infrared sauna blankets (which allow you to reap some of the benefits of saunas from the comfort of your couch, bed, floor, etc.), I’ve been touting them as my favorite wellness find of all time. Most at-home sauna blankets are basically like sleeping bags supercharged with infrared and controlled heat therapy, and I’ve officially waxed poetic about them ad nauseam. While I still regard sauna blankets as a sound and space-saving health investment for anyone looking to sweat with benefits, I have since graduated to the next level of at-home sauna tech: Heat Healer’s Energy Sauna, a compact (and actually aesthetically pleasing!) at-home sauna equipped with infrared, red light, and PEMF modalities in one sleek unit. Unlike sauna blankets, Heat Healer’s Energy Sauna is engineered with ‘triple threat’ technology, allowing users to reap the benefits of red light, PEMF (Pulsed Magnetic Energy), and infrared therapies all in one device. This larger investment piece is on par with the infrared sauna pods I’ve used at my local wellness studio, and that’s precisely how it was designed. “The Energy Sauna distinguishes itself through innovation with our triple threat tech, adding the combination of PEMF and Red LED to the already amazing Infrared Heat,” explains Heat Healer’s founder, Lauren Dovey. “These technologies, when used simultaneously, are amplified with the infrared heat relaxing you and penetrating your body. It also saves time instead of using separate devices for each technology.” As someone with little time for self-care, I appreciate the triple-pronged benefits of the Energy Sauna. Before diving into my review, here’s a brief explainer of the benefits of each of the three modalities the Energy Sauna harnesses. Traditional dry saunas (the kind you’ll usually find in spas and gyms) differ from infrared heat saunas in both the mechanism of heat and offering similar, though slightly different, benefits. “[Dry saunas] use heat from a furnace that heats up the air to heat up the body. Far-infrared saunas use the infrared wavelength (around 1440 nm-3000 nm) to heat up the body directly—not the air,” says Nilda Agnes Abellera, M.D., founder of Infuze MD. While both dry saunas and near infrared saunas are effective ways to heat the body and promote detoxification, pain relief, and post-workout recovery, she notes that far infrared saunas may be more tolerable for users than dry saunas. “Temperatures can go up to 150 degrees Fahrenheit in a far-infrared sauna and are much better tolerated than a traditional dry sauna,” she explains. ‘Father of Biohacking,’ Bulletproof founder and longevity expert Dave Asprey agrees, adding that infrared saunas are actually more effective in detoxifying toxins from the body than old-fashioned saunas. “Instead of heating you from the outside, infrared saunas heat up your body from the inside out. Infrared saunas are seven times more effective for detoxification than regular saunas,” he tells the Daily Beast. Aside from detoxification, some studies suggest regular far infrared sauna use may help improve cardiovascular health, reduce stress and anxiety, help with weight loss and maintenance, help fight chronic fatigue, and even extend your lifespan. The mat portion of the Energy Sauna is powered with PEMF technology, featuring four PEMF emitters that release bursts of magnetic energy designed to mimic the Earth’s natural magnetic field in the frequency range of 1Hz-30Hz. “PEMF works by penetrating deep into your body while stimulating the mitochondria in your cells. Your mitochondria are the powerhouse within your cells and are responsible for producing ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is the energy source your cells use to recover and repair,” explains Dovey. Aside from its energy-boosting effect, PEMF technology may help reduce pain and muscle stiffness by reducing inflammation in the body. These potential benefits, in conjunction with infrared heat therapy, make it a great post-workout recovery booster. I’ve noticed a significant improvement in stiffness and soreness post-workout when using Energy Healing following my exercise, and it also seems to help alleviate my menstrual cramps. Whether it be anti-aging face masks or adult night lights, red light therapy is having a major moment in the wellness space, but the technology is far from new. In fact, it’s been thoroughly studied since the ’90s when NASA researchers began looking at its cellular renewing benefits on its astronauts. “For decades, [light] has been researched by scientists who discovered that light in a narrow band of red and near-infrared can safely produce health benefits. The authors of thousands of published peer-reviewed papers believe that this band of light stimulates the mitochondria in your cells to create the energy we need,” Dr. Sarah de la Torre, Chief Medical Officer of Joylux, previously told the Daily Beast. When mitochondria are in an excited state, they release Adenosine Triphosphate and Nitric Oxide, which help fortify collagen, increase blood flow, and expedite tissue repair, which explains its laundry list of beauty and health benefits. “Light energy is now being used in various health applications—from wrinkle reduction, hair growth, and wound healing to a reduction of pain and inflammation, as well as an improvement in vaginal wellness and perineal recovery after childbirth,” Dr. de la Torre explained. While Heat Healer doesn’t recommend using the sauna with your head inside the domes, the full-body red light therapy is impressive—and you can easily control the intensity (or turn it off altogether) during your session. Of course, if you want to improve your skin tones, soften fine lines, or target sagging skin, you’ll have to wear your red light therapy face mask. Unboxing the Heat Healer Energy Sauna was slightly daunting; once the contents were revealed, the actual setup only took my husband and me about ten minutes. The sauna comes with two faux leather-lined domes, a PEMF mat, a removable, machine-washable cover that wicks away sweat, a head pillow, a Velcro curtain that attaches to the interior of the dome to trap heat, a digital control panel, and all the necessary cables to connect them complete with high-quality pewter connectors. The textures, visual design, and overall premium on quality were immediately apparent down to the study cables and super-responsive controls. I was immediately impressed by how well-made this thing is—especially for the price. The unit heats up super fast (within five to ten minutes) thanks to its unique dome shape and emissive nichrome heating panels. This is much faster than my infrared sauna blanket and the professional infrared sauna pod I used to use at the wellness studio. As with a professional infrared sauna, you do not put your face or head inside the dome, which helps prevent you from feeling overly hot, dizzy, or claustrophobic. Since starting to use this amazing at-home sauna, I have canceled my membership to the wellness studio I frequented for their infrared sauna sessions (which cost over $100 a month). The Energy Sauna gives me the same effect, sweat, and glow (plus PEMF therapy) with much more convenience. While I used a sample model provided by the brand for this review, this would likely pay for itself in a few months. If you’re someone who feels like you’re looking for the next best thing to an infrared sauna blanket or if you are paying for a membership to a gym or wellness facility, investing in the Heat Healer’s Energy Sauna is going to give you the same benefits and save you money in no time. While the Energy Sauna is much larger than the brand’s Sauna Blanket, it’s not an eyesore by any means. The brand did a great job in designing it using mutually nesting component pieces for the tube-like structure so that the pieces could be broken down and stored within one another at a fraction of their full setup size. Additionally, it comes with bags that are great for storage, safe travel, or preventing any spills or accidents (whether human or otherwise) befall your new precious wellness tool. It honestly even looks kind of chic once it’s disassembled and prepared for storage after use. Ideally, you’d be able to set this up once in a home gym or sauna area and leave it ready to use, but the beauty of this model is that even for those of us who lack the dedicated space to have a wellness or health room (or even multiple rooms at all), the Energy Sauna allows a premium at-home experience without taking up much of that premium floor space in your home. They have a five-year limited warranty and, even better, a lifetime trade-in policy. This means that if the brand launches a new model, you can trade your older version for the new one for 50 percent off the new model with the latest upgrades and improved features. If you’re concerned about radiation like I am, Heat Healer’s Energy Sauna is engineered with low to zero electromagnetic fields (EMF) radiation and “effectively zero” EMF levels at the default setting with PEMF therapy turned off. While you can use the Energy Sauna daily, Dovey recommends committing to 20 to 40-minute sessions at least three or four times a week to reap the most benefits. “I am on a mission to get our customers into the sauna 3-4 times a week. This frequency strikes the perfect balance, allowing users to feel the cumulative benefits of the sauna over both short and long term,” she says. In addition to consulting your physician before beginning any sauna routine, Dr. Abellera says it’s essential to stay hydrated and dry off after each session. “It’s important that you hop in the shower or towel off right after you exit the sauna so that any toxins you release don’t re-enter your skin.” All in all, Heat Healer’s Energy Sauna brings a trifecta of wellness technology to bear (red light, PEMF, and infrared heat therapies), offering you a unique suite of potential curative effects. With high-quality craftsmanship, a scientifically sound basis for the methods employed, and a sleek and convenient at-home design, the Energy Sauna may be just the perfect way for you to harness these studio-level tools with the flexibility of at-home use.",0,[],2025-01-06 03:57:04,2025-01-06 03:57:04

If you purchase something from our posts, we may earn a small commission. When I first heard that mouth tape was a thing, I thought it was an April Fool’s Day prank. How on earth could taping your mouth closed for eight hours not be insanely uncomfortable, harmful to your skin (ouch!), and make it borderline impossible to breathe? I was already skeptical, but some of its proposed benefits seemed downright far-fetched, including a more snatched jawline, improved sinus function, and reduced snoring. I wasn’t just doubtful; I was legitimately frightened by this emerging ‘wellness’ trend that had taken over my TikTok feed. Fast forward to two months later, and not only am I no longer horrified by taping my mouth (partially) closed every night before bed, but I’ve become a bona fide believer. While the research is scant and expert endorsements of the trending modality are mixed at best, many non-expert mouth tape loyalists say that the unconventional sleep hygiene habit has changed their lives for the better, including content creator, podcast host, and founder of my favorite skincare tool brand, Lauryn Bosstick of The Skinny Confidential, who called it “the best beauty tip ever,” and “like a ‘do not disturb’ for my mouth,” in a recent TikTok post. Unlike most lifestyle podcasters and small business owners, I trust this woman’s recommendations implicity. I mean, just look at her impeccably chiseled jawline. I was sold. The idea behind mouth tape is that it forces you to breathe from your nose instead of your mouth, which may help so-called ‘mouth breathers’ become ‘nasal breathers.’ Along with the aforementioned anecdotal aesthetic and wellness benefits of transforming from a mouth breather to a nasal breather, it could theoretically help alleviate bad breath, help with TMJ (temporomandibular joint) pain and dysfunction, and may even help relieve sleep apnea, according to neuroscientist and podcaster Andrew Huberman, Ph.D and corroborated by research published in recent medical journals. What I love about The Skinny Confidential Mouth Tape, which launched in April and initially sold out in just a couple of days, is that the pink, soft, and malleable tape features a small slit in the middle, so you’re I’m completely cut off from mouth breathing—and I can even still sip from my emotional support Stanley Quencher Tumbler with it on (yes, I’m officially a Basic Bitch™. As someone with a panic-prone anxiety disorder who needs to have water accessible at all times, this design feature was simply the only way I could get behind trying this new wellness trend. So, if you’re nervous about trying it, I would definitely opt for TSC’s mouth tape over other brands due to their consideration of these qualities and features.

Included in the claims was the bombshell accusation that Bayless made a number of sexual advances and even “offered her $1.5 million to have sex” with him. In a statement to the Daily Beast, Fox Sports stated: “We take these allegations seriously and have no further comment at this time given this pending litigation.” Representatives for Bayless and Faraji did not immediately respond to the Daily Beast’s request for comment. Faraji alleges in the suit that after starting work on Bayless’ Undisputed morning show, he would give her “lingering hugs after each haircut, putting his body against her own, pressing against her breast.” He then allegedly began to “kiss her on her cheeks.” She claimed that she would deny Bayless’ repeated advancements by saying that she didn’t date at work, or coming up with excuses to leave like needing to pick up her son from school. In July 2021 Faraji had a biopsy scheduled to determine if she had ovarian cancer. She then explained her situation to Bayless “hoping that he would take pity on her and cease his advances,” according to the lawsuit. Instead, the sports anchor allegedly “told her that he wanted to be with her” and made the million-dollar offer to her. Around a week after that incident, Bayless allegedly made another advance at Faraji where she told him: “Skip, stop, you have a wife.” Bayless then allegedly responded: “Aren’t you Muslim? Doesn’t your dad have three to four wives?” “Ms. Faraji responded that her father was dead, and when Mr. Bayless looked taken aback, she made an excuse to leave,” the suit continued. Elsewhere in the suit, Faraji alleges that network executive Charlie Dixon “placed his arm” on her lower back during a 2017 birthday party in West Hollywood and began “rubbing her body and grabbing her buttocks.” She also alleges that when she told Taylor about the incident, the on-air host allegedly told her to “get over it” and stated that she only had her job because of Dixon and that he could easily get rid of her. Faraji’s suit seeks class-action status on her behalf as well as other nonexempt Fox employees working in California over the past four years. She seeks unspecified monetary damages and a jury trial. “When Ms. Faraji and others came forward to report the wrongdoing, instead of addressing their concerns, Fox retaliated against them while the perpetrators and those who protected them were inexplicably promoted,” the lawsuit alleges. “This case thus represents yet another in a long line of cases chronicling the toxic culture at Fox, marked by bad faith promises and repeated failures to address a poisonous and entrenched patriarchy.”",2,[],2025-01-06 03:57:04,2025-01-06 03:57:04

The overturning of the Chevron doctrine in June limits federal agencies' power, complicating deregulation efforts. Deregulation delays could disappoint investors who have been pricing in less red tape since Trump's win. A recent Supreme Court decision could hinder one of the stock market's biggest reasons for rallying around Donald Trump's coming second term in office. Trump's election win in November excited Wall Street over the idea that a wave of deregulation was set to unleash gains for American businesses. However, the Supreme Court's June decision to overturn the so-called Chevron doctrine could hinder the Trump administration's deregulatory agenda, strategists at Carson Group said this week. The Chevron doctrine was a decadeslong legal precedent dating back to 1984 that empowered federal government agencies to interpret laws when legislation passed by Congress was ambiguous. The Supreme Court's precedent, set during the Ronald Reagan administration, was that courts should defer to the agencies rather than make their own judgment in such instances. However, since the precedent was overturned in June, courts are now dismissing federal agencies' interpretations of ambiguous laws. This was on full display earlier this week when the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down net neutrality rules. The three-judge panel specifically highlighted the downfall of the Chevron doctrine in their ruling. ""Unlike past challenges that the D.C. Circuit considered under Chevron, we no longer afford deference to the FCC's reading of the statute,"" the decision said. Barry Gilbert, investment strategist at Carson Group, said in a note on Friday that the Chevron doctrine was initially supported by conservative justices in 1984 ""because it made deregulation easier."" ""Overturning Chevron was great (from a Republican perspective) when Democrats are in power, but it also makes deregulation more difficult, which is why the original Chevron case went to the Supreme Court in the first place,"" Gilbert said. With Republicans set to hold a trifecta of power in the White House and both chambers of Congress later this month, the overturning of the Chevron doctrine could come back to bite them when it comes to enacting policies aimed at loosening regulations for the private sector, according to Gilbert. ""Some efforts to lighten regulatory requirements are likely to be met with waves of litigation that may take years to work their way through the court system,"" Gilbert said. What could have been swift deregulation policies enacted by President-elect Trump could now take much longer to play out as lawsuits inevitably make their way before the courts. ""We are worse off than the Reagan administration was before the Chevron ruling, because courts will be drawn into the messy process of delineating exactly what the new ruling means,"" Gilbert said. In a December note, UBS said that after the overturning of the Chevron doctrine, certain efforts to cut spending could also be impeded. ""The ruling also makes it harder to cut spending in areas that are well-defined in legislation,"" UBS said. UBS said that could impact the efforts of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, which seeks to significantly shrink the footprint of federal agencies. Eliminating entire agencies like the Department of Education would require 60 votes in the Senate. While deregulation is still on the table during Trump's second administration, it could ultimately happen much slower than during his first administration, which could set the stock market up for disappointment. ""It may make deregulation under the new Trump administration less robust than markets expect in places,"" Gilbert said.

According to online records from Texas’ Department of Criminal Justice, Saldivar is slated for a parole hearing on March 30. The parole review process in Texas typically includes an interview with the offender and a review of their file, namely letters of support or protest, before presenting their case to a voting panel per the Washington Post. The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles lists factors such as not having a repeated history of “violent or assaultive arrests or convictions” as reasons for parole approval, and reports that Texas’ parole approval rate for 2023 was around 34 percent. Saldivar is currently in custody at the Patrick L. O’Daniel Unit prison in Gatesville, Texas. On March 31, 1995, Quintanilla-Pérez, known by her stage name of Selena, agreed to meet Saldivar at a motel in Corpus Christi to retrieve financial records from her after finding out that she had been embezzling money from her fan club and boutiques. She was then shot to death at only 23 years old. During Saldivar’s trial, prosecutors claimed that she had intentionally killed the singer with her .38-caliber revolver because she was about to be fired. Meanwhile, Saldivar alleged that her gun accidentally discharged. She was ultimately found guilty by the jury and convicted of first-degree murder.",0,[],2025-01-06 03:58:08,2025-01-06 21:11:14

The discovery was made near the Highway 162 bridge, according to the Butte County Sheriff’s Office, not far from the site of a Saturday vigil for the brother. Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Megan McMann said a citizen walking along the roadway, about four miles west of Oroville, spotted the body and called authorities about 9:12 a.m. McMann said while authorities believed the body belonged to Wesley Cornett, 17, DNA analysis would be conducted to confirm his identity. The body was found not far from where Wesley and his brother, Andruw Cornett, 19, were duck hunting on Dec. 14. The older brother’s body was found in the waterway and positively identified on Dec. 31. Juan Heredia, a diver who had been searching for the boys with other volunteers, posted on Facebook that the younger Cornett had been located, saying the search “is over!!! We go back home!” He and others had been chronicling their search on social media. “We continued searching for Wesley on the surface as the sheriff brought cadaver dogs and restricted diving,” Heredia wrote on Saturday, what would have been Andruw’s 20th birthday. “Today, with full determination, I will dive. I am committed to finding this boy and bringing him home to his family.” Family and friends hosted a vigil Saturday night for the teens at Monument Hill boat ramp, not far from where the search had been taking place. Sheriff’s dispatchers’ last communication with the elder Cornett was on Dec. 14. Andruw told them that his brother’s kayak had overturned in the afterbay and he was going into the water after him. Neither was wearing a life jacket. Dispatchers urged Cornett not to go into the water in the moments before the duo disappeared. Nearly 300 people from county search-and-rescue teams, state agencies and private firms joined the search for the Cornett brothers. Three days after the teen brothers vanished, divers specializing in deep underwater construction and heavy marine salvage found Andruw’s pants on Dec. 17. Wesley’s wallet was located Dec. 19. Stanislaus County Sheriff’s divers found Wesley Cornett’s jacket with his phone inside the next day.

""I’m not at all sure that the election turned on any one or even a collection of foreign-policy issues. Most elections don’t. But leaving that aside: Americans don’t want us in conflict. They don’t want us in war. We went through 20 years where we had hundreds of thousands of Americans deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. People were tired of that, understandably. Well, when President Biden was vice president, he presided over the end of our engagement in Iraq. As president, he ended the longest war in our history, Afghanistan,"" he said, responding to a question about the election. The New York Times spoke to Blinken ahead of his exit from the White House and said that Americans were skeptical of Biden's foreign policy early on due to the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, which left more than a dozen American service members dead and led to the Taliban retaking control.

This, I think, is a signal achievement of the president’s.

The Times pushed back, noting that the Taliban has made it much harder for women in the country. Read On The Fox News App The interviewer said, ""In every possible way, the manner in which this was done and the state in which Afghanistan has been left could not have been what the United States desired."" ""There was never going to be an easy way to extricate ourselves from 20 years of war. I think the question was what we were going to do moving forward from the withdrawal. We also had to learn lessons from Afghanistan itself,"" Blinken added. The Biden administration was hit with pushback after the chaotic withdrawal. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan even reportedly offered to resign over the decision, according to The Washington Post's David Ignatius. Click Here For More Coverage Of Media And Culture Sullivan also reportedly had concerns about the exit, but ultimately said it would have been challenging no matter what they did. ""You cannot end a war like Afghanistan, where you’ve built up dependencies and pathologies, without the end being complex and challenging,"" Sullivan told the Post columnist. ""The choice was: Leave, and it would not be easy, or stay forever."" He added that ""leaving Kabul freed the [United States] to deal with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in ways that might have been impossible if we had stayed."" Ignatius reported that the Afghanistan withdrawal ""broke the early comity"" of the Biden administration's national security team, and created a riff between Sullivan and Blinken.

A lack of supply and an uptick in in-person neighborhood shopping has increased their value. One commercial real estate investor called the opportunity a ""retail renaissance."" Strip malls, of all things, appear to be trending up. After decades of decline brought on by the rise of large box stores, e-commerce, and the pandemic, the humble and sometimes derided neighborhood shopping center had long been on the outs. Many retailers shifted focus, buying and building large fulfillment warehouses instead of storefronts. That's led to a perhaps surprising shift, according to The Wall Street Journal: There is now a dearth of supply of convenient neighborhood shopping centers, and that is driving up the value of existing ones. Large investors like Blackstone have noticed and are now betting on the lowly strip mall. Blackstone spent $4 billion in November to acquire Retail Opportunity Investments, which owns about 90 shopping centers, most of them anchored by grocery stores. Blackstone President Jon Gray said at the time that he believes the extreme distress the commercial real estate market has faced in recent years is beginning to ease up. He now sees opportunity in the sector. ""If you were an investor in real estate after the financial crisis, you would have made a lot of money. And my guess is, if you're an investor today, the same thing will happen,"" he said at an event hosted by Goldman Sachs. Beyond just the value driven by scarcity, an uptick in in-person shopping also bodes well for the shopping center. Foot traffic to grocery stores was 12% higher in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same time in 2019, before the pandemic, the Journal reported. And there are many small businesses that still attract IRL shoppers, like coffee shops and nail salons. Flexible work schedules are also allowing residents to take quick shopping trips nearby. James Corl, head of New York-based private real estate group Cohen & Steers, wrote in a September blog post that the investment market for open-air shopping centers amounted to a ""retail renaissance."" Corl's firm bought a fully leased outdoor shopping mall in San Mateo, California for $127 million last month. ""Open-air shopping centers are the only major property type that is experiencing an acceleration in rental rate growth,"" Corl said in the blog post. ""We believe that a durable acceleration in earnings growth combined with relatively high current yields will propel shopping center investment performance for some time, a reality that the market has yet to fully recognize.""

He was exhausted and depressed. He was gaining weight and he couldn’t think.” She claimed that highly-decorated soldier was plagued by trouble sleeping, pain, concussions and memory loss due to the military service that he wasn’t ready to give up. CNN reported that he had recently sought treatment from the Army for depression. But the stigma that surrounds mental health in active-duty military members may have led to his downfall. “If he got flagged for having depression or having a [traumatic brain injury], he would’ve been made non-deployable and he absolutely did not want that. He wanted to be there for his guys,” said Arritt, who parted ways with Livelsberger, 37, in 2021. The two had met on a dating app, and bonded over the outdoors and time in the military. “I first met him after a recent deployment to Afghanistan and he was struggling with some concussions and blast injuries he had. He was just exhausted from the back to back tours,” Arritt told the outlet. Even though Livelsberger and Arritt lost contact for nearly two years, he messaged her the day before his apparent suicide, sending videos of the Cybertruck. In surveillance footage surrounding the hotel’s entrance, the Tesla was covered in flames after detonating. “The VA has gotten so much better about caring for these veterans, but active duty, they don’t treat them,” Arritt said. “They just keep them in the war until they’re used up and then the VA takes care of them after they’re out.” He received a Bronze Star five times, with a highly-regarded military career. He left messages that said he needed to cleanse his mind after killing people and seeing fellow soldiers die. He had an arm tattoo, with bullets going through two skulls, embodying the lives he ended in Afghanistan, according to the Associated Press. “I don’t know what drove him to do this, but I think the military didn’t get him help when he needed it,” she told the AP. “There was no weakness allowed and mental health is weakness is what they saw.” f you or a loved one are struggling with suicidal thoughts, please reach out to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline by dialing or texting 988.",0,[],2025-01-06 03:58:08,2025-01-06 21:11:28

The veteran offensive lineman was active, and will likely start at his usual left tackle spot, opening the door for rookie Patrick Paul to make his first start of the season at right tackle. Paul has started two games previously for Armstead because of the concussion he suffered in the first month of the season, and the knee injury that forced the five-time Pro Bowler to sit out all but two series of the Dolphins’ overtime win over the New York Jets. Armstead, who is concluding his 12th NFL season, has been battling injuries his entire Dolphins career, and that includes his struggles with his troublesome knees, which he’s had operated on multiple times. While he hasn’t committed to playing next season, according to Mike McDaniel the Dolphins would welcome the team captain back with open arms if he wants to continue playing. Armstead is slated to make $14.3 million next season, but will likely be asked to restructure his contract, much like he did before this season, dropping his salary into the $10 million range. “There are conversations that he has to have with his family and whatever, but what a huge piece of our team he is.

Rev. Jonathan Hall has been trying to figure out ""what’s ‘too political’ for a place of worship — or whether ‘being political’ is the whole point of the Gospel,"" according to a report by The Washington Post. Hall’s First Christian Church of North Hollywood, a ""politically-blended congregation,"" struggled with political differences before and after the presidential election, when President-elect Donald Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in a landslide victory. Hall, a native of Alabama, led the church north of Los Angeles for two years. He aims to unite the church, but it’s been a challenge. ""Persuading the Republicans, Democrats and independents in his pews to stay and pray with one another is getting more complicated,"" the Post reported. Christians Increasingly Persecuted Worldwide As 'Modern And Historical Factors Converge' Read On The Fox News App The Post reported further, ""When he preaches what the Bible says about the mandate to care for migrants, Hall focuses on the story of Mary and Joseph rather than modern-day wanderers. He selected a book of scripture readings that sets out specific text for every Sunday, so no one could question whether his picks were making a political statement."" ""And when somebody tells him they think a sermon was aimed at a specific politician, he says, ‘That’s one way to look at it!’"" Los Angeles has typically been a liberal city for several decades. The city has not voted for a Republican mayor since 1993. Data from the presidential election in November shows that Los Angeles residents voted for Trump more than what many polls had projected. Trump won more votes in L.A. than he did in 2020, receiving approximately 40% of votes compared to 34%. Furthermore, Trump improved his vote share across the country, starting with conservative areas but extending into deeply Democratic states. Faith A Strong Force In Jimmy Carter's Life, Say Leaders: 'Heart Of A Servant' Several congregants left the church due to their political differences. One of the members cited a film Hall planned to screen about Christian nationalism being ""too one-sided"" and ""anti-Republican."" Others left after they discovered their peers were attending Trump’s inauguration. ""Someone else walked out of services early on the Sunday after the election, feeling that a leader on the stage was too focused on consoling people who voted for Vice President Kamala Harris,"" the Post added. ""If you’re at a football game, one side wins, and everyone leaves. With a church [and the election], it’s like everyone is still there,"" Hall said. He went on to say, ""The popcorn is still on the ground, the Coke cups, the mess. Fifty percent of people are upset, and we have to pick up the pieces."" First Christian is part of the Disciples of Christ denomination and serves over 1,000 members. The denomination’s origin was founded to ""unify Christian groups who had broken over theology and worship styles."" ""If I’m a good pastor, I’m both comforting you and confronting you. But I also need to be a prophet, right? You’re supposed to come to church to look for questions that will change your life."" ""Before Hall, the same pastor had led First Christian for 52 years. Congregants say the late Rev. Robert M. Bock didn’t speak about contemporary political issues in church — even during the Vietnam War, which marked the start of his tenure. Hall is trying to forge a new way,"" the Post reported.

President of 9/11 Justice Brett Eagleson reacted to the news during ""Fox & Friends Weekend,"" calling the situation a ""horrific travesty"" as families remain outraged over the fact the death penalty could be removed as punishment for the suspected perpetrators. Judge Restores Controversial 9/11 Terrorist Plea Deals Involving Khalid Sheikh Mohammed: Report Brett Eagleson: It was a politically motivated decision to rescind it. We think that they knew all along that there was no way to do it, but in the heat of the election, in the lead up to November, they were utterly called out on the carpet for a horrific decision. Look, I haven't heard from a single 9/11 family member that thinks this is a good idea, and the reality here is that everything about 9/11, everything about this 23-year national nightmare that we've had to contend with, has been a horrific travesty from the days after 9/11. When the U.S. government worked with Saudi Arabia to cover up the Saudi Arabian role, to the time we sent 5,000 or 6,000 of our troops to be slaughtered in Iraq for no reason, to the very fact that Congress just denied the benefits for the first responders, now this… where we're getting these terrorist sweetheart cupcake deals. We've been kicked in the gut time and time again, and we're sick of it, and we are so hopeful that we finally have a president who's going to do the right thing here… One thing I want to point out is that on 9/11 this year, when VP Harris and Biden sat behind the red rope at the 9/11 World Trade Center Memorial, President Trump was… in a New York City firehouse. He was there with me, and I got a chance to talk to him. And we said to him, ‘Mr. President, you were right in 2016 when you said it was Saudi Arabia that knocked down those towers.’ He said it on this very show on ‘Fox and Friends.’ We said, Mr. President, we had to get the information not from the U.S. government, about Saudi Arabia's role, we had to get it from the British government. We said, ‘Mr. President, the same people who tried to take you down in Russia, Russia, Russia, Bob Mueller and the deep state of this country are the same people who have blocked justice for us. They’re the same people that came up with these horrible plea deals, would you do something to help us?' And he committed to us that day in a New York City firehouse on 9/11 that if he were elected president, he was going to do the right thing. He said he could deal with Saudi Arabia, and he was going to bring us final justice and closure, and we're going to hold them to account on that. And we're very hopeful. This is a new start for America. We have a Republican-controlled Congress, we have a president in the office who puts America first. So, let's hope that he really, truly does that. Read On The Fox News App Loved Ones Of 9/11 Victims React To Terror Defendant Plea Deal: 'Lifetime Of Pain And Suffering' Eagleson, who is the son of a 9/11 victim, was outraged by the decision, like many other family members, and is asking for more to be done. The plea deals would allow the three men accused of plotting the 9/11 attacks to plead guilty in exchange for being spared the death penalty. The court opinion, which has not been formally published yet, said the plea deals reached by military prosecutors and defense attorneys were valid and enforceable, and that Austin exceeded his authority when he later tried to nullify them. The Pentagon has the option of going next to the D.C. Circuit federal appeals court for emergency review, but the court docket did not show any filings as of Tuesday afternoon. A hearing is scheduled next week at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where Mohammad and two other defendants could plead guilty in separate hearings, with the death penalty removed as a possible punishment. The plea deals in the long-running case against the terrorists were struck over the summer and approved by the top official of the Gitmo military commission.

The agency said in a post to X on Sunday that scammers are posing as CBP officers and Border Patrol agents while promising money for information or threatening that law enforcement is on the way. The social media post directed to a previous warning from November that followed a ""spike of phone calls from concerned citizens about scammers."" ""If CBP suspects illegal activity, we will not call a suspect or a victim requesting money or social security numbers,"" CBP Houston Acting Director of Field Operations Rod Hudson said in a statement. Suspect Accused Of Burning Woman To Death On Nyc Subway Is Previously Deported Illegal Immigrant ""To be clear, CBP will not make telephone calls threatening citizens that law enforcement is on the way or promising money for information.

Some went so far as to give their targets fake case and badge numbers, according to CBP.

Residents on the receiving end of a call known as a phishing attempt should not provide the caller with any information. Phone scams can be reported to the Federal Trade Commission here.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/60-000-judgment-against-florida-194818623.html,"A $60,000 judgment against a Florida mover often accused of fraud and extortion",,US,Miami Herald,5 min read,"This is the same mover who a Miami-Dade judge called an extortionist who participated in an “unfair, deceptive and fraudulent” scheme.",David J. Neal,2025-01-05T19:48:18.000Z,"No state agency has charged former Broward mover Shawn Thompson criminally, although at least two have been investigating Thompson after customer complaints alleging fraud and extortion. But, an Orange County court hit Thompson with a civil judgment in December just as a Miami-Dade court did a year earlier. A final judgment from Orange County Judge Jeramy C. Beasley on Dec. 4 hits Thompson with $13,000 in basic damages, $39,000 in punitive damages and $430 in court costs — plus it awarded $7,720 in attorney’s fees to plaintiff Scott Meyer. Backed by an estimate, invoices and Zelle transfer screenshots, Meyer’s lawsuit said Thompson’s Moving Giants gave Meyer an estimate of $669.50 for a 19-mile Orlando to Oveido move on July 11, 2023, then morphed it to $1,801 upon arrival at the Oveido location via unapproved new charges. The new invoice said Thompson and Thompson employee Renee Carter would hold Meyer’s property until he paid the inflated price. Beasley’s judgment was a default judgment. Unlike the Miami-Dade case, in which Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Michael Barket said Thompson’s testimony showed him to be “a direct participant in this unfair, deceptive, and fraudulent scheme,” Thompson wasn’t deposed. He didn’t respond to the Orange County lawsuit in any way, court records show. The process server appointed by Broward Sheriff’s Office said in court documents that Thompson even gave the false name of “Sam Smith” when being served at 6742 NW 17th Ave., the address of several of Thompson’s companies at the time. However, the process server ran the license tags in the parking lot and found the dark Mercedes SUV with Florida tag 42D MHC was registered to “Shawn Eyon David Thompson.” A driver’s license photo lookup confirmed the 5-11, 250-pound “Sam Smith” was Thompson. When a Herald reporter asked about this judgment Wednesday via text message, Thompson replied with three texts that accused the Herald of violating his civil rights by contacting him and putting the number he uses for Thompson Nation & Affiliates in an article. “This is your final warning,” Thompson wrote. “I am not like all these bull ---- stories you write just to try to get a name for yourself without facts and these people you write fall stories about is reaching out to me to file a suit against you for lies. All your stories have no merit or truth to it. Write one more lies about me and I’ll see you in court.” A Jacksonville resident who said a Thompson company pulled a sudden cost increase extortion on him during a move from Fort Lauderdale forwarded the Herald an Oct. 16, 2023 email he received from Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services’ Chief of Mediation and Enforcement W. Alan Parkinson that said: “...we’ve received 98 complaints since the beginning of 2022 against Thompson Nation Holdings LLC. We have referred a case to our Investigative Section for review based upon the complaints we’ve received.” FDACS has yet to act against Thompson, but Miami-Dade online court records say the state agency’s general counsel office requested certified copies of the Miami-Dade case’s final judgment; the permanent injunction against Thompson, Thompson Nation Holdings and Small Move Movers that says, in short, any repeat of the fraudulent behavior will be considered contempt of court; and the deposition of Nicollette Gonzalez. Gonzalez filed the Miami-Dade suit after she didn’t pay $3,243 of extra charges for a Miami-to-Gainesville move and Thompson hid her furniture and clothes. The judgment awarded her $7,619 plus attorney’s fees. Meyer and Gonzalez’s lawsuits describe a bait-and-extort scheme described on a Reddit page devoted to Thompson; described on Better Business Bureau pages of Thompson-connected moving businesses such as Fresh Start Moving & Storage, One Man, One Van and others; on other mover review sites; and Charlene, 61, and Leroy Clayborne, 75, a married couple who moved from Palm Coast to Aiken, South Carolina. Charlene Clayborne wrote in a Sept. 12 letter they used Green Go Movers, one of the Thompson-related companies now based out of the 2814 Silver Star Rd. Orlando office used by Thompson Nation Holdings, Thompson Nation & Affiliates and other Thompson companies. A Sept. 12 letter to Miami-Dade Judge Michael Barket, the last entry on the Gonzalez online case docket, says a quote of $5,000 turned into a final invoice of $20,131 after the Clayborne’s house was packed. Then, according to Charlene Clayborne, Green Go demanded $14,000 before they would roll off the property. They accepted a “good faith” payment of $1,500, part of which was a $1,000 Zelle payment to Shawn Thompson at travel.payprelo©gmail.com that Wells Fargo flagged as fraudulent. Clayborne wrote, “I explained that WF flagged the transaction as being fraudulent and [Alexis] stated that was because it was a new account.” “Alexis” also told Clayborne, the customer said, that $6,131 in cash would be due on arrival or the possessions wouldn’t be unpacked. Clayborne said a “Bobby” called from Green Go the morning the truck arrived in Aiken, claiming they now owed $8,434. Clayborne said after the movers arrived, she told them she was going to the bank for money orders. “Damian was upset by this as he was expecting cash. l told him to contact the office,” Clayborne wrote. “I left my house, parked at the top of the hill and called the sheriff’s office. They arrived approximately 20 minutes later. After reviewing our contract and proof of payment, the movers were ordered to give us our belongings or be arrested for larceny and their trucks be impounded. “l should mention that the movers arrived with a U-Haul truck and a Penske truck and only two people, one driver each. They literally tossed our things in the garage and then the driveway causing lots of damage. We took a video of them unpacking the trucks.” A search of the U.S. Department of Transportation site doesn’t turn up Green Go Movers as a licensed interstate mover. USDOT No. 4176294, which is associated with Green Go Moving on another site, comes up as Thompson company Today’s Move Movers, which does business as Two Men One Truck Movers, ph. no. 863-231-4582. Neither is licensed to move anyone from Florida to South Carolina.",25,[],2025-01-06 03:58:08,2025-01-06 03:58:08

The FBI is investigating the attack as terrorism after police found an ISIS flag in the truck. The FBI also said the man stopped a multiple gun stores in Texas the day before the attack. The Army veteran who attacked a crowd in New Orleans on New Year's Day wore Meta smart glasses to record the area in advance, the FBI said at a press conference on Sunday. Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old US citizen from Texas, died in a shootout with police after driving a pickup truck through a crowd of people on Bourbon Street. Jabbar killed 14 people and injured dozens more in the attack. The FBI is investigating the attack as an act of terrorism after authorities found an ISIS flag, weapons, and a possible improvised explosive device, or IED, in the Ford F-150 pickup truck that Jabbar used. FBI New Orleans Special Agent in Charge Lyonel Myrthil said Sunday that Jabbar made two trips to New Orleans before the attack — once in October and once in November. In October, Myrthil said Jabbar stayed in a rental home in New Orleans for two days, where he used his Meta smart glasses to record the streets of the French Quarter as he rode around on a bicycle. ""Meta glasses appear to look like regular glasses, but they allow the user to record videos and photos hands-free,"" Myrthil told reporters. ""They also allow users to potentially livestream their video."" Jabar was wearing the Meta glasses during the attack, but he did not livestream it, Myrthil said. Myrthil also said during the press conference that Jabbar stopped at ""multiple gun stores"" in Texas on December 31 and visited one business where he purchased a white ice chest that he used to hide an explosive device. US military spokespersons told the media after the attack that Jabbar served in the Army from 2007 to 2015, during which he was deployed to Afghanistan from February 2009 to January 2010. He served in information technology and human resources roles at the time and was later an IT specialist in the Army Reserve from 2016 to 2020. He left the military as a staff sergeant.

A veteran and all-around beloved star, everyone in the Beverly Hilton International Ballroom was happy for Moore, with many on their feet for her inspirational speech.

After sharing her shock at winning the award, Moore shared what a producer had once told her about her abilities. ""Thirty years ago, I had a producer tell me I was a popcorn actress, and at that time, I made that mean that this wasn't something I was allowed to have,"" she said. ""That I could do movies that were successful, that made a lot of money, but that I couldn't be acknowledged. And I bought in and I believed that."" When she was at a ""low point,"" Moore said that's when the script for The Substance came across her desk. The actress said the movie imparted a rethinking of how we should view ourselves ""in those moments when we don't think we're smart enough or pretty enough or skinny enough or successful enough or basically just not enough."" She added, ""I had a woman say to me, 'Just know you will never be enough. But you can know the value of your worth if you just put down the measuring stick.'"" Moore closed her speech to rousing applause, saying that her win was ""a marker of my wholeness"" as well as the ""gift of doing something I love and being reminded that I do belong.""

""One way we can do that is by continuing to champion stories that are inclusive,"" he said in his acceptance speech. Stan starred in A Different Man as an actor who undergoes a medical treatment to eliminate his facial difference, radically changing his life. When he meets a charismatic man with the same condition he had, he becomes obsessed. ""This was not an easy movie to make. Neither is The Apprentice, the other film that I was lucky to be a part of ... these are tough subject matters, but these films are real and they're necessary,"" Stan said in his speech. In September, he told Yahoo Entertainment that he went through the script for A Different Man with Kaleb Yohay, a doctor who specializes in neurofibromatosis, and spent time scouring YouTube for testimonials from other people with the condition. He also spoke to a woman named Elna Baker, whose 2016 segment on This American Life details her experience with drastic weight loss that rendered her unrecognizable to her neighbors.

Welcome to the first wellness round-up of 2025. I’m Kaitlin Reilly and I’m sharing some health tips to get your week (and the new year) off to a great start. Want to do more good this year? Consider donating blood. January is National Blood Donor Month, and given that someone in the United States needs blood every two seconds, it’s well worth rolling up your sleeve if you’re able. In addition to helping others, donating blood can be good for your health. Just make sure to drink plenty of water before donating and, if you’re low in iron, eat plenty of iron-rich foods (like eggs, leafy greens, beans) the week leading up to your appointment. In the meantime, take a peek at the weather in your area and, if you are seeking astrological guidance, your horoscope. Then read these tips. We know that adding certain things to our diet, like spinach and eggs, can up our iron intake. What you might not know is that how you cook your food can also help. As The Grio recommended, cooking in a cast-iron skillet can significantly increase the iron content of your food, which is particularly important if you struggle with low-iron symptoms like fatigue, weakness or frequently cold hands and feet. Plus, there’s so much you can make in these versatile pans, from pizza to enchiladas to pasta. Remember the 2021 movie Yes Day, in which Jennifer Garner’s mom character allows herself to say “yes” to everything that her family wants for the day? It’s not just for family-friendly films: Hemisha Patel Urgola, a licensed clinical psychologist, told HuffPost that saying “yes” is a great way to bond with loved ones in the new year. “Allow everyone to pick one activity they would like to engage in that day with the entire family,” Urgola said. “Not only will you be doing something joyful, but you will be spending time with loved ones, which will inherently create moments of happiness.” Dessert for dinner? An impromptu game night? Just say yes! It’s a hot debate: Is wearing socks to bed cozy … or constricting? There’s a good reason to put on a pair before you sleep, Dr. Alex Dimitriu, a psychiatrist and sleep medicine doctor, told Yahoo Life. Socks warm your feet at night, leading the blood vessels in your feet to expand. This allows more heat to leave your body through your skin, helping to lower your overall core body temperature. This in turn signals to your brain that it’s time to doze off, allowing you to fall asleep faster, and potentially get deeper, more restorative sleep throughout the night. Do you regularly chomp on ice? It could be causing unwanted dental problems, experts told the Washington Post. Chewing ice can create tiny cracks in the tooth enamel, which may spread and lead to tooth fractures. It can also chip or break vulnerable teeth — and really, why go to the dentist more than you have to?! If you’re searching for a comforting crunch, you can try snacking on foods like celery or baby carrots, which are safer for your teeth. For people who love the cold sensation, go for frozen grapes, which might even trigger a dopamine release. If you’re looking to level up your diet in 2025, think about what’s good for your gut, dietitian Dawn Menning told HuffPost. This means eating more foods that feature probiotics, which Menning said “may improve the gut microbiome by stimulating growth and activity of healthy bacteria in the gut.” Foods like yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, tempeh and miso are all rich in probiotics, and research says that eating more of them may even lead to better immune function. A scarcity mindset is when you believe there aren’t enough resources to go around, which can lead you to hyperfocus on what you don’t have, whether that’s money, time or even something more emotional, like meaningful friendships. You can train your brain to overcome this mindset, though, and move yourself into an “abundance mentality,” therapist Larissa House told Women’s Health. One way to do this is by practicing gratitude, which science says can help boost your mood, improve your resilience and give you a more optimistic outlook on life. Do so by keeping a gratitude journal of the daily things you’re thankful for in your life, whether that’s a phone call with a loved one or a really delicious meal. (Not into journaling? You can also say these affirmations out loud for the same effect.) The term “brain rot” was named Oxford University Press’s word of 2024. If you’ve ever mindlessly scrolled on social media for an hour or binged a show until your brain felt numb, you’ve engaged in some of this so-called rotting — but is it a bad thing, as the name suggests? Therapist Brittany Cilento Kopycienski told Yahoo Life that “rotting” in moderation can be a chance to “mentally reset,” while allowing for a “break from constant stimulation where emotional recovery can occur.” That doesn’t mean you should stare at your phone for hours on end when you need to decompress, though — especially if you find yourself constantly doomscrolling, which can be terrible for your mental health. Try to redirect that energy toward a nondigital activity — like, say, taking a phone-free walk, or calling a friend instead of looking at their feed. One way to keep up with a healthy habit? Start a streak, researcher Danny Weathers of Clemson University told the Conversation. Weathers found that staying consistent with a habit can motivate you to keep going, as it both adds structure to your practice and gamifies it — you don’t want to “lose” by getting knocked off track! One way to start a streak effectively is to keep it simple. You may not have time to go for a daily 5-mile run, for example, but you can easily floss on the regular or start the day with a quick crossword. Do you consider working out a slog? Jah Washington, owner of Harlem Kettlebell Club, tells Yahoo Life that incorporating play into your exercise routine can bring you joy, rather than dread. Join a kickball league, grab a jump rope for some double Dutch or even join your kids' game of tag to try it out. More wellness tips: Read a book: It can help lower your blood pressure. Wear sunscreen on a plane to protect yourself from harmful UV rays. Exercise in the morning — you’ll be more likely to stick to the routine. Strength train — it may help you fight dementia.",0,[],2025-01-06 04:01:02,2025-01-07 01:17:39

How height can impact women and girls' body image.,,Celebrity,Yahoo Life,5 min read,"The 32-year-old shares her struggles with being 5'11"".",Kerry JustichReporter,2025-01-03T23:24:52.000Z,"Kylie Kelce stands out as a podcast host, WAG, pregnant mom of three and Taylor Swift-adjacent person. She also stands tall. The 32-year-old opened up about her height in the latest episode of her podcast Not Gonna Lie and she shared that being 5’11” was something she “struggled with” for a period of her life. “In high school, I’m pretty sure I was already 5’10” as a freshman and let me tell you something, the boys were not [5’10”],” she said during a conversation with influencer and body neutrality advocate Drew Afualo. “I got ruthlessly bullied by a couple of people. … The worst of them was a guy whose insult was always like, ‘You’re huge; you’re a man.’” She said that she had “always been taller than most guys” but felt “normal-sized” when she was around her family and her 6’9” dad. When she later married former Philadelphia Eagle Jason Kelce, she felt the same around the 6’3” football player and his fellow offensive linemen. But seeing her stature as a positive feature took time. “People taking issue with my size, they’ve always tried to use words that when directed towards a woman who’s supposed to be dainty, who’s supposed to be fragile, who’s supposed to be sort of this delicate something, and you’re going to look at me and be like, ‘You’re huge,’” she said. “I would be like, ‘I’m not big, I’m tall.’ Or like, ‘My thighs aren’t big, I’m strong.’ … I had to switch the narrative of not allowing those words to hold the weight that they expected them to hold with me.” Kylie’s body image took a hit and that’s unsurprising, according to Tanya Farman, an Indiana-based psychologist who penned her dissertation on the experiences of tall women, herself included. “I’m 6’2” and I probably experienced some of that bullying at younger ages. I myself did not grow up in a family like Kylie where my whole family was really tall, so I was a bit of an outlier,” Farman tells Yahoo Life. Despite the research that reveals the positive qualities attributed to tall adults, she and other experts acknowledge the toll that it can take on adolescents. During adolescence, appearance-based insecurities are extremely prevalent. While height might not be the primary concern, Sophia Spencer, a psychotherapist specializing in social psychology, tells Yahoo Life that it is “a particularly vulnerable issue” because it cannot be changed. “Unlike other physical insecurities, such as acne or hair loss, height is immediately visible and unable to be modified or concealed. This can mean during adolescence, tall girls feel constantly physically exposed, have heightened self-consciousness and likely receive unwanted comments about their height,” she says. Farman notes that for her it was “easy to hang my woes” on being tall, despite the myriad of reasons she might have been struggling with self-esteem as a teen. “I put all of my eggs in that basket. Like, if I was just shorter, I wouldn’t stick out in this way,” she says. The desire to fit an idealized aesthetic plays a major role for young girls. “Broader beauty standards emphasize a preference for women to be ‘petite’, ‘dainty’ or ‘light,’” says Spencer. “Traditional gender norms also suggest women should be shorter than male partners, and during adolescence this is particularly hard if a girl is taller than her male counterparts.” According to psychologist Robert Roopa, tall girls might “be believed to be or expected to be more mature simply because they may look older, and they may also be stereotyped to play certain roles simply because of their height, like playing center in basketball,” he tells Yahoo Life. For Farman, playing basketball and volleyball gave her height purpose. “But I could see for the women where that might not be part of their identity or their story, that it would kind of exacerbate sticking out, perhaps, at those young ages,” she says. The same goes for the idea that tall women have an advantage for modeling if they have other idealized features to fit. Studies have shown that being tall signifies a certain level of status, prestige and leadership over shorter individuals, and that taller people generally live better lives. So there are certainly advantages to it. However, Roopa says that perceiving your own height that way becomes easier only the further away you are from peers who may judge it negatively. At 45, Farman says her height is still something that people might comment on, though it happens less often and she perceives it as more complimentary or observational than negative. Spencer suggests that having a neutral perspective on it by “viewing height as a physical feature, no different to feet or arms” is most helpful for combating insecurity. Neutrality is the route that Kylie is taking. “As long as you can look yourself in the mirror at the end of the night and say, ‘Am I kind? Am I a good person?’ Those types of things … who gives a f*** if you tower over every kid in your class,” she said. Kylie opening up may already have made a difference. “Listened to it with my kids in the car and my daughter who gets tortured for being short was very enlightened and empowered,” read an Instagram comment. “She literally said, ‘I hope Kylie finds that mean guy and reminds him that tall strong girls marry NFL players, not some random guy from school.’ 😂💀”",1.3k,[],2025-01-06 04:01:02,2025-01-06 19:25:23

But where does the sequel stand?",Taryn RyderReporter,2025-01-03T22:41:46.000Z,"As Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni prepare to duke it out in court, fans of their hit film It Ends With Us are left wondering what this means for what was thought to be an inevitable sequel. The film adaptation of Colleen Hoover's bestselling book was a box office hit over the summer and found streaming success, too. However, Lively and Baldoni's dueling lawsuits confirm the two will never work together again. So, how did Baldoni get involved in the film in the first place? Where does the studio stand? And what does this mean for the film's sequel It Starts With Us? Here's what we know. In 2019, Baldoni's production company, Wayfarer Studios, bought the rights to adapt Hoover's bestselling novel. While promoting the film in August, Hoover recalled how he first got in contact with her about the project. ""He sent me a really lovely letter saying how much the book meant to him,"" the author told Yahoo Entertainment. ""And as we kind of went along in the process, he was like, 'Oh, I think I might want to direct this also.' He had just finished [directing] Five Feet Apart. I watched it and I was like, 'Oh you did such a good job with that movie. I feel like you would do a good job with this one."" Originally, Baldoni was not signed to play the role of Ryle Kincaid, the troubled love interest of Lively's character Lily. ""The idea of him playing Ryle came up and so he struggled a little bit,"" Hoover added, recalling how Baldoni wasn't sure if he could ""take on all of these roles and do a good job."" ""As you can see, he pulled it off,"" she said. The rights to Hoover's It Starts With Us also belong with Wayfarer. But after the press caught wind of Baldoni and Lively's dispute in August — despite many details being unknown — sources told Variety that the sequel is in doubt. ""This is uncharted territory, and nobody has any idea of what a sequel could look like,"" an insider claimed. ""There's probably no world where these two will work together again."" That puts it mildly. Lively is suing Baldoni for alleged sexual harassment, misconduct, retaliation and more. He denies this and is expected to file a countersuit against the actress any day now. Baldoni has already sued the New York Times for $250 million over how they reported on her 80-page complaint. (The Times says it will fight the lawsuit.) Baldoni's attorney confirmed they plan to sue the actress soon. Lively and Baldoni have accused each other's publicity teams of planting negative stories. Although Baldoni has the film rights to It Starts With Us, he indicated in August that he did not want to direct it. ""I think there are better people for that one,"" he told Entertainment Tonight on Aug. 6. ""I think Blake Lively is ready to direct. That's what I think."" Although Baldoni and Lively have very different takes on what went down on set, what's not disputed is that the two had creative differences over the final cut of It Ends With Us. Sony, which distributed the film, reportedly went with Lively's version. According to the Variety report, Sony has the automatic option to distribute a theoretical run of It Starts With Us, but can't do anything without Wayfarer's involvement. Sony has backed Lively, both over the summer when rumors of a rift between her and Baldoni first surfaced and after she went public with her harassment and retaliation allegations in December. ""Blake, Colleen and so many women put so much effort into this remarkable movie, working selflessly from the start to ensure that such an important subject matter was handled with care. Audiences love the movie. Blake's passion and commitment to advancing the conversation around domestic violence is commendable,"" Sony Pictures chairman and CEO Tony Vinciquerra told the Hollywood Reporter in August. ""We love working with Blake, and we want to do 12 more movies with her."" On Dec. 23, Sony issued another statement after Lively accused Baldoni and his publicists of orchestrating an online smear campaign against her. ""We have previously expressed our support for Blake in connection with her work on and for the film,"" a Sony spokesperson said. ""We fully and firmly reiterate that support today. Further, we strongly condemn any reputational attacks on her. Any such attacks have no place in our business or in a civil society."" In any other situation, a sequel would be fast-tracked. The film brought in $350 million worldwide at the box office. That's on a $25 million budget. Since its Netflix release on Dec. 9, It Ends With Us has been one of the top 10 most popular movies in the U.S.",459,[],2025-01-06 04:01:02,2025-01-06 19:25:23

The suspect — identified by the FBI as Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old U.S. citizen from Texas and an Army vet — proclaimed his support for ISIS in the hours before the attack, according to the FBI. One image shows Jabbar walking near Bourbon Street, a famed party street in the city’s French Quarter, just over an hour before Wednesday's attack. Jabbar was ultimately killed in a shoot-out with police early on Wednesday. Investigators initially said they believed Jabbar worked with others to pull off the attack and were searching for other suspects. But on Thursday, the FBI said it now believed that Jabbar acted alone. “This was an act of terrorism,” FBI Deputy Assistant Director Christopher Raia told reporters, adding Jabbar was “100% inspired by ISIS."" Authorities also said they’re investigating a possible connection to the Tesla Cybertruck explosion outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas on Wednesday, but emphasized that right now, there is no definitive link between the two attacks. Here’s everything we know so far about the deadly New Year’s Day attack in New Orleans. The FBI and other law enforcement officials said during a Thursday news conference that they are reviewing ""hundreds of hours of surveillance” of the French Quarter and other locations, and have received over 400 tips from the public. Raia provided a timeline of Jabbar’s actions leading up to the attack: On Monday, Dec. 30, Jabbar picked up a rental F-150 pickup truck in Houston. On Tuesday, Dec. 31, Jabbar drove from Houston to New Orleans. Early on Wednesday, Jan. 1, Jabbar posted five videos to Facebook between 1:29 a.m. and 3:02 a.m. declaring his support for ISIS. In the first video, Raia said Jabbar spoke of how he originally intended to harm his family and friends, but was concerned that news headlines wouldn’t focus on the “war between the believers and the disbelievers.” Jabbar also stated he joined ISIS before the summer and provided a will and testament. The FBI added that three phones linked to Jabbar were recovered. “Digital media exploitation is a priority to see what is on the devices and determine if there are any other potential leads,” Raia said. Two laptops were also recovered at a residence on Mandeville Street, and are being reviewed by the FBI. Investigators said they recovered an ISIS flag from the pickup truck, and FBI bomb technicians also found two improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in coolers: one that was found at the intersection of Bourbon and Orleans streets and one at another intersection about two blocks away. On Thursday, the FBI also released an image of one of the two coolers. President Biden said Thursday afternoon that he was briefed by the FBI saying: “They’ve established that the attacker is the same person who planted the explosives in those ice coolers in two nearby locations in the French Quarter just a few hours before he rammed into the crowd with his vehicle. They assessed he had a remote detonator in his vehicle to set off those two ice chests.” Authorities said the attacker drove around a police blockade on Bourbon Street early on New Year's Day and slammed a pickup truck into a crowd of people on a sidewalk, before getting out of the vehicle and opening fire at responding officers. The driver was fatally shot. Two officers were also shot but are in stable condition. The FBI previously said it had been investigating a residential area in Houston, with the help of local authorities in connection with the attack. Jabbar's younger brother, 24-year-old Abdur-Rahim Jabbar, told CBS News the two weren't close growing up due to their 18-year age gap. They did, however, bond in 2023 when they cared for their father after he suffered a stroke. Abdur-Rahim Jabbar said it was noticeable that his brother became more outwardly religious, but didn't witness anything that would indicate his brother became radicalized. ""This all just caught everybody completely by surprise,"" he told CBS News. Abdur-Rahim Jabbar said his older brother had gone through three divorces: one in 2012 in which his ex-wife obtained custody of their two children; a second divorce in 2016 and a third divorce in 2022. Jabbar had one child in the third marriage. The most recent divorce was quite costly, CBS reported, citing divorce filings. Jabbar said his monthly expenses exceeded his monthly income. New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said Wednesday that older security barriers protecting the Bourbon Street area were malfunctioning and had been removed before the New Year’s Day attack. “Bollards were not up because they are near completion, with the expectation of being completed before the Super Bowl,” she said. New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said, however, that police knew the bollards were removed and put heightened security measures in place. “We did have a car there,” she said of the area where the attacker managed to drive through. “We had barriers there, we had officers there, and they still got around.” The driver in the attack “defeated” safety measures put in place around Bourbon Street and was “hell-bent on creating the carnage and the damage that he did,” Kirkpatrick said. Reuters reported that a 2017 report commissioned by the city of New Orleans found the French Quarter ""is often densely packed with pedestrians and represents an area where a mass casualty incident could occur."" New Orleans police and the Orleans Parish Coroner’s Office have not yet released the names of the victims who were killed, but family members and universities have started to confirm some of the victims’ identities to multiple news outlets and on social media. Kareem Badawi, a student at the University of Alabama Martin “Tiger” Bech, 27, a former football player at Princeton University Drew Dauphin, a 2023 graduate of Auburn University Ni’Kyra Cheyenne Dedeaux, 18, a recent high school graduate Billy DiMaio, 25, an account executive at Audacy from New Jersey Hubert Gauthreaux, 21, a 2021 graduate of Archbishop Shaw High School in Marrero, La.

The College Football Playoff game was scheduled to take place at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans on Wednesday but was postponed to Thursday afternoon because of the New Year's Day attack. Kirkpatrick, the city's police superintendent, said on NBC's Today show on Thursday that New Orleans would see stronger security measures ahead of Thursday's game. ""We are going to have absolutely hundreds of officers and staff lining our streets,"" she said. ""We are staffing up at the same level if not more so than we were prepared for Super Bowl."" Bourbon Street reopened to the public on Thursday afternoon. “We are ready,” Mayor Cantrell said of the event and security, adding that the city is not only ready to host the Sugar Bowl but also future large-scale events.

Some areas could receive the greatest snowfall totals they've seen in decades, forecasters say. Watches and warnings for snow and ice extend from Montana to New York. ""Travel of all kinds will likely be very difficult and extremely dangerous across both the expected heavy snow and significant icing areas,"" according to the National Weather Services’s latest Friday update. To see if your area is under a winter weather warning, watch or advisory, you can check the National Weather Service’s website by state by clicking on “Land areas with zones.” Additionally, temperatures in the Midwest, East and Deep South will plunge as arctic cold surges are forecast for this weekend into early next week. The cold outbreak is expected to last through mid-January. North central to southeast Montana and northwest South Dakota will experience heavy snow, with snowfall totals forecast to be 4 to 6 inches through Saturday. Saturday night into Sunday, the central Plains, lower Missouri Valley, mid-Mississippi Valley and Ohio Valley will see heavy snowfall and significant ice develop. Snowfall totals from northeast Kansas, southeast Nebraska, northern Missouri, south-central Illinois, southern Indiana, northern Kentucky and southern Ohio could see snow totals of 8 or more. ""Across these regions, the expected heavy snowfall may be the greatest in the past decade for some regions,"" according to the NWS. While just to the south, ice accumulations of up to a quarter inch are possible from southeast Kansas, southern Missouri, southern Illinois, much of Kentucky, northeast Tennessee, Southwest Virginia and southern West Virginia. Meanwhile, through Sunday, areas downwind of all the Great Lakes can expect heavy lake-effect snow to the east and southeast of Lake Ontario, forecasters say. Northeast Ohio, northwest Pennsylvania and portions of western and northwest New York state could see lake-effect snow totals in the 1 to 2 foot range, ""creating very hazardous and extremely difficult driving conditions,"" according to the NWS's Friday bulletin. Portions of Michigan that are downwind of lakes Superior and Michigan are forecast to get up to 4 to 6 inches.

https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/winter-weather-how-to-keep-kids-safe-in-extreme-cold-142742961.html,Winter weather: How to keep kids safe in extreme cold,,Lifestyle,Yahoo Life,7 min read,"Layering, space heater safety and other tips parents should know as winter storms hit.",Priscilla Blossom,2025-01-03T14:27:42.000Z,"Winter weather is in full swing, with snow, ice and freezing temperatures expected across the country and experts sounding the alarm about the importance of being prepared. That's especially important for babies and young children, who experts say are particularly sensitive to the effects of extreme weather. “Babies are especially vulnerable to cold due to the fact that they have a large body surface area compared to their size, which causes them to lose heat more rapidly,” Dr. Esther Liu, chair of pediatrics and director of group-based care at the University of Maryland Baltimore Washington Medical Center, tells Yahoo Life. “Additionally, they don’t have the ability to regulate their temperatures as well when they are young,” she adds. According to Dr. Tiorra Ross, a practicing pediatrician in Houston, a lack of communication skills can also complicate matters. “Cold weather is more dangerous to infants and younger children because they cannot communicate to their caregiver their symptoms and express that they are cold,” she tells Yahoo Life. It’s important, then, to bundle up and take other precautions to keep little ones warm. But how much bundling is too much? And how long should kiddos stay outside when the snow is piled up on the ground? As families across the U.S. bring out their space heaters and snow pants and brace for extreme weather, experts share how parents can best protect their kids. Your child might be thrilled to have a snow day — but there are a few factors to consider before letting them loose to build a snowman. Everyone’s tolerance for cold weather is different, and parents should not let the temperature alone be their guide. Whether or not there is precipitation, Liu says, is important. “Getting wet will drop body temperature more because you lose more body heat through wet skin,” she explains. Additionally, wind chill can make a significant difference in staying safe out in the cold. “If [it’s] below -15 degrees Fahrenheit, it’s a good day to play inside. The risk of hypothermia and frostbite is in minutes of exposure,” Dr. Tracy Butler, a pediatrician and medical director at Pediatrix Primary and Urgent Care of Colorado, tells Yahoo Life. “Proper clothing and time limits can help avoid this complication.” Depending on where you live, avoiding extreme winter weather may be unavoidable — as is keeping children at home for long stretches of time. Here’s what health experts advise to offset the cold. Dress them in appropriate clothing. Pediatricians who spoke to Yahoo Life all recommend dressing your child in layers. “This allows people to find just the ‘right’ amount of warmth without overheating,” says Liu. This might include long-sleeved shirts, pants, socks, hats, boots, gloves or mittens (the latter are typically easier to get on a young child) and a water-resistant coat or jacket — especially if there’s any rain or snow. If you’re unsure whether or not you’re overdoing it, Butler offers this rule: “Dress them in one more layer of clothing than an adult would wear in the same conditions.” Protect kids from wind during walks. Braving the cold? “During stroller walks, shield kids from the wind [using a rain cover or weather shield that attaches to the stroller], consider the outside temperature and how comfortable you feel in the same and check on extremities occasionally,” Dr. Erik Johnson, vice president of primary care services at Pediatrix Medical Group, tells Yahoo Life. Liu also recommends considering adding blankets for this, when necessary. Monitor the time you’re spending outdoors in extreme cold. Everyone’s child is different, so pediatricians all say there’s no specific amount of time one can stay outdoors. However, there are additional things you can do to monitor the situation. “Depending on the outside temperature, set limits on the time they are outside and remind them to come in for warmth checks on a regular basis,” says Butler. “If they are shivering, it’s time to come inside for a break.” When the weather is especially chilly, there’s a good chance you might opt to drive your child to where they need to be rather than walk. But there are several rules one should follow to remain safe. Take coats off before buckling up. “No child or infant should wear a jacket while in a car seat or seat belt,” Ross says. “It is best that the safety harness is close to the body to provide the best safety.” Adds Butler: “Too much bulk can create extra room in the harness, causing a loose fit, and putting the child at risk for injury in the event of a crash.” Bring a blanket along. To stay toasty while the heater starts up, Butler suggests draping your young child in a blanket (over their car seat harness or seat belt). You can also put their coat backward on top of them. Be mindful of where your car is idling while it warms up. “The garage door needs to be open and the door into the house needs to be closed,” says Johnson. Don’t go overboard with the heater. You don’t have to keep it cranked at high heat for the baby’s sake. “The car doesn’t need to be any warmer than what you feel comfortable in,” Johnson notes. The recommended room temperature for babies is generally between 68 and 72 degrees Fahrenheit, and experts warn that overheating is linked to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Liu notes that older children, who are better able to regulate their body temperature, are typically more ""tolerant"" of wider temperature ranges in the home. As for the sleep environment, Butler says that for babies, it’s safest to keep blankets, quilts, pillows, bumpers, sheepskins and other loose bedding out. “While they are warm, they are associated with suffocation deaths. It is better to use sleep clothing like one-piece sleepers or wearable blankets,” she says. If you rely on space heaters primarily, there are a few rules for using them safely around children. “[Space] heaters should always be on a hard surface, preferably the floor, and kept away from children, especially crawling infants,” says Ross. She and other pediatricians recommend parents stay present when space heaters are in use for babies and young children. Liu also says space heaters should not be hot to touch (like radiators) and suggests having a model that includes an automatic shut-off mechanism in the event it tips over. “Space heaters should never be plugged into an extension cord, as the risk of fire increases,” adds Butler. She also advises against the use of fuel-burning space heaters, which put kids at higher risk of carbon monoxide poisoning. At the very least, have a carbon monoxide detector present if needed. Pediatricians recommend keeping an eye out for the following symptoms indicating that your child may be too cold: Shivering. Liu notes, however, that this doesn’t develop until a baby is around 6 months of age. Change in skin color. Ross urges parents to look for “discoloration” of the hands, feet and lips. Adds Liu: “Pale, cool skin is a late finding. Children will usually get red before getting pale, as the body tries to initially send more blood flow/body heat to the cold skin before trying to conserve body heat.” Complaints of pain in the extremities. According to Butler, children complaining of burning pain or numbness, especially in areas like the fingers, toes, nose and ears, may be experiencing frostbite. If this is the case, she recommends placing the “extremity in warm (not hot) water of around 104 degrees. Warm washcloths can be applied to the face and ears. Avoid rubbing the areas. If the symptoms don’t improve, contact your physician,” she says. Additionally, parents should be aware of the signs of hypothermia: Slurred speech Lethargy Clumsiness “If your child suffers from signs and symptoms of hypothermia, activate 911 for immediate help,” says Butler.",58,[],2025-01-06 04:01:02,2025-01-06 19:25:23

Why they haven't been updated in 36 years.,,Health,Yahoo Life,7 min read,Vivek Murthy wants warning labels to inform consumers of alcohol's link to at least seven types of cancer.,Rebecca CoreyReporter,2025-01-03T14:38:22.000Z,"U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy is calling for new warning labels on alcoholic drinks that inform consumers of the health risks — particularly an increased risk of at least seven types of cancer, including breast cancer, liver cancer and colon cancer. In the new report on alcohol consumption and cancer risk published on Jan. 3, Murthy also called for the guidelines on alcohol consumption limits to be reassessed. “Many people out there assume that as long as they’re drinking at the limits or below the limits of current guidelines of one a day for women and two for men, that there is no risk to their health or well-being,” Murthy said in an interview with the New York Times. “The data does not bear that out for cancer risk.” Ireland recently became the first country in the European Union (and second worldwide after South Korea) to better regulate booze by adding cancer warnings and health information to alcohol products. Meanwhile, the U.S. hasn’t updated its own alcohol warning labels in 36 years — despite the fact that we’ve learned a lot since then about alcohol and its associated health risks. Globally, only a quarter of countries require health warnings on alcohol, according to the New York Times. The U.S. is one of those countries, but labels here haven’t been updated since 1989. Currently, warning labels say that “women should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects” and that “consumption of alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to drive a car or operate machinery, and may cause health problems.” Christopher Kahler, a psychiatry professor and director of alcohol and addiction studies at Brown University, tells Yahoo Life that current labels focus on messaging intended to mitigate the acute risks from alcohol — like the immediate effects on a pregnancy or driving abilities — instead of relaying information on health consequences that can arise later on. The World Health Organization has identified alcohol as a carcinogen and says that no amount of alcohol is considered safe for our health. Yet many are unaware of the harmful health consequences of drinking that experts have been flagging for years; research shows that 51% of people don’t know that alcohol is associated with an increased risk of cancer, for example. Kahler says that in their current form, he would be “very surprised” if warning labels on alcohol were having any effect on drinking habits. “My guess is most people don't look at that label, and what they see on the label is nothing new,” he says. “And so my guess is it's having very little impact on people's behavior.” One recent study found that when young men looked at alcohol warning labels that were larger and included a picture of a young man with a bloody face, they experienced “lower activation of the reward circuits in their brains,” and the warning labels “significantly reduced their reported desire to drink.” Another study conducted in the Yukon in Canada found that adding labels to alcohol that included information on cancer risks not only reduced alcohol sales, but it also found that people who bought alcohol with the new warning labels better remembered information about national drinking guidelines and cancer risks. “These colorful, well-designed labels, which rotated across four message areas, reduced consumption in the area where the labels were introduced by 6.3% compared with control areas and the neighboring jurisdiction of the Northwest Territories,” study author Tim Stockwell, a scientist at the Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, tells Yahoo Life. “By contrast the U.S. warning labels have had hardly any effect on behavior — though they did a little for knowledge and awareness.” Cigarette warning labels and package inserts are the poster child for successfully relaying a product’s health risks, with illustrated, detailed messages such as “smoking causes head and neck cancer” and “smoking can cause heart disease and strokes by clogging arteries” and “smoking reduces blood flow, which can cause erectile dysfunction.” Suzanne Colby, deputy director of the Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies at Brown University, tells Yahoo Life that warning labels on cigarettes have effectively increased knowledge about health risks, decreased the appeal of cigarettes and increased intentions to quit smoking. While it’s less clear and less studied whether these warning labels have led to a decrease in smoking habits, she says such public health messaging could be used for alcohol as a way to get the word out that it’s harmful. “Given the massive knowledge gap for alcohol consumers, warning labels that are more specific and updated seem an ideal regulatory option since we know labels can increase knowledge — and knowledge can change norms and ultimately lead to behavior change,” Colby says. Experts emphasize that updating warning labels won’t necessarily guarantee changes in behavior, but providing more information — and making that information easier to find — can help people become better informed, which may lead to modifications in drinking habits. Here’s how alcohol warning labels could be altered to be more effective. Include more detailed, up-to-date health information. Most consumers are unaware of the disease risks — particularly the cancer risks — of even moderate drinking. Current warning labels vaguely mention that alcohol “may cause health problems,” but providing more detailed health information is critical, experts say. “I think almost everyone in my field agrees that what is more important is providing consumers with information about the potential impact [of the] product on [their] health,” Stockwell says. Make the labels more colorful and visible. Warning labels are currently on the back of alcohol bottles, tucked in with other information where they can easily be missed. “They are presently small, black-and-white, not prominently placed, wordy and haven’t changed in 35 years,” Stockwell says. “They need to be larger, colorful … they must have features which ensure they are highly visible, clear and credible.” Kahler says they could also include some kind of graphic. “It could be an icon, but something that makes it stand out from other text on the bottle that makes it more visible,” he says. Add more info on drink serving sizes. “People often don't know how much they're drinking,” Kahler says. “You can find the percent [of] alcohol somewhere on the bottle, but you often have to look. And then even once you've done that, doing the math to figure out how many drinks are in the beverage that you're having requires some calculations in the moment that make it more challenging for people to know exactly what they're putting in their body.” Kahler says people are often surprised to hear what the recommended daily limits are for alcohol consumption. Having readily available information on what constitutes one drink or serving for different types of alcohol is key. Update the labels regularly. The work shouldn’t ever really end. Periodically updating the information or look of alcohol warning labels can keep them from getting “stale” and easy to ignore. “If you see the same label every single time and it's just a little bit of words on the back, it's not something that people are going to notice,” Kahler says.",4.3k,[],2025-01-06 04:01:02,2025-01-06 19:25:23

Adam Kinzinger and the 'far left' director of 'Hot Tub Time Machine' have in common? A lot, it turns out.",,Politics,Yahoo News,4 min read,"""The Last Republican,"" a new documentary directed by Steve Pink, follows former Rep. Adam Kinzinger during his last year in Congress as one of two Republicans serving on the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol attack.",Katie MatherReporter,2025-01-03T13:00:08.000Z,"The 2010 comedy Hot Tub Time Machine, about four friends who get the chance to relive an important night in 1986, has probably not been mentioned in many documentaries — let alone a political documentary. But in The Last Republican, when former Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger is asked why he agreed to have the film’s director, Steve Pink, help produce the documentary about his career in the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, Kinzinger smiles and says, “Hot Tub Time Machine’s the thing that sold me.” Pink’s slapstick buddy comedy is not just one of Kinzinger’s favorite movies, but it serves as a sort of metaphor for the common ground between the former Republican congressman and the self-described “far left” Democratic director that is at the heart of the film. The Last Republican, which premiered in New York on Jan. 3, follows Kinzinger’s final year in Congress as one of two Republicans to serve on the House select committee investigating the Capitol attack, and the isolation he says he experienced from the rest of his party. Pink, whose other film and TV credits include High Fidelity, Accepted and the Netflix shows Santa Clarita Diet and Cobra Kai, said he was initially hesitant when one of his colleagues suggested reaching out to Kinzinger about a documentary. “I was feeling [like] a bit of a jerk about it because I’m on the far left,” Pink told Yahoo News. “I knew [Kinzinger] was courageous, but I don’t really want to do a documentary about a conservative Republican.” In the opening scene of the documentary, Kinzinger immediately addresses the political divide between himself and Pink. “You have contempt in what I believe, in terms of my political viewpoints,” Kinzinger tells Pink, who is standing off camera. “I think in any other situation, you’d probably be protesting my office.” At a time when Americans are finding it increasingly difficult to talk about politics with people who disagree with them, Pink and Kinzinger hope that The Last Republican can serve as a model for healthy civil debate. Throughout the film, the audience is given the chance to witness a number of political debates between Pink and Kinzinger, in which they are able to laugh and poke fun while calling each other names like “right-wing fascist” and “left-wing communist.” Though neither successfully convinces the other to agree with his political point of view, a genuine friendship emerges despite their differences. “What we realized — because it was something that evolved naturally, between Adam and I — is that the movie became as much about the need for civil discourse as a profile in courage,” Pink said. In the film, Kinzinger, who represented Illinois in Congress for 12 years, explains that he has always identified as a Republican, even as a young kid growing up in Florida. He was inside the Capitol on Jan. 6 when a violent mob of Donald Trump’s supporters stormed the building in an attempt to prevent the certification of Joe Biden’s 2020 electoral victory. After Jan. 6, Kinzinger was one of only 35 House Republicans who voted in favor of investigating the attack, and one of just 10 who voted to impeach Trump. He and then-Rep. Liz Cheney, of Wyoming, were the only two Republicans appointed to the select committee that investigated the attack. The film documents how Kinzinger’s decision to speak out against Trump and the events of Jan. 6 impacted his relationships with other Republicans in Congress, and the threats he and his staff received as a result. “The fact that, after that, he agreed to let us make a documentary about him, it just showed a lot of courage on his part,” Pink said. While the film is centered around one of the most contentious political moments in recent history, both Kinzinger and Pink are hopeful that the story of their friendship can encourage viewers to put politics aside and learn to bridge that divide in their own lives. “We live in a time where we’re not talking to each other, we live in different realities,” Kinzinger said. “We need this example of how to actually live together and understand each other to begin to walk us off the ledge.”",628,[],2025-01-06 04:01:02,2025-01-06 19:25:23

The ceremony has been the site of career-defining moments for some of Hollywood’s biggest stars since its inaugural year in 1944. The 82nd annual Golden Globe Awards will be no different. Hosted by actress-comedian Nikki Glaser, who is making history as the first woman to solo emcee the awards show, Hollywood’s biggest names will celebrate an incredible year in film and television at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on Jan. 5. Andrew Garfield, Catherine O’Hara, Demi Moore, Michael Keaton and Nicolas Cage are among the stars presenting during the telecast. Emilia Pérez, Netflix’s musical-thriller starring Karla Sofía Gascón, Selena Gomez and Zoe Saldaña, dominates this year’s film categories with 10 nominations, making it the most nominated movie in the musical or comedy categories in Globes history. Gascón, a first-time Golden Globe nominee, is also the first transgender woman nominated for Best Actress in a Motion Picture — Musical or Comedy. Rounding out the top nominated films are The Brutalist, with seven nominations and Conclave, which has six nominations. Leading the television nominees is FX’s The Bear, with five nominations, including Best Actor for Jeremy Allen White and Best Actress for Ayo Edebiri. Close behind are Only Murders in the Building and Shōgun, with four nominations apiece. The stars of Shōgun, Hiroyuki Sanada and Anna Sawai, are among the 26 first-time Golden Globe nominees. Also included in this year’s crop of inaugural nominees are Adam Brody, Ariana Grande, Glen Powell and Pamela Anderson. With the 2025 awards show fast approaching, here’s what to know about “Hollywood’s Party of the Year.” The 2025 Golden Globes air live from the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles on Jan. 5 at p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT. The show will broadcast live on CBS and stream on Paramount+ with Showtime. Paramount+ Essential subscribers will be able to stream the special on Jan. 6. Comedian and actress Nikki Glaser is hosting the Golden Globes for the first time. Glaser is also nominated for Best Performance in Stand-Up Comedy on Television for her HBO special, Nikki Glaser: Someday You’ll Die. “Hosting the Golden Globes is scary!” Glaser said of the gig. “It’s a well-lit room, which is not conducive to comedy; there are a lot of people I admire, which also is not conducive to comedy. It’s live, so you can’t do retakes. The level of difficulty is through the roof. And that’s thrilling to me.” Emilia Pérez nabbed the most nominations with 10, including Best Motion Picture — Musical or Comedy, Best Director for Jacques Audiard, Best Actress for Karla Sofía Gascón and Best Supporting Actress for both Zoe Saldaña and Selena Gomez. Denzel Washington scored his 11th nomination this year, making him the most-nominated Black actor in Golden Globes history. Washington is in the running for Best Actor for Gladiator II.

https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/exercising-can-be-fun--really-5-ways-to-add-more-joy-to-your-workouts-100059124.html,Exercising can be fun — really. 5 ways to add more joy to your workouts.,,Health,Yahoo Life,4 min read,"If you dread exercise, you can incorporate things like dance and play to make things more fun.",Kaitlin ReillyReporter,2025-01-03T10:00:59.000Z,"Some people get a real high from exercise: They genuinely look forward to hitting the running trail, pushing themselves in a boot camp class or trying a new pose in a yoga class. Other people mainly work out because they know it’s good for them — regular exercise plays a key role in everything from your bone and cardiovascular health to weight management and well-being. For the rest of us, though, the passion for exercise varies depending on the day: Sometimes we’re all in on a spin class, and other days we’re barely able to peel ourselves off the couch to walk around the block. No matter where you fall on the spectrum, however, there are ways you can squeeze more joy from working out. Here are five tips from experts. “Music is a game changer,” Carrie Minter Ebers, the founder of Carrie’s Pilates, tells Yahoo Life, noting that her classes include “high-energy playlists” to keep everyone motivated. At home, she recommends finding your favorite upbeat tracks, or matching the tempo of your workout to the beat, which “can make every move feel more dynamic and enjoyable.” Research has found that exercising to music may help you work out more efficiently, as well as enjoy your experience more. One way to do this is on a treadmill. TikToker Allie Bennett creates treadmill workouts with playlists of artists like Chappell Roan, Taylor Swift or even the cast of Wicked. Each song is associated with a certain tempo, which you can match as you are walking or jogging. Dalton Grant, a yoga instructor who owns the Light Orchard, a rock ’n’ roll-themed yoga studio in Los Angeles and Ojai, Calif., says that one way to find joy in exercise is to do something new. “If you usually lift weights, do hot yoga,” Grant tells Yahoo Life. “If you’re bored with HIIT training, go to a climbing wall. Stir the pot, agitate the mixture and keep it fresh. When’s the last time you did burpees for 10 minutes straight with Zeppelin cranking in the background? Just a thought!” According to a 2020 study, adding some novelty to your exercise routine can keep you more engaged. You don’t have to go for an entirely new type of workout either. If you tend to stick to the same movements while lifting weights, for example, try finding different exercises that engage the same muscles instead. Or if you take the same route for your daily walk, try out a different path. Studies have shown that working out with other people makes you more likely not only to commit to exercising, but also to enjoy it more. That’s because “working out with friends can transform exercise from a chore to something you look forward to,” Jill Drummond, a personal trainer and director of education and programming at Pilates studio Bodybar, tells Yahoo Life. “A fitness community brings motivation, accountability and most importantly fun,” she notes. “If you don’t have friends to work out with, consider joining a group like a running club or Pilates studio — they’re great at fostering a sense of community.” You likely remember the fun of recess games — and never once considered that playing tag or capture the flag was good for sneaking in some cardio. You may be more fitness-aware now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t incorporate play into your exercise routine. Studies say play is important for adults’ well-being and has great benefits for mental health, social bonding and, of course, physical fitness. “Games like double Dutch, relay races, dodgeball or sports and dance are excellent ways to stay active without feeling overwhelmed by the thought of going to the gym or following a structured workout routine,” says personal trainer Jah Washington, owner of Harlem Kettlebell Club. There are so many reasons to get out and dance, whether that’s in a class at a studio, with friends at a wedding or just alone in your bedroom. Not only can dance be a great cardio workout, but it’s also good for your brain and may even help reduce depression. And don’t stress if you’re not the world’s greatest mover and shaker — you can reap the benefits of dance no matter your skill level. “For me, movement is all about self-expression,” Keaira LaShae, founder of the dance-focused workout app If You Can Move, tells Yahoo Life. “It’s not about perfecting every move — it’s about letting the rhythm take over and having fun! Dance allows you to release stress, boost your energy and just be.”",10,[],2025-01-06 04:01:02,2025-01-06 19:26:18

""I'm mad I even know his name to be honest with you,"" she told Yahoo Entertainment.",Taryn RyderReporter,2025-01-02T23:14:23.000Z,"Golden Globes host Nikki Glaser has one request for Sunday's star-studded audience: Don't take yourselves too seriously. The comedian will be the first solo female to host the awards show, to be held on Jan. 5, and while she wants to set a light-hearted, ""celebratory"" tone with her opening monologue, Glaser says she’ll absolutely be bringing the same energy to the Globes that she brought to the Tom Brady roast back in May. ""I am doing what I was hired to do, which is, I got this because of the Tom Brady roast. That is not lost on me,"" she told Yahoo Entertainment at Thursday's Golden Globes red carpet rollout. ""So I'm going to bring that to this for sure. It's not gonna be watered down, [but] the tone will be different for this."" It's become expected for hosts to roast celebrities in the audience at the Golden Globes. Sometimes it goes over well (Ricky Gervais during his first four years) and sometimes it's clear that celebrities believe a line was crossed (Ricky Gervais in 2020.) However, Glaser doesn't think stars should fear her. ""I'm not gonna go so hard that anyone's gonna be offended,"" she said. ""I've made a point not to, and that's not to disappoint anyone who's hoping I'm going to pull a Ricky Gervais. I'm not Ricky Gervais. This isn't my last Golden Globes, this is my first one. He really went hard on his last one. He was ready to burn some bridges [because] it didn't matter anymore."" That's not to say that Glaser, who is also a Golden Globe nominee in the Best Performance in Stand-Up Comedy on Television category for HBO's Someday You'll Die, is going to ""kiss ass up there the whole time."" ""Celebrities shouldn't be nervous because it's a great opportunity for them to look cool,"" she said. ""People at home feel disconnected from celebrities. Although that's a thing we like about them that we put them on these pedestals, we're really looking for some humanity from them. And I would really encourage celebrities to just laugh at jokes about you. I know it sucks sometimes. I've been on the receiving end of jokes at roasts and I've had to laugh through my tears of being hurt. I'm not going to call you an ugly horseface woman, though, which is what I've had to laugh through."" Glaser added, ""So if I make a joke about a bad movie you did once that you had nothing to do with, other than that you were great in a bad movie, just laugh. It's a really easy way to look likable to the public and actually it's a great PR move. Everyone in your camp should encourage you to laugh at jokes. It doesn't make you cooler to not laugh. ... I'm trying to make you look good. I really am not out to hurt anyone's career."" When asked if anything is off-limits, Glaser said she has no interest in wading into the It Ends With Us drama. ""I think the Blake Lively-Justin Baldoni thing is such a hot-button thing right now that even a mere mention of it will seem like I could be on the wrong side of things, even though I would never be,"" she said. ""I also don't want to give his name any — I'm mad I even know his name, to be honest with you, so I don't need to say it anymore."" As for whether she'll get political, Glaser said ""people are just tired of hearing about it, even though it's looming and it's in the air."" ""There will be a nod to it, but it will not be too heavy-handed. I've made a good point not to go too hard,"" she said. Overall, Glaser wants to put the audience at ease. ""I think a lot of times we can project our own nerves onto the hosts that we haven't seen before. Like, 'Are they gonna be OK? Oh my God, I would be so nervous. Is she stumbling?' I just want to walk out there and make everyone feel like we're in good hands because the host really does set the tone for the whole evening,"" she said. ""The tone is celebratory, but also, let's laugh about how ridiculous this is with the state of the world that we're all dressed up and giving out awards for playing pretend. We have to acknowledge that that's silly, even though it is amazing."" For anyone wondering, no, there is nothing Glaser is told not to say by the Golden Globes. President Helen Hoehne told Yahoo Entertainment that the comedian has free rein. ""She can say whatever she wants. We have no control over it,"" Hoehne said. ""[Nikki] doesn't run anything by us. I don't even get to hear anything ahead of the show, it's really all up to her.""

How she’s dealt with criticism while growing up in the public eye.",,Celebrity,Yahoo Life,5 min read,The 20-year-old actress is reminding people that she's grown up.,Kerry JustichReporter,2025-01-02T22:39:12.000Z,"Millie Bobby Brown isn’t Eleven anymore. The actress, who has starred in Stranger Things since she was 12, had to remind followers that she’s growing up. On Monday, Brown shared a series of mirror selfies to Instagram. She captioned the post “me and my mini,” referring to her tiny Louis Vuitton x Murakami tote. Trolls descended and blew up her comments section with body- and age-shaming remarks. “MILLIE WHAT HAPPENED,” one person wrote on the post, while another commented, “Millie’s google history : ‘How to look 65 when you are 16,’” insinuating that Brown looks beyond her age. Others joined the chorus, saying Brown looks “way older” than she is. “She skipped 20s & went straight to 40’s,” one wrote. Some accused the actress of wearing too much makeup, getting plastic surgery and even threw in accusations that she might be pregnant. Her response was shared to Instagram Stories on Tuesday. It was a simple, direct message: “women grow!! not sorry about it :).” As a child star, now a married adult who is a successful author and business owner, it’s a sentiment she’s repeated, time and time again, those who’ve watched her get older in front of the camera — and can’t seem to accept who she is now. Before Stranger Things, which debuted in 2016 and will air its final season at some point this year, Brown appeared on hit shows like Grey’s Anatomy and NCIS. As she revealed to Harper’s Bazaar, even as she was featured in supporting roles, she was subjected to cyberbullying. Once Stranger Things became a blockbuster hit, and while Brown was just a teenager, appearance critiques became a near-constant companion as she navigated Hollywood. “It’s always difficult to dress for a red carpet event because a lot of people have opinions and unfortunately you say you won’t listen to it, but you actually kind of have to,” she told the publication. By 16, she was using her voice to call out her abnormal experience and plead for people to do better. In an Instagram post on her birthday, she shared a video featuring nasty headlines about her, followed by clips showing her being followed by paparazzi and fans. “Our world needs kindness and support in order for us children to grow and succeed,” she captioned the post. “The last few years haven't been easy, I'll admit that. There are moments I get frustrated from the inaccuracy, inappropriate comments, sexualization, and unnecessary insults that ultimately have resulted in pain and insecurity for me. But not ever will I be defeated. I'll continue doing what I love and spreading the message in order to make change.” Brown was still pleading with the public at 17 to see her as the woman she was becoming. “So being a young girl, people watch you grow up, right? And they've almost become invested in your growth and your journey. But they aren't ready to accept the fact that you're growing up,” she said during an interview with MTV News. “So I wear a crop top and people are like, 'She's 10.' I'm like, 'No…I am 17.' That's a thing that girls do. Or I wear high heels. Or I wear an outfit to an award show and they're like, 'She looks 50.'” Becoming an adult was another moment that stands out, according to Brown. While people were long inappropriately commenting on her body — in one instance mentioning her cleavage on a red carpet when she was just 15 — there was a marked influx of “gross” commentary once she turned 18 that was overwhelming. In a 2022 interview with Allure, Brown also shared how confusing it was to mature with online critics always weighing in on her every move. ""It's really hard to be hated on when you don’t know who you are yet,"" she said. ""So it's like, 'What do they hate about me? 'Cause I don’t know who I am.' It's almost like, 'OK, I'm going to try being this today.' [And then they say], 'Oh, no, I hate that.' 'OK. Forget that. I'm going to try being this today.' 'Oh, my God! I hate when you do that.' Then you just start shutting down because you’re like, 'Who am I meant to be? Who do they need me to be for them?'"" Ultimately, she’s seemed to find purpose in these experiences. “Young women are dragged down for many different things. If it’s our maturity, if it’s the way we dress, if it’s the things we say, if it’s the choices we make, we will never be enough,” she told Netflix's online magazine Queue. “It’s for us to find camaraderie and sisterhood in that. And to stand together and say, ‘We are enough.’ We have to stick together, breaking those stereotypes and standards.” Brown’s short response to trolls this week is an example of that — and already it has brought some people together in the comment section of her latest Instagram post: a video reflecting on her 2024. “Women do grow and you don’t need to apologize to anyone for it!” and “You've grown into such a beautiful woman!!” read a couple of the comments. Another: “A celebrity to everyone, a regular young woman living her life with her husband and family. I love this.”",1.6k,[],2025-01-06 04:01:02,2025-01-06 19:26:18

Here are the main allegations.",Suzy ByrneReporter,2025-01-02T21:54:03.000Z,"We imagine Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni didn’t have legal battles on their 2025 vision boards, but here we are. As the year ended, the It Ends With Us co-stars traded allegations of workplace misconduct while making the film, which Baldoni also directed and was a 2024 box office hit. There have been three separate legal filings over this in less than two weeks: On Dec. 20, Lively filed a sexual harassment complaint against Baldoni and his Wayfarer Studios with the California Civil Rights Department. Baldoni, who has denied Lively’s “false and destructive” claims, including that he waged a smear PR campaign against her, sued the New York Times for libel over the actress’s allegations in Los Angeles Superior Court on Dec. 31. The same day, Lively sued Baldoni for retaliation for her harassment claims in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Within these hundreds of pages of legal documents — including text messages between each other and with various publicists and other players in this Hollywood saga — have been a flurry of bombshell accusations back and forth. We break down the biggest allegations. The film began production in June 2023 and was released in August 2024. In Lively’s complaint and lawsuit, the actress and producer claimed Baldoni — her love interest in the film, an adaptation of the Colleen Hoover novel — allegedly improvised “physical intimacy that had not been rehearsed, choreographed, or discussed with [her].” She said he tried to add a graphic sex scene without her consent, which would have her character have an orgasm on camera. She said Baldoni talked about his sex life with his wife and asked her personal details about her relationship with husband Ryan Reynolds. She said Baldoni and Wayfarer producer Jamey Heath pressured her to simulate full nudity for a birth scene “despite no mention of nudity for this scene in the script, her contract, or in previous creative discussions.” Lively said Baldoni and Heath told her they had “previous porn addictions.” Lively said Heath showed her and her assistant a video of his fully nude wife giving birth. She also alleged that they entered her hair and makeup trailer unannounced multiple times, including when she was getting dressed and breastfeeding. Baldoni categorically denied the accusations through his attorney Bryan Freedman, who has said the claims are “completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious” and her complaint was to “fix her negative reputation.” Baldoni said that Lively saying she was shown “pornographic” videos, when it was footage of someone’s wife giving birth while they were discussing a birth scene, is an “outrageous” distortion. Baldoni claimed Lively “refused” to meet with the intimacy coordinator to plan out the film’s sex scenes and that he took the meeting alone. Baldoni shared texts in his filing in which Lively invited him to her trailer to work on lines while she was pumping. In Lively’s complaint, she accused Baldoni and Wayfarer of embarking on a “multi-tiered plan” to damage her reputation after she called a meeting during production, also attended by Reynolds, to address what she described as “repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior.” She claimed a crisis PR team planted theories online that were critical of her to “bury” and “destroy” her reputation. Lively’s attorneys have since said she was subjected to “further retaliation and attacks” after she went public with the misconduct allegations against Baldoni, detailed in a Dec. 21 New York Times story titled “'We Can Bury Anyone’: Inside a Hollywood Smear Machine,” which is why she’s suing him — as well as his crisis manager Melissa Nathan and publicist Jennifer Abel — in federal court. Baldoni denied there was a PR campaign against Lively, providing additional text messages he claimed the New York Times omitted showing that he and his publicist didn’t want to or try to smear Lively. In his lawsuit, Baldoni said the New York Times article “relied almost entirely on Lively’s unverified and self-serving narrative, lifting it nearly verbatim while disregarding an abundance of evidence that contradicted her claims and exposed her true motives.” The actress, who gave birth to her fourth child in February 2023, said Baldoni “routinely” criticized and questioned “her body and weight.” She claimed he called her “fitness trainer, without her knowledge or permission, and implied that he wanted her to lose weight.” She also claimed that when she was diagnosed with strep throat, Baldoni sent her to an expert to help her combat the sickness, but she found out the person was a weight loss expert. Baldoni denied this, saying in his lawsuit that he has “back issues and has multiple bulging discs” and was worried about picking up Lively in a scene. No such scene existed, Lively's lawsuit countered. He claimed Reynolds confronted him and “aggressively berated” him for “fat-shaming” Lively during a meeting at Lively and Reynolds’s New York City penthouse. He claimed Reynolds was “so aggressive” that he felt “compelled to offer repeated apologies, despite his question being entirely reasonable and made in good faith.” Baldoni claimed that the “inappropriate and humiliating” verbal attack took place “perhaps intentionally, as other celebrity friends were coming in and out of” the couple’s penthouse. Baldoni said a producer on the movie, who was at the meeting, allegedly told him “that in his 40-year career he had never seen anyone speak to someone like that” — referring to the way Reynolds allegedly spoke to Baldoni. While he was the director, he claimed Lively made a “calculated and audacious attempt to seize control of the Film.” After Lively called for the meeting during production to express her grievances against him, Baldoni said she allegedly insisted on joining him in the editing bay, during a period in which he said a director typically has sole access to the film. He said Lively eventually fired his film editors and replaced them with her own, including one favored by Reynolds, and shut Baldoni out of the process completely. In his lawsuit, Baldoni included a text he sent at the time that said, “She’s kicked me out officially from the film now. She’s finishing it all. I can’t be involved. Music sound VFX everything. I’ll make it through somehow.” Baldoni said in his lawsuit that he “grew increasingly fearful of what Lively and Reynolds were capable of” as a Hollywood power pair and claimed that Reynolds personally pressured his then-agent to drop him at the Deadpool & Wolverine premiere in July. Reynolds, Lively and Baldoni had all been repped by WME at the time. WME — which has since dropped Baldoni, one day after Lively filed her complaint — denied Baldoni’s claim in a statement, saying, “This is not true. Baldoni’s former representative was not at the Deadpool & Wolverine premiere nor was there any pressure from Reynolds or Lively at any time to drop Baldoni as a client.” Baldoni’s lawsuit said that not only “had Lively stolen the Film” by using editors she selected, but she also robbed Baldoni and his team of any genuine opportunity to celebrate their hard work” at the August premiere. It claimed that “further undermining Baldoni’s role,” Lively “initially refused to permit his attendance at the … premiere.” It was “only after significant pressure did she reluctantly agree to allow Baldoni and the Wayfarer team to attend,” but he claimed it was “under humiliating conditions.” While Reynolds, Lively and her co-stars Jenny Slate and Brandon Sklenar were front and center, Baldoni and the Wayfarer team and their families “were segregated from the main cast, barred from the exclusive after-party, and forced to organize their own event at additional cost.” He said his participation on the red carpet was “cut short” and “his family and friends were confined to a makeshift holding area in the basement before being escorted into a separate theater after Lively’s departure.” The way it played out made it clear to the press that something was amiss behind the scenes of the film. After Baldoni filed his lawsuit, Lively’s attorney said in a statement, “Nothing in this lawsuit changes anything about the claims advanced in Ms. Lively’s California Civil Rights Department Complaint, nor her federal complaint... This lawsuit is based on the obviously false premise that Ms. Lively’s administrative complaint against Wayfarer and others was a ruse based on a choice ‘not to file a lawsuit against Baldoni, Wayfarer,’ and that ‘litigation was never her ultimate goal.’ As demonstrated by the federal complaint filed by Ms. Lively earlier today, that frame of reference for the Wayfarer lawsuit is false. While we will not litigate this matter in the press, we do encourage people to read Ms. Lively’s complaint in its entirety. We look forward to addressing each and every one of Wayfarer’s allegations in court.”",73,[],2025-01-06 04:01:02,2025-01-06 19:26:18

At a Friday press conference in Las Vegas, police confirmed the identity of the driver of a rented Tesla Cybertruck that exploded on New Year’s Day outside of the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas as Matthew Alan Livelsberger. A former Green Beret, Livelsberger took his own life at the scene, according to police. Shamsud-Din Jabbar, another U.S. citizen and former Army veteran was killed by police in New Orleans after driving a truck into a crowd of people the same day in an apparent act of terrorism inspired by ISIS, killing at least 14 and injuring dozens. “Just to be clear, there is no evidence that these two events are connected.” FBI special agent Spencer Evans said at Friday’s press conference in Las Vegas. “The only things that we have connecting them are incidental, what we believe to be coincidental similarities in that both vehicles were rented through the same service, that both subjects served in the military, that they both stayed in an Airbnb, things like that.” Evans added that there was no record of phone communication between the two men, nor evidence to suggest they had known one another. Police discovered two cellphones — one of which they were able to access — belonging to Livelsberger, Assistant Sheriff Dory Corin told reporters. Entries found in the phone's Notes app contained messages believed to be written by the suspect. “This was not a terrorist attack, it was a wake up call,” one message read. “Americans only pay attention to spectacles and violence. What better way to get my point across than a stunt with fireworks and explosives? Why did I personally do it now? I needed to cleanse my mind of the brothers I’ve lost and relieve myself of the burden of the lives I took.” Livelsberger served five combat tours, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Kevin McMahill said, noting that he likely suffered from PTSD. McMahill added that the evidence that police had found so far suggests he had no negative feelings about President-elect Donald Trump, despite the site of the explosion and the vehicle used. On Thursday, McMahill said that officials who searched the truck had recovered a military identification and passport belonging to Livelsberger, as well as an iPhone, smartwatch, multiple firearms and fireworks. The FBI searched a Colorado Springs, Colo., residence Wednesday night associated with Livelsberger, Denver 7 News reported. Agents with the Denver Field Division of the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the Colorado Springs Police Department assisted in the search of the property. The FBI is investigating whether the incident was an act of terrorism and whether there is any connection between Livelsberger, a former U.S. Army Green Beret, and Shamsud-Din Jabbar, another U.S. citizen and former Army veteran who drove a truck into a crowd of people in New Orleans the same day, killing at least 14 and insuring dozens. DNA evidence provided by Livelsberger's family confirmed that the body found in the burned out Cybertruck was his, McMahill said Friday. Here’s what we know about Livelsberger and the attack so far. Livelsberger rented a Tesla Cybertruck in Colorado using the Turo app and drove it to Las Vegas, stopping along the way to charge the vehicle, according to McMahill. At 8:40 a.m. local time on New Year’s Day, he detonated the vehicle, which was packed with firework mortars and camp fuel canisters. It was initially reported that Livelsberger died in the explosion, which also resulted in what have been described as minor injuries to seven other people. However, McMahill said Thursday that the body found inside the vehicle had sustained a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head just before the truck was detonated. On Friday, McMahill said police were still investigating the exact timing of the explosion and Livelsberger's self-inflicted gunshot wound. Livelsberger, 37, was a married U.S. Army veteran who, according to his LinkedIn profile, had spent 18 years with the Special Forces. He joined the Green Berets as a communications specialist in 2006. In 2012, he resumed active duty, joining the U.S. Army Special Operations, Axios reported, and was on approved leave when he died. During his military career, Livelsberger served tours in Afghanistan, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Georgia and Congo, the U.S. Army confirmed to the Associated Press. He was also a highly decorated soldier, awarded two Bronze Stars, a combat infantry badge and an Army Commendation Medal with valor. Both Livelsberger, 37, and Jabbar, 42, were stationed at the North Carolina military base formerly known as Fort Bragg, where some Army special operations units are trained. A military official who spoke with the Associated Press said there had been no overlap in the assignments of the two men at the base. Jabbar, who said in a video that he had joined ISIS last summer, served in the U.S. Army from 2006 to 2015, and in the Army Reserve from 2015 to 2020, Defense Department officials told NBC News. Like Livelsberger, Jabar served in Afghanistan during the U.S. troop surge there in 2009. And like Livelsberger, Jabbar also used the Turo app to rent the Ford F-150 pickup truck that he drove from Houston to New Orleans. “We do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat,” a spokesperson for Turo said in a statement. Both trucks contained explosive materials, though Jabbar, according to the FBI, had planted two improvised explosive devices in coolers: one that was found at the intersection of Bourbon and Orleans streets and one at another intersection about two blocks away from where he rammed his truck into bystanders.",6k,[],2025-01-06 04:01:02,2025-01-06 19:26:18

First, there's the crunchy, chewy support system, aka the bread. Then you have the egg, the humble centerpiece of this timeless tableau that can be taken to myriad delicious places, depending on what you add. Some use bacon, sausage or ham; others opt for cheese — or both. And don't even get me started on the hot sauce. The breakfast sandwich is a gift we give to ourselves, best eaten toasty and made with love. However, whipping up a masterpiece takes time, which is why breakfast sandwiches are often created and consumed on weekends or away from home — unless you have the top-selling Hamilton Beach Breakfast Sandwich Maker, which I discovered at Amazon one fortuitous morning. And now, another wonderful discovery: The Hamilton Beach Dual Breakfast Sandwich Maker, which is on rare sale at Amazon so you can double your eggy, meaty, cheesy satisfaction. More than 20,000 have been purchased in the past month alone! Amazon Just add ingredients to each nonstick pan, close the device, wait about five minutes and remove the layers to stack the sandwiches. Breakfast for two is served! A McDonald's Sausage Egg McMuffin will cost you about $4, depending on where you live. That's not a lot, but you have to get dressed, get in the car, drive over and wait in line — and that takes time. Instead, you could skip all that and make a breakfast sandwich at home while your coffee brews. Surely all that convenience and saved time is worth $33. It's within a few bucks of its best price all year (it was down to $30 for Prime Day), so our advice? Strike while the iron is hot! I tested out the individual sandwich maker, and it did not disappoint. The contraption features layers of hot plates stacked on top of each other — essentially mini pans designed to perfectly cook each individual component. Plus, there's a handy timer that lets you know when the goods are done, so it's basically foolproof. It's a snap to use: Add ingredients to each pan and close the device. The pans are removable, so when time is up (usually five minutes), simply remove them and stack up the piping-hot goodness. I was skeptical at first. After all, I was used to spending a lot of time crafting breakfast sandwiches. But after using this device once, I was hooked. It pristinely cooked every element of the sandwich — even the egg! The ham was smoky and warm, the cheese was perfectly melted and the egg was the ideal level of gooeyness. Plus, my English muffin didn’t get soggy (I figured it would, given that I put one on top of the egg). After using the appliance for more than a year, I can honestly say it works just as well now as it did at the beginning. It saves me so much time in the mornings and makes the perfect meal to keep me fueled and energized all day. Plus, washing it is super easy too. Just put the nonstick pans in the dishwasher or hand-wash 'em. And need we point out that kids will love the double sandwich maker as much as the grownups? More than 19,000 Amazon reviewers have given this a.m. hunger-slayer five out of five stars. ""Trust me when I say, it's a game-changer for breakfast lovers everywhere,"" raved one happy home cook. ""Not only is it super easy to use (just pop in your ingredients, close the lid and voila!), but it's also incredibly easy to clean. No more messy stovetops or multiple pans needed — just one compact device that does it all."" ""I was looking for a simple way to prepare a great breakfast sandwich that wasn't frozen; this was the answer,"" shared another. ""I originally bought the one-sandwich option but quickly realized the two-sandwich option was the way to go because everyone in our family loves to make them. I have found countless recipes online that give me new and creative ideas for sandwich options."" Another shopper explained how easy it is to use on busy mornings: ""My husband loves making breakfast sandwiches every morning before work. It takes three and a half minutes before it's done, so he makes his coffee and then enjoys them to take on the go, together."" Nonetheless, one four-star fan warned that once the device is plugged in, it's on: ""Easy to clean, easy to use, my only gripe is that the power is controlled by plugging in and unplugging. Should be a power button for it."" ""The one thing I do wish [is] that you could simply pour egg whites from a carton into this,"" shared a final reviewer. ""It spills out. But hey, that issue is minimal."" Amazon You can also use this device to make grilled cheese and other hot sandwiches in a flash. Not a fan of breakfast sandwiches? How about this nifty device for making a fast-casual favorite at home? Amazon You can make all kinds of eggs with this little cooker! It can make sous vide egg bites (just like Starbucks!) as well as custards, mini cheesecakes and more. If you have Amazon Prime, you’ll get free shipping, of course. Not yet a member? No problem. You can sign up for your free 30-day trial here. (And by the way, those without Prime still get free shipping on orders of $35 or more.)

""I've long been a Sonicare user, and I'm excited about this travel-friendly version, complete with a sleek case."" It also happens to be on sale at Amazon right now. Amazon Take your brushing experience to the next level with micro-vibrations that clean and polish your teeth better than regular ol' scrubbing. When Oprah says she approves of something, we listen. And while we might not always have the budget to afford her more luxurious faves, she's been known to make some budget-friendly gift picks too — $17 for a brand-name battery-operated toothbrush we'll use multiple times a day seems pretty doable. Using an electric toothbrush is typically far more effective than manual brushing, and this model uses micro-vibrations and gentle nylon tapered bristles to polish teeth and remove plaque. A two-minute timer with 30-second notifications allows you to brush those pearly whites for the appropriate amount of time, while the three-month battery life means you won't have to replace the battery very often (it comes with one too, so you can start using it out of the box!). It's also super portable and comes with a compact travel case, ideal for stowing safely as you move from one family gathering to the next this holiday season. And can we talk about those gorgeous color options? There's light blue, navy, coral and yellow for anyone who likes a bright pop, but neutrals like black and white are available in rechargeable models as well. Oprah isn't the only enthusiast — this travel-ready toothbrush has more than 12,000 five-star ratings from Amazon customers to back it up. One five-star reviewer said it's simply the best: ""This Sonic Electric Toothbrush far exceeded my expectations,"" they wrote. ""The size is great because it fits my toothbrush holder. This is so terrific that I purchased two. ... Do not hesitate to buy this one."" Reviewers also rave about how great this is for travel. ""I love how compact this toothbrush is. I have a regular Sonicare that I use at home. I have taken that one on trips, but as much as I loved it ... it took up too much space. This one is compact, light and fits perfectly into my overnight bag,"" one jet-setter shared. ""Buy it — you will not regret it."" ""My dental hygienist has been hounding me to get an electric toothbrush, so I got this one,"" explained a final fan. ""Two weeks after getting it, I left for Iceland. I loved how easy it was to pack this up and take it with me and to be able to travel without disrupting my normal teeth-cleaning routine. I also like that it takes a standard AAA battery rather than some obscure battery size. ... I've had it for almost three months now ... and I have yet to change the battery."" ""I love my electronic toothbrush at home, but it's not ideal for travel. Was looking for something to use for travel and I think this is as close to perfect as I can get,"" said one shopper, adding as their lone criticism, ""The only reason I gave it four stars is because the bristles are a little tougher than what I thought they would be."" The final five-star reviewer from above offered this slight criticism: ""I do wish the timer was adjustable, as I feel like I need another 30 seconds to finish cleaning my mouth, so sometimes I let it go for another partial round.""

The franchise’s second feature-length film, from directors Nick Park and Merlin Crossingham, comes nearly 20 years after its first, the Oscar-winning Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. The new film, which begins streaming Jan. 3 on Netflix, tackles a subject that’s been playing out even beyond the big screen. What happens when technology gets out of control? And who’s behind it? “The idea of Wallace inventing a smart gnome was kind of bubbling away many years ago, back on Curse of the Were-Rabbit,” Park told Yahoo Entertainment. However, it was an idea for a 30-minute film, not a feature. The co-director said that the idea “seemed to lack something, like a more sinister element” that’s always played a role in the Wallace & Gromit films. “What's motivating the gnomes? Who's motivating [them]?” he asked, saying that it couldn’t just be the inventions just going wrong. “You need something a bit more personal.” That personal element comes in the form of a fan-favorite franchise villain — Feathers McGraw, a clever penguin who first appeared in the 1993 short film Wallace & Gromit: The Wrong Trousers and who uses a signature red rubber glove to disguise himself as a chicken. When the creators settled on Feathers McGraw, who wasn’t originally intended to be in the film, they knew the story “had a lot more legs.” “It became Cape Fear with penguins all of a sudden,” Park said, referring to the thriller about a released prisoner who’s out for revenge. “The themes of the story started to really blossom about not just technology and the relationship that we have with it, but also who's controlling it,” Crossingham added. As Gromit becomes more concerned with his inventor friend Wallace’s growing dependence on his new tech creation, the film asks whether technology enhances relationships or diminishes them in ways we’re not aware of. “We’re definitely not saying tech is bad, not at all,” Crossingham said. “‘Cause we love tech as much as the next person, but it's just asking the question about that balance.” The film has since been nominated for a Golden Globe in the Best Motion Picture — Animated category. Park and Crossingham were sitting down to a goodbye lunch with some of the Vengeance Most Fowl crew when they learned the news. “We just had some champagne poured” when the nominations were announced on Dec. 9, Crossingham said. ""and so it was a fortuitous moment. We raised a glass.” “It’s just amazing to be nominated,” Park added. “You don't make these things for awards, really. Just being nominated is an accolade in itself and a reward for all those incredible craftspeople and artists that worked on the movie.” More than 200 crew members worked on the film, which took about five years to complete. With each animator producing 4.2 seconds of animation per week on average, 30 animators produced about 127 seconds of animation weekly during peak production time, ultimately creating a 79-minute feature film. So what gets left out in the process, especially in the case of such a beloved franchise? Park and Crossingham said they didn’t want to be “too gross” or “too dark” and definitely decided not to include swearing. “We're trying to maintain their innocence without them being cutesy innocent,” Crossingham said. Park called their work “gentle humor that’s observational.” “Wallace is very well-meaning. He's not got an agenda. He's not trying to be nasty. It's just his faults make him, and Gromit have that friction in their relationship,” Crossingham said. “It's kind of mild-mannered. He's mild-mannered. He's not in-your-face,” Park added. When the film debuted at Hollywood’s AFI Fest in October, audiences cheered when Feathers McGraw appeared onscreen. So would the filmmakers consider a spinoff featuring the popular villain? “I think if the good idea falls out of the sky into our lap, then why not?” Crossingham said. “Otherwise not. He needs to remain special.” Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl starts streaming Jan. 3 on Netflix.",12,[],2025-01-06 04:01:02,2025-01-06 19:26:18

You might think that you alone have figured out the way to effectively juggle multiple tasks at once. Unfortunately, you’re probably falling into a trap: Studies show our perceived ability to multitask is far greater than our actual ability to multitask. “According to research, only 2.5% of people can multitask successfully,” says time management strategist Kelly Nolan. “So there’s a 97.5% chance you, the person reading this, cannot multitask without a decrease in your performance on the tasks.” Indeed, the cold hard facts say that multitasking is not doing the vast majority of us any favors. So when is multitasking working against us and not making us ultra-efficient little worker bees? And what can we do about it in a work culture that prides itself on productivity? Here's what experts say. “Multitasking is less effective than solo-tasking,” licensed psychologist Jenna Brownfield tells Yahoo Life. “You can still get things done and be effective when multitasking, but it usually comes at the cost of tasks taking more time or having more errors.” Studies back that up — and show exactly why this happens. Our brains are, quite literally, not designed to do two things simultaneously. When we attempt to do so anyway, it requires more neural processing to switch from task to task, which slows both tasks down. “​​The tricky thing is how it feels isn’t always accurate,” says productivity expert Grace Marshall. “We can feel like we’re working faster or getting loads done when multitasking because it feels busy; we’re stimulated when we’re switching tasks. But in reality, it takes more time [and] more cognitive energy, and we’re more likely to lose the thread or make mistakes.” Studies also indicate that multitasking can leave people feeling higher levels of anxiety, depression and chronic stress. “A common dynamic I see is that multitasking leaves you feeling anxious and your mind feeling scattered,” says Brownfield. “You are less focused and less productive with the tasks at hand. When someone does solo-tasking, they focus more in-depth with a single task. They often end up being more efficient and less anxious.” Many among us, however, might know that multitasking isn’t the ticket but insist upon doing it anyway. “Some people find multitasking to be more stimulating than solo-tasking,” says Brownfield, adding that those people must be “willing to accept the pitfalls of multitasking for the sake of a more engaging work time.” “Multitasking can be fun for some people precisely because you’re distracting yourself,” adds Marshall. “For example, listening to a podcast or chatting to a friend when I’m running takes my mind off the fact that my legs hurt! But I’m intentionally taking attention away from one thing onto another.” If you’re paying close attention, you might see your body and mind waving the flag that the attempts at multitasking are not working. A big telltale sign is that you begin making mistakes — not because you don’t know something but because you’re moving too fast. There are also often physical components to look for. “Your thoughts may begin moving at a faster tempo or your body feels restless,” notes Brownfield. If that sounds familiar, perhaps it’s time to give solo-tasking a go. “Brief breaks to refocus and center yourself can go a long way,” says Brownfield. “Taking even 10 minutes to step away from the tasks, take some deep breaths and then come back to it helps.” All that said, there are times when multitasking is totally unavoidable — which is probably no surprise to any parents or caregivers. “I personally use timers on Alexa in my kitchen often,” shares Nolan. “If my 3-year-old needs me while I'm cooking her dinner, I'll set a two-minute timer to remind myself to come back to the stove when that thing should be stirred. Don't expect your brain to do both tasks (cooking and kid-caring) well at the same time. Help yourself out.” But if, and when, you can: Try to avoid multitasking. “It's useful not to confuse multitasking with having multiple commitments, projects or roles to fulfill,” says Marshall. “It’s a bit like traffic control. In order to focus on moving one thing across, something else needs to be on hold. We work better when we can strategically switch focus between these things — and have time when we step back and review the overall picture — rather than trying to pay attention to everything at once.”",13,[],2025-01-06 04:01:02,2025-01-06 19:26:18

For a machine with that kind of hunger, we turn to Shark. And right now, you can score the mega-popular Shark Navigator Lift-Away Deluxe Swivel Vacuum for just $149, down from $220 — a squeaky-clean 32% off. Amazon Thousands of reviewers agree: the Shark Navigator Lift-Away Deluxe Swivel Vacuum makes cleaning a breeze. High-end vacs — with some models costing upwards of $500 or more — don't come cheap. The Shark Navigator Lift-Away Deluxe is a fan-favorite, and you can snap it up now for your New Year's clean for over 30% off. The Shark Navigator Lift-Away Deluxe packs a lot of power (100K+ volts) into one lightweight (16 lbs.), easy-to-maneuver frame. The swivel functionality is great for zipping around furniture, and the detachable upper portion lifts away (hence the name) for accessing areas that are hard to reach. It also boasts a built-in HEPA filter and what’s called Anti-Allergen Complete Seal Technology for zapping dust mites, dander and other troublemakers in one fell swoop. And, as mentioned above, the Shark Navigator Lift-Away Deluxe comes with several attachments, including an upholstery tool for tackling finer hair and stubborn pet fur — along with a detachable, large-capacity dust cup for making the most of your clean. Nearly 79,000 Amazon shoppers rave about this super-sucker. “This is by far the lightest vacuum we've ever owned and THE quietest,” wrote one fan. “It's easy to have a normal conversation while this is running. It's powerful. Now, the cons: The collection bin is small. The head width is small. If you have a lot of carpet to clean, it'll take more passes and more stops to empty the bin. Worth it? ABSOLUTELY!!!” “Very powerful,” a rave reviewer gushed. “I have 3 Pomeranians, so needless to say I NEED a vacuum cleaner for daily use. I had vacuumed already when it arrived but I wanted to just run it over the rug just a quick test. Well let’s just say after 2 passes and seeing how much my old vacuum didn’t get, I ended up vacuuming the whole house!!! I was shocked at how much I vacuumed up! I also didn’t smell dog blowing out of it as I vacuumed either. This is a no-brainer…buy it!” “This Shark outperforms our Dyson by a mile,” raved a five-star fan. “It's easy to maneuver and is lightweight. It has clogged once, but I've yet to see a vacuum that doesn't. Our bulldog sheds like crazy and this thing has no problem getting it out of the carpet.” ""This is a great product,"" shared one shopper. ""A wider base would be nice to increase coverage. The plastic is a bit flimsy but that is the only weakness."" Another shopper wrote: ""It doesn’t like the smaller 5x8s or 5x3s or oriental-type area rugs. Not sure if it’s because of the awesome suction or if it’s because it only has one roller on the bottom.""

After the holiday hubbub and sluggishness of Twixmas, it’s time to snap back into work mode — and get cracking on any resolutions you might have set for yourself. But you don’t need a big “new year, new you” overhaul to get this year off to a healthier start. Small actions — like the ones outlined below — can make a big difference, whether that’s squeezing short “exercise snacks” into your day, starting your morning with a hearty, warming bowl of oatmeal or making a point of going outside (minus your phone!) on your lunch break. 🤢 Hit up these hangover cures. Go too hard on the New Year’s Eve bubbly? If you’re feeling rough this morning, drinking water, eating carbs and popping an aspirin or ibuprofen (but not a Tylenol, which can exacerbate the alcohol’s effects on your liver) may put you on the path to recovery. There’s one hangover cure you can skip, however: the “hair of the dog.” Experts say having another drink may make you temporarily feel better but also prolongs the amount of time it takes to bounce back from the booze. 🤞 Eat for good luck. Various cultures ring in the New Year with special dishes, from pomegranate seeds to grapes. Does it work? Who knows? Should you try them anyway? Why not? In the U.S., black-eyed peas are a firm favorite, and they’re healthy to boot. The nutrient-dense beans are packed with protein, fiber and good-for-you polyphenols. Serve ‘em up with collard greens (high in fiber, vitamins A, C and K, folate and more) and cornbread (contains phosphorus and B vitamins, but watch out for sodium), which are also associated with good luck. Or mix it up and whip up a nontraditional take, such as Carla Hall’s black-eyed pea salad. 🧊 Consider a polar bear plunge. From Austin, Texas, to the Jersey Shore, New Year’s Day means swapping your sweater for a swimsuit and taking an ice-cold dip. Fans of the tradition say it’s a great way to jolt yourself into a new year mindset (and make you forget about that hangover you woke up with). While evidence is limited, health experts say a cold plunge could help lower inflammation, provide pain relief, ease stress and awaken the senses — provided it’s done safely. 🩸 Find out your blood type — and consider donating. January is National Blood Donor Month, and it’s worth remembering that donating blood (for those who are able) is good for you, too. And while people with the blood type O negative are known as universal donors, because their red blood cells can be used on anyone in an emergency, it’s definitely worth donating regardless of your blood type, as the preference is to have matching blood types. Don’t know your blood type? Here are a few ways to find it, including consulting your parents, taking an at-home test or checking your records after making a blood donation (yet another reason to roll up your sleeves). 🍷 Bring on Dry (or Damp?) January. If your 2025 agenda involves cutting back on the booze, experts recommend enlisting the help of a like-minded friend who can keep you on track and making note of any benefits you enjoy from not drinking (like better sleep or fewer “What did I say last night?!” panics). This might also be time to experiment with some fun mocktails — try these dietitian-approved tips — but be careful not to overdo it if you’re swapping soda for alcohol. 🗄️ Tidy up. Yes, there is an official Clear Off Your Desk Day, and guess what? It’s Jan. 13 this year, so go ahead and set a reminder. It’s time to file away the papers you need, shred the stuff you don’t and toss any old Post-it notes, empty coffee cups, takeout cutlery and other detritus cluttering your work space. Research says a clean workspace improves focus and productivity; conversely, one study found that people with messy desks were perceived as more neurotic, less agreeable and less conscientious. 😔 Remember that Blue Monday isn’t real. If you go into January bracing yourself for the most depressing day of the year, aka Blue Monday, you can stop. As the Guardian has reported, the “holiday” (which this year would fall on Monday, Jan. 20), was conceived to help a U.K. travel firm sell more vacations to people looking to ward off their winter blues, and the psychologist behind the concept has since discredited it. While there’s no reason to fear this one particular day, some people (about 5% of U.S. adults) may experience seasonal affective disorder this time of year. If you’re experiencing symptoms (low energy, changes to eating and sleeping habits) that seem more persistent or life-altering than a standard seasonal slump, raise it with your doctor. 🧑‍⚕️ Stay on top of your cervical health. Thanks to the HPV vaccine, rates of cervical cancer are down among young women. But screenings are also down, and doctors say that’s a big concern. An action item to consider for this month, which is also Cervical Cancer Awareness Month? Making sure you’re up to date on screenings, whether that’s a Pap test (recommended every three years), HPV test (recommended every five years) or co-testing. Guidelines vary by age, so check here to see what’s recommended for you. 🧀 Get your cheese fix. If you’re fond of fondue, this one’s for you: Jan. 20 is Cheese Lover’s Day, and you’d be remiss in not chomping on some cheddar or getting some gouda in your belly. From a health standpoint, cheese is an excellent source of calcium and protein, though full-fat dairy comes with a lot of warnings about sodium and saturated fat that can wreak havoc on your cholesterol level. For the record, Today rates cottage cheese as the healthiest, followed by soft cheeses like ricotta, mozzarella and feta, which tend to be lower in fat. But there’s also no shame in enjoying your favorite cheese in moderation. 🐍 Celebrate the Lunar New Year. Need something fun, festive and awe-inspiring to brighten up those dreary January days? Look for Lunar New Year celebrations, from lion dances to lantern festivals, in your area. The 15-day festival marking the first new moon of the lunar calendar kicks off this year on Jan. 29 and will usher in the Year of the Snake. If you’re new to the event, consider this an opportunity to learn more about deep-rooted cultural customs — including the importance of “sweeping away the dust,” by cleaning the house days beforehand to bring good luck — celebrated in many Asian countries, and to soak up the sights, sounds and foods of the festivities. To do this month: Eat: your greens. It may not be as sexy as spring’s explosions of peas and asparagus, but don’t write off winter produce. This is leafy greens’ time to shine. Slip some spinach into your smoothie for extra iron. Upgrade your salad by swapping out iceberg in favor of vitamin-packed, antioxidant-rich kale or mustard greens (this kale salad laced with pancetta breadcrumbs, pine nuts, currants and parmesan cheese gets a rave review). Swiss chard and collard greens can also liven up your winter meals, but a word of caution: Wash your leaves well. Winter greens rank high on the list of produce with the most pesticides, but a thorough rinse (or buying organic) can offset that. Get: past Quitter’s Day. The second Friday in January (that’s Jan. 10) is known as Quitter’s Day, which marks the point when many people give up on their New Year’s resolutions. (The concept is based on trends data experts noticed in tracking a drop-off in fitness app usage.) So what happens if you’re finding it tough to stay motivated but don’t want to abandon your 2025 goals just yet? One tip experts passed on to Fortune is to try breaking up your resolution into smaller, more manageable goals. If your resolution is to “get in better shape,” for example, specify what that means and map out what you can do on a weekly or even daily basis (doing 20 minutes of weight training on your lunch break, planning a Sunday morning bike ride, etc.) to help you achieve that. You can also see what methods work for frequent resolution-setters here. Take: a news break if you need it. Big political changes are coming this month, which will mark the end of the Biden administration and a second Trump inauguration on Jan. 20. If you’re still burned out from the election cycle discourse, remember that it’s perfectly fine to set boundaries around how much news and social media content you consume. That might involve only allowing yourself a few minutes a day online, muting news alerts or accounts that you find stressful or divisive or focusing more on feel-good content (Adam Sandler movies, cute Moo Deng videos) — or all of the above.",8,[],2025-01-06 04:01:02,2025-01-06 19:27:14

The article detailed Blake Lively's allegations against Baldoni and others over alleged sexual harassment she endured while filming It Ends With Us. Attorney Bryan Freedman filed the lawsuit on behalf of 10 plaintiffs, including Baldoni. This comes after Lively filed a complaint with the California Civil Rights Department on Dec. 20, the same day the Times story was published, and accused Baldoni, the star and director of their hit film, of sexual harassment, retaliation, intentional infliction of emotional distress and more in a bombshell 80-page document. She claims that she suffered harm to her reputation as the result of a smear campaign. On Tuesday, Lively formally filed a lawsuit against Baldoni, his public relations team and film studio. In a statement, Freedman told Variety that the Times ""cowered to the wants and whims of two powerful ‘untouchable’ Hollywood elites, disregarding journalistic practices and ethics once befitting of the revered publication by using doctored and manipulated texts and intentionally omitting texts which dispute their chosen PR narrative."" This is the first of multiple lawsuits, including a potential one against Lively, that Freedman previously said will expose ""those who believe themselves untouchable"" and the details will ""shock everyone."" Before news of Tuesday's lawsuit broke, a source told People that Lively is ""in contact with her team"" and ""knows she'll have an explosive start to the new year."" ""She still believes she's doing the right thing. She's ready to tackle whatever comes her way,"" the insider said. The details in Lively's complaint were disturbing. She accused Baldoni of improvising intimate moments during filming, adding ""gratuitous sexual content"" to the script after she signed on — while allegedly telling her he's not attracted to her — and asking for details about her and husband Ryan Reynolds's sex life. Baldoni and his producing partner Jamey Heath, who's named in the complaint, are accused of trying to watch Lively naked when she changed in her trailer. Baldoni and Heath have denied these ""false"" claims and their lawsuit against the Times provides text messages that allegedly show Lively and Baldoni had friendly correspondence in June per Variety. Here are the key players involved in this dispute and the allegations against them. The actress starred in It Ends With Us and was also a producer on the film. In the complaint, she says she raised concerns about Baldoni’s and Heath's conduct on set last year. According to the complaint, a meeting took place on Jan. 4, 2024, in which she set forth their alleged inappropriate behavior and all parties agreed to implementing safeguards on the set. Thirty rules were put in place, including ""no more showing nude videos or images of women"" to Lively; no more discussion of Baldoni’s and Heath's prior ""pornography addiction""; ""no more improvising of kissing""; and ""no more entering"" Lively's trailer while she's naked. The rules also prohibited Baldoni from adding new “sex scenes, oral sex, or on camera climaxing"" outside of the previously approved script and required that an intimacy coordinator be on the set for all scenes involving nudity. However, the part of Lively's complaint that especially reverberated through the entertainment industry was the alleged smear campaign orchestrated by Baldoni's publicists against Lively, which seemed to expose the cutthroat tactics of the crisis PR world. Baldoni has accused Lively and her team of planting negative stories in the press, which they have denied. On Dec. 31, Lively formally sued Baldoni and others claiming she was subjected to ""further retaliation and attacks"" after the New York Times report. ""Wayfarer and its associates have violated federal and California state law by retaliating against her for reporting sexual harassment and workplace safety concerns,"" she said in a statement obtained by The Hollywood Reporter. ""Now, the defendants will answer for their conduct in federal court. Ms. Lively has brought this litigation in New York, where much of the relevant activities described in the Complaint took place, but we reserve the right to pursue further action in other venues and jurisdictions as appropriate under the law."" The Jane the Virgin actor and director has not specifically addressed any of the allegations made by Lively; however, his lawyer has promised ""a deliberate pursuit of truth."" Baldoni allegedly hired a crisis PR firm for himself and Wayfarer Studios after they believed Lively's team planted unfavorable stories in the press around the film's August release. Baldoni’s lawyer has claimed that a New York Times article, which broke the news of Lively's complaint, ""doctored or spliced without context"" seemingly damaging texts between him and his representative about the supposed smear campaign. ""This lawsuit will uncover and expose the false and destructive narrative that was intentionally engineered by a trusted media publication who relied upon nefarious sources and neglected a thorough fact checking process to confirm the validity of these texts,"" Freedman told People on Dec. 29, adding: ""The truth will not only come to light — it will dismantle the illusions propped up by those who believe themselves untouchable."" The independent production studio behind It Ends With Us was co-founded by Baldoni and Steve Sarowitz in 2019. The studio also has the rights to adapt the film's sequel, It Starts With Us. In a letter after the Jan. 4 meeting, the studio acknowledged that ""although our perspective differs in many aspects, ensuring a safe environment for all is paramount, irrespective of differing viewpoints. Regarding your outlined requests, we find most of them not only reasonable but also essential for the benefit of all parties involved."" Heath is the CEO of Wayfarer Studios and the lead producer on It Ends With Us. He is accused of showing Lively inappropriate videos, including of his wife giving birth, entering her makeup trailer uninvited and more. He signed a side letter to Lively's contract in which he agreed not to retaliate against the actress when implementing her requested safeguards. He has retained Freedman and is expected to be part of the countersuit. An entrepreneur and billionaire philanthropist, Sarowitz reportedly invested $125 million in Wayfarer in 2022. According to Lively's complaint, Sarowitz claimed he was willing to spend $100 million to ""ruin the lives of"" the actress and her family. Sarowitz has retained Freedman as his attorney. Abel is a publicist representing Baldoni and Wayfarer Studios. She previously worked at the PR company Jonesworks before leaving to start her own firm, bringing both Baldoni and Wayfarer along with her as clients. Many of her text messages were included in Lively’s complaint as evidence of the alleged smear campaign — but how, exactly, they were obtained has been the subject of much industry speculation. Freedman claims the texts were cherry-picked and don't reveal the full story. Nathan is a crisis PR expert retained by Wayfarer Studios and Baldoni in August. In one now-infamous text allegedly sent to Abel and revealed in Lively’s complaint, Nathan wrote “we can bury anyone,” apparently referring to Lively. Some of Nathan’s past high-profile clients include Drake and Johnny Depp, who hired Nathan during his successful defamation trial against ex-wife Amber Heard. Baldoni's ex-publicist and Abel's previous employer, Jones claims Abel and others initiated a secret smear campaign against Lively behind her back. She filed her own civil lawsuit against the same group named in Lively’s complaint. ""Behind Jones's back, [Abel and Nathan] secretly coordinated with Baldoni and [his studio] Wayfarer to implement an aggressive media smear campaign against Baldoni’s film co-star,"" the lawsuit claims. The studio was the distributor of It Ends With Us. After the Jan. 4 meeting, Sony agreed to have an ""active, daily role in overseeing physical production"" for the remainder of shooting. Sony is not named as a defendant in Lively's complaint. After the film wrapped, Lively had a creative battle with Baldoni and Heath. She made her own cut of the movie, with Sony's support, and brought on her own editors and a composer. Sony ultimately distributed Lively's version of the film. The studio publicly issued support for Lively in a statement after she filed the complaint. Actor Ryan Reynolds, who is married to Lively, acted as a representative for his wife before production resumed on the film to ensure agreed upon safeguards were put in place. Baldoni allegedly mentioned Reynolds when texting Abel and Nathan. According to messages included in the complaint, Baldoni wrote to them about how Sarowitz suggested ""flipping the narrative"" when it came to Reynolds, like talking about his involvement in the film’s script. Lively revealed at the premiere that Reynolds rewrote a key scene in the film. According to the complaint, Baldoni and Sarowitz ""suggested ways to manipulate those rumors to make Mr. Reynolds appear to be anti-feminist."" Nathan allegedly wrote back, ""this is an easy flip"" and said she was working on such a story. In Baldoni's claims Reynolds berated him during a meeting at the couple's New York residence, and according to Tuesday's lawsuit, Reynolds accused Baldoni ""of 'fat shaming'"" the actress. The suit claims Reynolds pressured agency WME — home to Baldoni, Reynolds and Lively — to drop the director during July's Deadpool and Wolverine. This allegedly happened before Baldoni hired a crisis PR agency. WME ultimately dropped Baldoni earlier this month after Lively's filing. A WME rep denied to Variety the company pressured from Reynolds or Lively.",2.3k,[],2025-01-06 04:02:05,2025-01-06 19:27:14

Look to the skies in these 18 states on New Year's Eve.,,US,Yahoo News,3 min read,Here's where you may see aurora borealis from the geomagnetic storm forecast for Dec. 31.,Katie MatherReporter,2024-12-31T13:11:42.000Z,"If you haven't seen the northern lights this year — today might be your last chance. And what a fun way to ring in the new year! The Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) issued a geomagnetic storm watch for Dec. 31 ahead of an incoming solar storm caused by an eruption of solar material (otherwise known as a coronal mass ejection or CME) that happened on the sun’s surface on Dec. 29. A CME explosion is caused by the sun’s magnetic field and, like in this case, can sometimes result in incredible aurora displays. The SWPC said that the G3-level of the geomagnetic storm is “infrequent but not uncommon” and that the aurora “may become visible over many of the northern states,” as far south as Illinois and Oregon. NASA reported that northern lights' visibility hit a 500-year peak this year because of the frequent solar activity, with the sun having reached its solar maximum in October. These storms are caused by several solar-related changes that impact the Earth’s magnetosphere, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) explains. The largest ones, like the one expected to occur on Dec. 31, are associated with CMEs. Sometimes solar storms can cause issues with satellites and navigation systems and can cause problematic currents with power grids and pipelines. NASA reports that thanks to Earth’s magnetic field and atmosphere, residents are not directly harmed by any of these storms. Instead, they can witness solar flares and northern lights, as is expected in this case. According to the NOAA, solar storms of this scale are predicted to bring an aurora that ""will become quite bright and active."" A storm watch is in effect for Dec. 31. CMEs travel several million miles per hour, so the NOAA predicts that the best time to see the lights would be between 10 p.m. ET on Dec. 30 and 10 a.m. ET on Dec. 31, according to Space.com. There’s also another anticipated time slot of 4 p.m. ET on Dec. 31 to 10 p.m. ET on Jan. 1. The SWPC anticipates that Alaska will have the best chance of seeing the lights starting Monday evening. Other states that are likely to see the lights are Washington, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Michigan and Wisconsin. New York, Oregon, Wyoming, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine are along the aurora’s projected view line as of Monday. The NOAA says that viewers must get away from city lights to best view the aurora. Even if the aurora is reported as being active during the day, the best time to view the lights is usually within an hour or two of midnight local time. A full moon can also diminish the aurora’s brightness for viewers, but the next full moon isn’t until Jan. 13. If viewers are looking at maps, the NOAA also notes that the aurora does not need to be directly overhead to be seen — especially if it’s bright and weather conditions are right. The year 2024 was huge for solar news. In April, a total solar eclipse was visible to millions of Americans, which was then followed by multiple widespread northern and southern lights caused by CMEs. While the solar maximum peak passed in October and no total solar eclipses were forecast for next year, 2025 will still be affected by the heightened solar activity of these last few months.",402,[],2025-01-06 04:02:05,2025-01-06 19:27:14

Here's the wellness advice we're taking with us into 2025.,Kaitlin ReillyReporter,2024-12-31T12:00:03.000Z,"Hello, Yahoo Life readers! My name is Kaitlin Reilly, and I spent 2024 rounding up the year’s best health and wellness tips. My team and I have covered it all: from the simple (do couch exercises for better sleep) to the quirky (play Dungeons & Dragons to boost well-being) to the dubious (mouth taping, anyone?). It’s been quite the journey! So to close out 2024, I’m sharing the best, most tangible advice I found throughout the last 365 days. Looking to crush your health goals in 2025? This advice is evergreen — you can take with you into the new year and beyond. Dive into the bite-sized pieces of advice below. Have a black spatula you routinely use to flip your eggs? You may want to swap it out for a wooden or metal one instead. While the health implications are still being researched, a study in Chemosphere found high levels of flame retardants in black utensils and products — including the EPA-banned chemical decaBDE. Though there was some initial miscalculation on exactly how much of these chemicals were in the black plastic products, experts told Yahoo Life that it did not change their conclusion that there are still safer kitchen products to use — like, say, a set of bamboo utensils. Better to be safe than sorry! Many people on foodie TikTok were eating small fish in 2024. That’s due, in part, to the rise in popularity of the pantry-friendly tinned variety, which are less expensive and last longer than their fresh alternatives. But there are plenty of health reasons to eat small fish too: A 2024 paper from Nagoya University in Japan found that people who ate small fish like smelt and sardines had a lower chance of dying from cancer. That, coupled with nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D and calcium, should give you a good reason to add sardines to a salad or incorporate them into pasta sauce. But what’s the healthiest fish of them all? Glad you asked. While tiny swimmers like sardines made the list, they also recommended salmon, farmed trout and Atlantic mackerel, all of which are high in omega-3 fatty acids, as well as B and D vitamins and selenium. While fish may have a shiny health halo, the experts also recommended limiting high-mercury types, which include shark, swordfish, marlin, king mackerel, tilefish and bigeye tuna. And while sushi is generally healthy for most people, it should be avoided by pregnant people, older adults and anyone with a compromised immune system due to the potential risk of food-borne illness. Mindfulness is the practice of being fully present and aware of the current moment, without judgment, allowing you to calmly accept your thoughts, feelings and sensations. It can also help you get more movement in your life. A study in the journal Mental Health and Physical Activity found that using mindfulness techniques — such as those offered through audio apps — can help people tune into their bodies, manage discomfort and stay motivated to work out. This means you may be more likely to stick with a routine over time — which is important in order to gain the benefits of regular exercise, like better heart health, improved mental well-being and increased strength and endurance. Few veggies are as crunchable as baby carrots, and as we learned in 2024, there’s a good reason to include them often in your diet. Research presented at the Nutrition 2024 conference found that eating baby carrots just three times a week significantly increased skin carotenoid levels in young adults, which is a win for your health. Carotenoids — aka pigments found in colorful fruits and vegetables — are linked to better vision, stronger immune function and even UV skin protection. (But please, still wear sunscreen!) While it typically takes large daily servings of fruits and vegetables to boost carotenoids, this study showed that just a few carrots weekly can make a noticeable difference. You also won’t reap the benefits exclusively from baby carrots, as they are just shaved versions of their bigger peers. Find fun ways to include a rabbit’s favorite treat in your diet: blend carrots into a soup, snack on them with hummus or even toss a handful into a carrot cake-inspired smoothie. After a big meal, one of the best things that you can do for your health is go for a walk. If you happen to pass gas during this stroll, even better. “Walking that leads to farting and burping takes pressure off the GI tract, which reduces stretching of the muscles, and this alleviates the bloated feeling,” Dr. David Clarke, who is board-certified in internal medicine and gastroenterology, previously told Yahoo Life. Relieving uncomfortable post-dinner gut issues isn’t the only reason to move after a meal. Doing so can also improve your blood sugar regulation, both in the short and long term — important for both preventing as well as managing conditions like diabetes. Most health advice tells you to cut down on screen time, but the internet isn’t all bad. A 2024 study published in the journal Technology, Mind, and Behavior, which analyzed data from 2.5 million people across 168 countries, found that about 85% of internet users reported higher levels of well-being compared to non-users, even when adjusting for economic factors. That’s not to say you should cite this study to justify soaking up everything the internet has to offer. Doomscrolling — in which you endlessly browse negative news or social media posts — can be detrimental to your mental health, per a separate 2024 study published in the journal Nature Human Behaviour. In order to use the web well, try setting time limits for your online activities, focusing on positive content and taking breaks to head into the real world, such as for a mindful, phone-free walk. We all have that friend who loves their 10-mile run, but if that’s not you — or if you simply don’t have the time to be that person — there are a lot of benefits to short workouts, too. (You’d also be in good company: Strava’s annual Year in Sport report found that more than 20% of all activity tracked by users was under 20 minutes long.) Short workouts are not only easier to squeeze into your day (and can help you break up unhealthy sedentary time) but may offer you the opportunity to workout even harder than you would with a longer bout of activity. High-intensity interval training, in which you workout at your maximum intensity for 30 seconds or so before resting, can help improve your strength, energy, and stamina, one expert told Yahoo Life. Try it at home by resting between rounds of burpees or mountain climbers for just five minutes. You may go for dumbbells at the gym, but there’s a good reason to consider working out with kettlebells as well, according to research presented at the 2024 Integrative Physiology of Exercise. After six months, participants in the study who worked out with these bell-shaped weights experienced increased in muscle mass, grip strength, and upper leg strength. After a year, the group showed improved physical function, including taking less time to climb a flight of stairs and to rise from a chair. Want to get started? Experts told Yahoo Life it’s important to start out with the basics: try simple, single-joint exercises like a standing hip hinge or strict shoulder press before going for more advanced movements, like kettlebell swings, which engage multiple muscles at once. There’s a lot to be mindful of regarding your health when traveling on an airplane, like sanitizing that tray table or wearing a mask to avoid germs or spreading them. One thing that Yahoo Health Editor Rachel Bender learned this year is that even your skin can be affected by plane travel, as harmful UV rays can penetrate the windows. Apply sunscreen before your flight, and shut that window shade to avoid it. 2024 was the year we all became a little skeptical of our gas stove — and rightfully so, as research found concerning levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in homes with gas or propane stoves. While using your stove less frequently (try cooking with your air fryer instead) or replacing it with an electric or convection model will help, there’s a simple thing you can do to reduce harmful gas when you do decide to turn it on: Open windows or doors for extra ventilation, and turn on the ventilation hood, if you have one, to remove potentially harmful air. If there was one nut that reigned supreme in 2024, it was the mighty pistachio. As we learned this year, the lower-calorie nut (which is full of protein and fiber) may also help your eyesight. Snacking on two ounces of pistachios every day may protect your peepers from the damage associated with from blue light and aging, according to a study from Tufts University. Time to hunt down that Dubai chocolate bar — or whip up a batch of lemon pistachio cookies. Walking is one of the best ways to incorporate movement into your life and avoid sedentary time, but sometimes, you want to kick things up a notch. Using a weighted backpack while walking — a practice known as rucking — was a big trend in 2024, and it’s worth trying in the New Year as well. Carrying a weighted backpack means your muscles have to work harder as you move, which can improve your cardiovascular and even skeletal health. You don’t have to go for a weighted backpack to add some extra challenge to your walk. A weighted vest, wrist or ankle weights can also add some oomph. You know that veggies are more nutrient dense than, say, a bag of cookies — but do you know what form of cooking is healthiest? This year, researchers discovered that using an air fryer to cook food — as opposed to a stovetop or oven — is better for keeping pollutants out of your indoor air. It’s a win-win for the small-but-powerful device: You’ll also use less oil to get veggies crispy. While all fruits have unique nutritional profiles that can make them a great addition to your diet, blueberries give you the most bang for your buck, according to dietitian Samantha Cassetty. That’s because these berries have antioxidants and fiber, which can support heart health, brain function and overall well-being. Plus, they’re so versatile! Use them to add sweetness to oatmeal or yogurt, or toss frozen ones into a smoothie. You might be thinking that standing (such as at an elevated desk) is a major improvement over sitting — even your Apple Watch gives you points for doing so! However, 2024 research from the University of Turku in Finland found that excess standing may negatively affect your blood pressure. Instead of merely standing up, get moving: Do simple stretches, shake out your body or take a quick lap around the room. In 2024, we learned that catching up on sleep over the weekend might actually be good for your heart. New research suggests grabbing some extra zzzs on Saturday or Sunday can reduce your heart disease risk by 20% — especially if you’re skimping on sleep during the week — less than seven hours a night, according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. While experts told Yahoo Life it’s still best to stick to a consistent sleep schedule, spending a bit more time in bed could help you feel more rested and ready to tackle the week. If getting to the gym or going for a long run feels almost impossible during the work week, there’s some good news: you can reserve your exercise time for the weekend and still reap health benefits. Research published this year in Circulation found that people who followed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention weekly recommendation of 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous activity across just two days had the same lower rates of heart attacks, stroke, obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure as those who broke their workout time up over the full week. So, schedule a sweaty spin class, a long hike or big run when you have all the time in the world.",148,[],2025-01-06 04:02:05,2025-01-06 19:27:14

We spoke with people who use pet strollers, reported on the “dumb phone” trend and highlighted potential kitchen hazards. We talked to experts about COVID-19, colds, allergies, bird flu and seasonal flu and researchers about the latest developments on vaccines, disease prevention and treatment advancements. We offered wellness tips on making the most of your walk, how to sleep longer and eat better. We covered trends like “dirty soda,” “girl dinner” and “sexy water” and debunked a few — like Celtic sea salt and chin straps — too. But of all the articles that we produced, the following stood out the most. From royal cancer intrigue to young adult health concerns, here are our top 10 original articles of 2024, ranked by page views. There’s been an unusually high number of outbreaks of norovirus in 2024, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, so it tracks that Kaitlin Reilly’s story about avoiding the highly contagious stomach bug was a top performer. Her reporting found that the best trick to staying healthy is a simple one: Wash your hands and be sure to scrub them with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds (or about the length of the birthday song). If you do get sick, hydration is key to recovering. If knowledge is power, then this article provides helpful insight into some scary statistics. Between 2012 and 2019, the number of adults between ages 45 and 64 dying of strokes rose by 7%, followed by a further spike of 12% between 2019 and 2021, according to an August CDC report. As Rebecca Corey wrote, experts point to a few culprits. Rising rates of risk factors, including high blood pressure and obesity, are contributing, as are sedentary lifestyles and unhealthy diets. Missed doctor appointments and unrecognized symptoms may also contribute to higher rates of stroke and death from it among under-65s. By eating heart-healthy diets, aiming to get 150 minutes of exercise a week, controlling blood pressure, getting annual checkups and knowing the signs of stroke, middle-aged people can reduce their risks now and in the future. In February, King Charles III was diagnosed with an unspecified form of cancer (just weeks later, Kate Middleton announced that she too was undergoing cancer treatment). Buckingham Palace never revealed what type of cancer Charles was battling, instead calling it a “separate issue of concern” that was discovered during a procedure for a “benign prostate enlargement.” A palace spokesperson later clarified that the king did not have prostate cancer. From reproductive rights to diet culture and the “tradwife” phenomenon: Conversations about women’s bodies showed no signs of slowing in 2024. And 27-year-old Sydney Sweeney’s body has been put at the center of cultural conversations over and over again. However, the Euphoria and Anyone but You breakout star hit back at commenters who criticized her figure in a photo of her in a bikini taken by a paparazzo. Posts about the photo of Sweeney “ignited a deeply depressing but all-too-familiar discourse,” Zeynab Mohamed wrote in her Substack. “When [Sweeney] looks polished on Instagram, she’s accused of being fake. When caught candidly by paparazzi, she’s criticised for being too real.” Mangione, the 26-year-old who was arrested and charged with murder in the death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, allegedly made social media posts about spondylolisthesis, a back condition in which a vertebra slips out of place. The injury, which was aggravated by surfing, was “completely devastating,” according to a Reddit account that appears to belong to Mangione. For people with spondylolisthesis, “if the nerves are pinched ... putting weight on your spine can hurt a lot,” Dr. Uzma Samadani, a Minnesota neurologist specializing in spine surgery, told Natalie Rahhal. “It is an excruciating pain, and it doesn’t go away with conservative management.” In the U.S. in 2024, there were 17 severe (meaning losses exceeded $1 billion) storm events, four tropical cyclone events, one wildfire event and two winter storm events as of Nov. 1, according to the National Centers for Environmental Information. That may be why our guide to storm safety was one of the year’s top stories. Injuries due to turbulence are still rare, but they’re becoming more common as incidents of severely rough air rise, according to a study from the University of Reading in the U.K. Bruises, broken bones and concussions due to midair bumps may sound alarming, but for most passengers, they’re likely preventable. Korin Miller rounded up experts’ best advice for how to stay safe in even the worst turbulence. The main takeaway? Stay seated, with your seat belt on. Financial health matters too, and Drea de Matteo found that out firsthand. After vaulting to fame as Adriana La Cerva on The Sopranos, the actress pumped the brakes on her career in order to spend more time caring for her children and childhood nanny. But, as she faced foreclosure on the family’s home, de Matteo’s teenage children’s joke about putting her feet on OnlyFans became a real path out of both financial and emotional insecurity. The experience helped de Matteo save her home and recognize, “Man, I’m a 52-year-old woman with a smokin’ hot body,” she told Maressa Brown. The Princess of Wales kept much of her cancer journey private after announcing her diagnosis with an undisclosed form of the disease in March. By September, the mom of three shared that she had finished chemotherapy, but said her “path to healing and full recovery is long” in an emotional video posted to her Instagram. Cancer was discovered when the royal underwent major abdominal surgery. Afterward, she was treated with what she described as a “preventative” form of chemotherapy. Experts applauded her “proactive measures” and told Rahhal that this type of treatment might be used when tumors were completely removed surgically but doctors want to reduce the risk of recurrence. Our most-read story of the year aimed to shed light on a disturbing trend: More young adults are getting cancer, according to a study published in July. Each generation since the baby boomers has seen an increase in 17 cancers, including pancreatic, colorectal, breast and gastric cancers. Even as rates and deaths from these cancers decline among older adults, people under age 50 are getting and dying from them at rising rates (although it’s still relatively rare to be diagnosed in younger adulthood). In fact, people born in 1990 are at two- to threefold higher risks of certain cancers than those born in 1965, the study found. Why this is happening is a hot topic of research and far from settled science. But most of the cancers that are on the rise are linked to obesity — and experts said that excess body weight and the inflammation it causes are the prime suspects. But that carries a silver lining. The best things you can do to reduce your risks make good New Year’s goals: Maintain a healthy body weight, exercise regularly and have a balanced diet high in plants and fish and low in red meat, ultra-processed foods and alcohol. And, of course, don’t smoke.",15,[],2025-01-06 04:02:05,2025-01-06 19:27:14
https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/new-years-resolution-lessons-from-people-who-followed-through-on-theirs-100046852.html,New Year's resolution lessons from people who followed through on theirs,,Lifestyle,Yahoo Life,7 min read,People share what works — and what doesn't — when it comes to achieving their goals.,Sarah Hunter Simanson,2025-01-02T18:09:29.000Z,"According to the Pew Research Center, most Americans — 70%, in fact — don't make New Year's resolutions, and of those, 12% say it's because they're too hard to keep. But that leaves 30% of us who do go into the new year determined to unleash our better selves — the version of you that doesn't scroll on the phone for an hour in bed each night, eats lots of veggies and actually goes to the gym instead of just swanning around the house in lycra. Sometimes it works out. Sometimes it doesn't. And what helps one person achieve their goals may not suit someone else. But as Jan. 1 draws nearer, Yahoo Life turned to five resolution-minded folks to see what they've learned along the way — and how their experiences might help others greeting Jan. 1 gain newfound determination. Read on to see what has set them up for success. Danielle Mini used to be a teacher, and she loves the natural points of the year that encourage people to reset. For her, this was always the beginning of the school year, her birthday and New Year’s Day. She always makes resolutions, and in 2024, Mini set two goals. One was to be more neighborly, and while this did inspire Mini to reach out to her neighbors more, it was difficult for her to judge her own success because it wasn’t a very concrete goal. But Mini’s second goal was more specific. “I wasn’t going to buy any new clothes,"" the 55-year-old tells Yahoo Life, noting that reading about the fashion industry's environmental impact made her want to scale back. ""Nothing at all. I said that if I did buy something it would be from a thrift store or a consignment shop."" In the end, Mini was able to stick to her goal. “It’s easier than you think,” she says. For 2025, Mini plans to do something else to help the environment: compost. She has also written a memoir and will work to find an agent in the new year. Because both goals are “quite actionable"" and tied to her interests, she feels good about her ability to achieve them. Every New Year’s Eve when Lillian Kay was a child, she and her mom would write down their favorite things that happened over the past year and put them in a box. Now that Kay is 29, this tradition has evolved into the pair spending the afternoon together on New Year’s Eve and setting their resolutions together. Making those resolutions a reality hasn't always been easy. In 2023, they created a monthly action plan in an effort to be more organized and stay on track with their goals. That approach turned out to be too structured for their liking, and they felt bogged down by logistics. For 2024, mother and daughter decided to try something new. “This year we did a 24 for ’24 list,” Kay tells Yahoo Life. Their resolutions were more of a bucket list that included a mix of fun activities and more serious goals. Kay started tennis lessons, read more nonfiction and ran a half-marathon. The only things she hasn’t crossed off her list yet are to take a pottery class and start physical therapy, both of which she plans to at least schedule before the year ends. The list worked well for her. “I feel like we made it more fun while also including the more serious stuff, and [I] feel like we have been more successful this year than we have in previous years just by [bringing] a lighter element to it,” Kay says. It worked so well that she and her mom plan to do it again — and are already preparing to make a “25 for '25” list. Like Kay, 44-year-old Monica May likes the annual tradition of using New Year’s resolutions as a way to reset. But three years ago, she realized that traditional resolutions weren’t working for her. That year, she’d set the goal to do a half Ironman triathlon and spent several months training, only to injure her knee two weeks before the competition. Because her resolution was so specific, and she couldn’t complete it while injured, May realized that she needed to rethink how she set her yearly goals. The next year, she instead set a word as her intention of the year. Resilience has been one; another year she settled on wander to offset the stagnant feeling she'd been experiencing. Using that as her guide, May set out to travel at least every other month and wound up visiting eight new places. Wearable reminders have helped. “I had a necklace this year that was an intention necklace that had the word resilience,” May tells Yahoo Life. Last year, she had a bracelet that said wanderlust. While others have found luck with more concrete, specific goals, May finds that taking a more fluid approach works for her. ""[It] takes off pressure and sets a better success rate for me personally,"" she says. ""It gives me more flexibility and less of a chance to be mad at myself for not doing something — or, conversely, laugh at myself for not remembering what [my resolution] was.” For 2025, May’s word is going to be “shine.” She explains: “I held myself back a lot this past year and need to remember to veer toward action and let myself ‘shine.'"" Personal development and leadership coach Jenna Zabrosky leads ""Bridge to 25"" sessions guiding clients through their resolutions. She also practices what she preaches when it comes to setting her own. “Instead of thinking of a resolution as something that I need to resolve [or] something that I need to fix, I look at what worked well and what I want to celebrate and continue,” Zabrosky tells Yahoo Life. To start this process, Zabrosky writes down celebrations and appreciations for herself to acknowledge what she did well over the past year. She also likes to take time to write down celebrations for the people in her community who helped her with those achievements. Then she writes a vision for where she’d like to be at the end of 2025. She imagines a scene from that time, describes it in detail and then extracts goals from that vision. For 2025, for example, she's looking to do things that increase stability in her life — and find the perfect place to live. Focusing on a vision can ""take you out of the current circumstances of your life to have a picture of what’s possible,"" Zabrosky says. If your vision entails you traveling the world, for example, you might make a resolution to save a certain amount of money to fund a big trip, or find a job that offers more vacation time. As a yoga teacher and wellness and life coach, Maria Kugler encourages her clients to remember to give themselves grace during the winter. While New Year’s resolutions can be motivating — and something Kugler likes to set for herself — embarking on new goals doesn't necessarily need to be tied to the start of the year. “I don’t like to rush into January as fast as I used to,"" Kugler tells Yahoo Life. That was especially true last year, when she gave birth on Jan. 3. “I was in a baby cave for the first three months [of the year], but it gave me time at 2 in the morning to get out my Notes app and jot things down,"" Kugler says. All that journaling ""really did set me up"" to achieve her goals — including starting strength training and becoming board-certified as a wellness coach — once things settled down, however. She encourages her clients to take some time before diving into their resolutions; the winter, she notes, can be a period of rest rather than rushing into, and eventually burning out on, goal-setting. “I find that the biggest barrier to having a chance to reset and reflect and really set themselves up for the next year is just slowing down and taking the time to reflect on the year prior,” she says.",25,[],2025-01-06 04:02:05,2025-01-06 19:27:14

Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Mufasa: The Lion King were the top two films over Christmas in a neck-and-neck finish, earning $59.8 million and $63.9 million, respectively, over the five-day holiday weekend. Moana 2 and Wicked, released around Thanksgiving, also continue to draw many moviegoers and break all kinds of records. Looking at the overall trend for 2024, audiences have made it clear that they’ll show up in theaters for PG fare. Inside Out 2, the highly anticipated sequel that gave us all the feels when it came out in June, is the top film for the year, ahead of the very un-PG superhero comedy Deadpool & Wolverine, Box Office Mojo data shows. In third place is Despicable Me 4, followed by Moana 2 (No. 4) and Wicked (No. 6). Kung Fu Panda 4 also cracked the top 10 (No. 8). The Wild Robot, The Garfield Movie and IF are all further down the list but nevertheless in the 25 top-grossing films this year. Each pulled in over $100 million domestically. Harold and the Purple Crayon was a standout clunker among the many box office successes. Hollywood has taken notice of parents tapping their credit cards for tickets to kid-friendly films — with 2025 already promising a stellar lineup. This insanely popular graphic novel series from Dav Pilkey, who also gave us Captain Underpants, is finally hitting the big screen. It’s about a half-dog, half-man who fights crime — like the villain Petey the Cat (voiced by Pete Davidson) — although he is frequently distracted by squirrels, balls and his over-the-top affection for the police chief. The Dog Man series has more than 60 million books in print — with translations in 47 languages — making it one of the bestselling graphic novel series of all time, and, probably, a big box office draw. The release date of the third film in the series — which sees the lovable British bear travel to visit family in Peru — was moved from 2024 to 2025 to avoid the whole Moana 2-Sonic 3-Mufasa box office bonanza in the U.S. It was released in the U.K. in November and is already a hit there. There’s been some drama around this live-action adaptation of the 1937 Disney cartoon — like the CGI dwarfs — that stars Rachel Zegler in the title role and Gal Gadot as the evil queen, but we don’t anticipate that it will keep people from going to the theater to see it. Snow White is a classic, even in a modern format. Just as most elementary school kids have read a Dav Pilkey book at this point, Minecraft, the video game, has a massive audience of over 204 million monthly active players, according to data from Activeplayer.io. No doubt a good portion of them — who build worlds online — will check out the adventure comedy film about the game, which stars Jack Black, Emma Myers and Jason Momoa. The animated franchise — about a little girl, Lilo, her sister, Nani, and the extraterrestrial blue pal they adopt, named Stitch — has been successful for Disney for two decades. This is the first live action adaptation, directed by Dean Fleischer Camp (Marcel the Shell With Shoes On), and is brought to life with CGI. Zach Galifianakis and Hannah Waddingham are among those with voice roles. The animated trilogy — beginning with 2010’s How to Train Your Dragon — also gets a live action adaptation. It follows a young misfit Viking teen named Hiccup, who aspires to hunt dragons, and tells the story of how he unexpectedly befriends an injured dragon he names Toothless. Pixar’s Elio is about a young space fanatic with a big imagination and huge alien obsession who gets beamed up to space and is mistaken as Earth’s leader. The film includes the voices of Zoe Saldaña, Brad Garrett and Jameela Jamil. Like Dog Man, the Bad Guys is a popular graphic novel series for kids about a gang of animal criminals. The first film, released in 2022, was a hit, so the sequel is coming, with the crew finding it challenging adjusting to being good guys. An all-female squad of criminals helps pull them out of retirement for a final job. Sam Rockwell, Marc Maron and Awkwafina are among the actors with voice roles. The second part of the epic story — starring Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande — will hit screens in time for Thanksgiving. The studio won’t need another long promotional campaign to get people to see it. They’ll be lined up and ready to sing along. While it may feel as if the DMV sloth from the 2016 original is behind this sequel, it’s finally coming out in 2025. The first film was a huge box office hit (No. 4 that year) and this one sees rabbit cop Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) and her pal, the fox Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), team up again for a new case. A fourth film, based on the popular TV series that premiered in 1999, is coming to the big screen to close out the year. The film will follow the yellow sponge as it travels deep into the ocean to face the ghost of a pirate specter known as the Flying Dutchman (voiced by Mark Hamill).",8,[],2025-01-06 04:02:05,2025-01-06 19:27:14

On Friday, Dallas Mavericks star Luka Doncic became the latest professional athlete to have his home burglarized. Thieves reportedly broke into Doncic’s home in the Preston Hollow neighborhood of Dallas and stole $30,000 worth of jewelry. The FBI report, which was issued prior to the break-in at Doncic’s home, noted that between September and November ""organized theft groups allegedly burglarized the homes of at least nine professional athletes."" The break-ins were pre-planned and appear designed to take place when the athletes were not home. “These preparation tactics enable theft groups to conduct burglaries in a short amount of time. Organized theft groups bypass alarm systems, use Wi-Fi jammers to block Wi-Fi connections and disable devices, cover security cameras, and obfuscate their identities,” the FBI report said, according to ABC News. The NBA and the NFL have issued memos to players and coaches warning that it’s no coincidence that high-profile players have been targeted. “The homes of professional athletes across multiple sports leagues have become increasingly targeted for burglaries by organized and skilled groups. Law enforcement officials have noted these groups appear to exploit team schedules to target athletes’ homes on game days,” the NBA said in a November memo. Here is a list of recent burglaries that have taken place at the homes of sports stars: Sept. 15: NBA guard Mike Conley Jr. of the Minnesota Timberwolves had his home broken into while he was attending a Minnesota Vikings game, and jewelry was stolen. Sept 16: The Minnesota home of NBA forward Karl Anthony Towns was burglarized, with thieves getting away with property worth more than $100,000. Oct. 6: Local police were called to the home of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes after a break-in was reported by a member of his security team the night before an Oct. 7 home game. “It's disappointing. I can't get into too many details because the investigation is still ongoing,” Mahomes said during a Nov. 13 press conference. Oct. 7: A thief broke into Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce’s home while he was playing against the New Orleans Saints. Police had confirmed that $20,000 in cash was stolen but did not previously disclose a stolen watch that has now been recovered in Providence, R.I. Nov. 2: The home of Milwaukee Bucks forward Bobby Portis was broken into while he was playing a game against the Cleveland Cavaliers. He has offered a $40,000 reward for information that leads to the return of his belongings after he put out a plea on social media saying that thieves took “most of my prized possessions.” Nov. 29: Dallas Star hockey player Tyler Seguin reported that $500,000 in watches were stolen from his home while he was playing a home game at American Airlines Arena. No one was at home at the time of the robbery, though video of the crime was captured by security cameras. Dec. 9: The Ohio home of Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow was broken into while Burrows was in Texas playing a game against the Dallas Cowboys. Dec. 23: Thieves targeted Doncic’s home in North Dallas, making off with $30,000 in jewelry. The level of sophistication involved in the planning and execution of the burglaries has led officials to conclude that an organized crime group is behind them, ABC reported. Though the majority of the burglaries have been conducted while the famous residents are not home, the FBI is also concerned about the possibility of violent encounters. “While many burglaries occur while homes are unoccupied, some burglaries occur while residents are home. In these instances, individuals are encouraged to seek law enforcement help and avoid engaging with criminals, as they may be armed or use violence if confronted,” the FBI report stated.",936,[],2025-01-06 04:02:05,2025-01-06 19:27:14

Needless to say, you’re busy — but it’s still worth making time to look after your health and well-being, whether that means sneaking a nutritious ingredient into your favorite dishes, moving your body or making other good-for-you choices as you navigate the holiday party circuit. Here’s your guide to living your best life this month. 🍇 Ring in 2025 with ... grapes. If you're the superstitious sort, you might have your lucky black-eyed peas and collard greens ready to go on Jan. 1. But what you eat on New Year's Eve could also bring you luck in the new year. In Spain, it's traditional to eat 12 grapes at midnight — a custom known as ""las doce uvas de la suerte,"" or ""the 12 grapes of luck."" Each grape represents a month of the year and is meant to be quickly eaten with each chime of the clock in the first minute of the new year. If that sounds like a big choking hazard, you can look to other parts of the world for auspicious midnight treats, from pomegranate seeds to lentils. Conversely, some foods — including lobster and winged fowl — are associated with bad luck, according to Delish. 💲 Check your FSA balance. If you have a flexible spending account (FSA) for health care expenses, make sure you use it up before it expires (which usually happens at the end of the year, though some plans roll over until March). Get your money's worth by seeing if you have leftover funds — and if you do, start spending. If you have doctor appointments you haven't gotten around to (like the dentist or optometrist), book them ASAP and get reimbursed for co-payments and services. Otherwise, stock up on health-related purchases ranging from high-tech gadgets (mini massage gun, anyone?) and menstrual hygiene products to sunscreen and sick day kit essentials like bandages and over-the-counter cold meds. 📋 Prep those resolutions. First things first: You don’t have to set a New Year’s resolution. But if you’re goal-oriented and like having some benchmarks to keep you motivated, go right ahead. Because Jan. 1 will be here before you know it, take this time to reflect on what changes you’d like to make and why, and what steps (such as daily benchmarks or getting an accountability buddy) can set you up for success. Need more guidance? Here’s what therapists have to say about sticking to resolutions (or skipping them altogether). 👐🏼 Wash your hands. “But I already wash my hands,” you’re insisting. And while we trust that that is indeed the case, we also know that there’s always room for improvement — and that there’s a reason why there was a whole week (psst: it was Dec. 1-7) dedicated to raising awareness about handwashing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands with soap for at least 20 seconds — roughly the time it takes to sing “Happy Birthday” or recite the intro to Law & Order twice — to avoid spreading or picking up germs. And as Yahoo’s very own health editor Rachel Grumman Bender has noted, drying your hands thoroughly is crucial, as bacteria can thrive on wet skin. 🥣 Eat cottage cheese. Cottage cheese won’t win any beauty contests, but frankly, it doesn’t need to. The curdled dairy option is low in calories, high in protein, rich in B vitamins and, when fermented, packed with probiotics that can benefit gut health. Need another nudge? Dec. 30 is National Cottage Cheese Day (whee!), so grab your spoon and dig in — or try one of these TikTok-approved recipe swaps. ❤️ Donate. GivingTuesday was Dec. 3 this year, and it’s a call to be generous when it comes to the causes you care about most. While financial donations to the charity of your choice are always welcome, there are other ways to give back: Pick up litter at your local park, collect nonperishable items for your local food pantry, help a neighbor in need, donate blood ... you get the idea. 🌨️ Watch out for signs of seasonal affective disorder. Gloomy weather and a lack of daylight can put a damper on anyone’s mood. But when is the “winter blues” a sign of something more serious? With December being Seasonal Depression Awareness Month, it’s important to recognize symptoms of the form of depression known as SAD; these can include a lack of energy, feelings of sadness or hopelessness, weight gain and a tendency to oversleep, typically during the late fall and early winter. 🧘🏻‍♂️ Streeeeeetch. If you’re not loosening up your limbs on Dec. 11 (National Stretching Day), what are you even doing? Stretching regularly can boost your mood, ease aches and pains, improve posture and flexibility, and more. Here are some moves to get you started. ✏️ Do a crossword puzzle. Did you know that December is a big month for crossword puzzles? Dec. 8 was National Crossword Solvers Day, while Dec. 21 was National Crossword Puzzle Day. Celebrate one (or both) by unleashing your inner cruciverbalist (that’s a 14-letter word meaning “a person skilled at creating or solving crossword puzzles,” by the way) and sitting down with a puzzle. It’s good for your brain health! ❄️ Make way for winter. The winter solstice began Saturday, Dec. 21. The bad news: It was the shortest day of the year (that is, the day with the least amount of sunlight). The good news: From that point on, days become longer, with increasing amounts of sunlight. In the meantime, consider it a good excuse to do as the Scandinavians do and practice hygge (or a similarly cozy, cold-embracing trend). ⛔ Don’t fall for these holiday food myths. A recent survey found that 39% of people worry about eating too much food over the holidays. As a result, they’re following misguided advice — like not eating all day in anticipation of a big meal, or detoxing after indulging on holiday treats. Experts say holiday weight gain isn’t something to stress over — and there are simple ways to enjoy your eggnog, cookies and other seasonal faves without punishing yourself. 🍸 Keep those holiday cocktails in check. A glass of eggnog here, some spiked hot cocoa there ... the holiday season can get pretty boozy if you’re not careful. If you want to be more mindful about your alcohol consumption and still be merry and bright, consult these expert tips — like having a pal to sip mocktails with or limiting the time you spend at parties with open bars. To do this month: Eat: mandarins. Your favorite berries may be out of season, but mandarins — including satsumas, clementines and tangerines — are just getting started. Small, easy to peel and sometimes seedless, this citrus fruit (which is similar to oranges but belongs to a different species) makes for a handy winter snack and a great source of vitamin C (which may help you cut a winter cold short). Get: yourself something. Gift giving can be stressful and disappointing to boot (like when you’ve been dropping hints about the new gadget you’re desperate to try only to wind up with an itchy sweater that’s three sizes too big). If you’re able, consider setting aside some holiday funds so you can treat yourself to what you really want this year — and ease up some of the pressure surrounding presents. Watch: your favorite holiday films. Revisiting beloved films you associate with the holidays can bring comfort, spark nostalgia and stir up all sorts of feel-good emotions, experts say.

Two employees of the CasaSur Palermo Hotel in Buenos Aires — hotel manager Gilda Martin and receptionist Esteban Grassi — as well as the former One Direction singer’s friend Rogelio “Roger” Nores have been charged with manslaughter, according to the Argentina prosecutor's office. The charges carry a sentence of one to five years in prison. Ezequiel Pereyra, a hotel employee, and Braian Paiz, a waiter at a local restaurant, have been charged with supplying drugs to the British performer. The two were remanded in custody, according to the press release. If convicted, they face four to 15 years in prison. Judge Laura Bruniard said the five people contributed to “creating a risk that resulted in Payne's death.” Forensic experts determined it’s likely Payne was trying to climb from his room’s third-floor balcony on Oct. 16 and became unconscious, leading to the fall, according to the press release. Hotel employee Pereyra is accused of being paid to deliver cocaine to Payne on Oct. 15 at 3:25 a.m. and Oct. 16 between 3:30 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. Prosecutors also claim Payne sent a car to Pereyra’s home to “bring him more narcotics.” Waiter Paiz, who Payne met at a restaurant in the Puerto Madero neighborhood, was allegedly paid to deliver cocaine to the star on Oct. 14, at 3:24 a.m. — and he remained in Payne’s room until 8:15 a.m. He allegedly left, procured more cocaine, and delivered it to Payne at 10:03 a.m. Payne also went to Paiz’s home via taxi and then returned to the hotel. Payne’s friend and travel companion Nores is accused of manslaughter for allegedly failing to fulfill “his duties of care, assistance and aid” to the singer by “abandoning him to his fate, knowing that he was incapable of caring for himself [due to] multiple previous addictions — to alcohol and cocaine.” Prosecutors claim Nores had “full knowledge” of Payne’s “intoxication, vulnerability and helplessness.” The hotel reception manager Grassi was also present in the lobby at that time, according to prosecutors. Instead of keeping Payne safe, they allege that Grassi “led a group of three people who dragged Payne to his room moments before his death” instead of keeping him in a safe place and waiting until he received medical care. been kept in an area without sources of danger — like a balcony — and watched until medical care was provided for him, prosecutors said. The hotel reception manager Grassi was also present in the lobby at that time, according to prosecutors. Instead of keeping Payne safe, they allege, Grassi “led a group of three people who dragged Payne to his room moments before his death” instead of keeping him in a safe place and waiting until he received medical care. According to the press release, Bruniard analyzed evidence collected by the prosecution and developed a hypothesis of what happened. Bruniard wrote in the ruling that testimonies gathered by the prosecutor showed that Payne had a history of addiction. His autopsy, which determined that his “death was caused by multiple trauma and internal and external bleeding,” and showed large quantities of cocaine and alcohol in his system. “On October 16, moments before 5 p.m., Payne was unable to care for himself,” the judge noted, pointing to hotel security footage from the hotel lobby that showed him being carried by three people to his room. He died minutes after being taken to his room, falling from the balcony to the restaurant's patio. “The way he was being handled shows a state of vulnerability,” the judge said, and, while the hotel employees “did not act maliciously,” “bringing Payne up in that state” to his room was “creating a legally disapproved risk to his life.” In the ruling, Bruniard also claimed in her hypothesis that Payne did not faint when he fell, but that, in his state of intoxication, he tried to leave the room via the balcony and fell. “I maintain that [Payne] tried to leave from the balcony of the place where he was left because the forensic experts noted that he did not lose his balance,” Bruniard wrote, citing various investigation reports. ""This is how the fall occurred."" The judge wrote in the ruling that charges were brought against Nores, who was assisting Payne during his stay, because he was seen exiting the hotel 50 minutes before Payne died when the singer’s “state of vulnerability was evident.” The judge said Nores should have consulted a doctor and should not have trusted that the hotel staff would provide care for Payne. Nores detailed Payne’s alleged drug abuse — including hospitalizations, multiple trips to rehab and two resuscitations in just the past two years — in a previous filing in the investigation. “I was a friend who loved him very much, who helped him selflessly in everything I could, who spent my own money to help him, and even then it was not enough,” Nores wrote. “I do not consider that I deserve the accusation that is being leveled at me.” He also said in a statement, “I never abandoned Liam, I went to his hotel three times that day and left 40 minutes before this happened. There were over 15 people at the hotel lobby chatting and joking with him when I left. I could have never imagined something like this would happen.” Paiz said in an interview with TMZ that while he used cocaine and partied with Payne, he didn’t sell him drugs. “They say I’m the dealer, that I carried drugs, that I sold them,” he told the outlet. “And the truth is that no, no I didn’t sell them.”",1.5k,[],2025-01-06 04:02:05,2025-01-06 19:27:46

Here's what to know about the 'invisible killer' and its symptoms.,,US,Yahoo Life,3 min read,The “invisible killer” gas can leak from car engines and everyday appliances. Here's how to protect yourself.,Rebecca CoreyReporter,2024-12-30T17:33:19.000Z,"Cases of apparent carbon monoxide poisoning are raising concern about the ""invisible killer"" this holiday travel season. On Christmas Day, a family of four from Massachusetts was found dead inside their New Hampshire vacation home; at least one of the deaths has been attributed to carbon monoxide poisoning. And on Friday, model and actress Dayle Haddon, 76, was found dead inside a Pennsylvania home owned by her daughter, Ryan Haddon, a former journalist, and her son-in-law, actor Marc Blucas. Police said on Saturday that they believe ""a faulty flue and exhaust pipe on a gas heating system"" led to a carbon monoxide leak, according to CBS News. A 76-year-old man — later identified as Walter J. Blucas — was also hospitalized after being discovered unconscious in the home. Each year in the United States, more than 100,000 people visit the emergency department due to accidental carbon monoxide, or CO, poisoning, and at least 400 people die from unintentional CO poisoning that isn't fire-related, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Here’s what you need to know about this dangerous gas. Carbon monoxide, also known as the “invisible killer,” is a colorless, odorless, tasteless gas. A byproduct of combustion, or burning, CO can leak from everyday appliances like stoves, dryers, water heaters or gas fireplaces, or from car or truck engine exhaust. Gas appliances are designed to vent CO outdoors, but if there’s a malfunction, they can leak it indoors and cause carbon monoxide poisoning. Breathing in a lot of CO can make you pass out, or kill you. Common symptoms are often flulike and include headache, dizziness, upset stomach, chest pain or confusion, but highly concentrated levels of CO can cause a person to pass out without feeling symptoms. Because CO has no smell, color or taste, it’s impossible to detect without the right equipment, but there are some signs you can look for. It’s sometimes accompanied by other exhaust gases that you can smell, so be aware of any unusual odors. If you have a fireplace, look out for fallen soot or an upward draft in the chimney flue. And take notice of any “sooty or brownish-yellow stains” near appliances. Since CO is lighter than air, it tends to gather near the ceiling. So CO detectors should be installed in each floor of your home at least 5 feet above ground — ideally near sleeping areas and in the same room as gas- or wood-burning appliances — and tested once a month, according to the U.S. Fire Administration. Also make sure that home heating equipment is inspected annually, including gas appliances and chimneys. To avoid carbon monoxide poisoning in your vehicle, the CDC recommends having your exhaust system checked every year, as even a small exhaust leak results in CO buildup inside a car or truck. If your vehicle has a tailgate, open the vents or windows after opening the tailgate to make sure air is moving; otherwise CO from the exhaust can be pulled into the vehicle.",355,[],2025-01-06 04:02:05,2025-01-06 19:27:46

President Biden announced that Thursday, Jan. 9, will be a national day of mourning for Carter, who will be buried next to his wife, former first lady Rosalynn Carter, who died in Nov. 2023, in a private ceremony in his hometown of Plains, Ga. Federal government executive departments and agencies will be closed on Jan. 9 in honor of Carter as well. “With his compassion and moral clarity, he worked to eradicate disease, forge peace, advance civil rights and human rights, promote free and fair elections, house the homeless and always advocate for the least among us. He saved, lifted and changed the lives of people all across the globe,” Biden said of Carter, the longest-lived U.S. president, on Sunday. Carter’s state funeral is scheduled to be held in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 9. In honor of Carter, Biden ordered the flags at every government building across the country to be flown at half-staff for the next 30 days. After a former president dies, the current president works with the Defense Department to plan a state funeral that typically lasts seven to 10 days and is open for U.S. residents to participate in or watch. State funerals usually have three stages, according to the Joint Task Force-National Capital Region (JTF-NCR), which is a military unit that plans, supports and executes military support within the U.S. capital region and oversees state funerals. These stages include ceremonies in the state where the former president lived, in Washington, D.C., and in the state where the former president has said they want to be buried. State funerals aren’t limited to former presidents. Rather, they are planned “on behalf of all persons who hold, or have held, the office of president as well as a president-elect and other persons designated by the president.” The last former president to die was George H.W. Bush in 2018. His state funeral was held at the Washington National Cathedral, where over 3,000 political leaders and family members congregated. Carter was in attendance, along with former presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and then-President Donald Trump. The first stage of state funerals is a ceremony held where the former president lived. Carter is first expected to lie in repose on Jan. 4 and 5 at the Carter Center, a humanitarian organization in Atlanta that was founded by the Carters. On Jan. 6, he will be transported to Washington, D.C., for the second stage of the state funeral. He is expected to lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda so people can walk in and pay their respects. The first president to lie in state at the Capitol was Abraham Lincoln in 1865, and the most recent was Bush in 2018. On Jan. 9, Carter’s state funeral will be held at the Washington National Cathedral. In 2023, while Carter was in hospice care, Biden said the former president had asked him to give a eulogy at his funeral. Finally, Carter will be returned to Georgia for a private ceremony in Plains, where he will be buried next to his wife. World leaders and former presidents are expected to attend Carter’s funeral services. In 2018, former presidents Clinton, Bush, Obama and Trump, along with their spouses, all attended Bush’s funeral ceremony in Washington. Biden has announced that flags will be flown at half-staff in honor of Carter through most of January, including on Jan. 20, when President-elect Trump will be inaugurated.

How the former president challenged common misconceptions about end-of-life care.,,Health,Yahoo Life,5 min read,"The former president, who died Sunday at age 100, began hospice care in 2023.",Rebecca CoreyReporter,2024-12-30T15:08:48.000Z,"Former President Jimmy Carter, who died on Sunday in his hometown of Plains, Ga., had defied expectations since entering hospice care at his home in February 2023. Although homages began to roll in when Carter began end-of-life care at age 98, the longest-living U.S. president went on to live for nearly two more years and celebrated several milestones, including marking his 100th birthday on Oct. 1 and participating in his final presidential election by casting a vote for Kamala Harris. While Carter's lengthy hospice experience may be unusual, experts say it's not unheard of. “It is common for hospice patients to aspire to live long enough for landmark birthdays or family events,” Angela Novas, chief medical officer of the Hospice Foundation of America, who was not involved in Carter’s care, tells Yahoo Life, “and hospice care will do everything in its power to make sure you are present for those milestones.” Carter’s story cast a new and perhaps more optimistic light on hospice — a phase of end-of-life care that many experts say is often misunderstood. Here’s what to know. When Carter first entered hospice care, Yahoo Life spoke with Dr. Sunita Puri, program director of the Hospice and Palliative Medicine Fellowship program at the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School and author of That Good Night: Life and Medicine in the Eleventh Hour. She said she likes to think of hospice as “intensive comfort-focused care” that’s “provided with the goal of minimizing the physical, emotional and spiritual suffering that patients and their families experience when somebody has six months or less to live.” Most hospice care takes place at home, but it can also be provided at a nursing facility or a standalone hospice facility. Dr. Phillip Rodgers, a palliative care specialist and chair of the University of Michigan Department of Family Medicine, tells Yahoo Life that while hospice is available for at least the last six months of a person’s life, most people receive hospice for much shorter periods of time. According to the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, the median length of stay in hospice is 18 days, and 75% of hospice recipients receive fewer than 90 days — with even shorter stays among people in Black, Latinx and Indigenous communities. “There are some individuals — like President Carter — who are enrolled in hospice for much longer, but they are few in number,” Rodgers says. Carter’s wife, former first lady Rosalynn Carter, was in hospice care for only a few days before dying in November 2023. Still, Dr. Kathleen Unroe, a research scientist at the Indiana University Center for Aging Research, points out that 10% of people are enrolled in hospice for more than 264 days. And Novas says that while Carter’s hospice stay was longer than the typical hospice patient, his length of stay isn’t without precedent. “Hospice admission requirements, which are based on the Medicare hospice benefit, require an anticipated prognosis of six months or less — meaning that doctors must believe you will die within six months if your disease runs its anticipated course. But nobody can predict that with 100% certainty,” she says. “If hospice patients outlive their initial six-month hospice benefit period, they can continue to receive care so long as the hospice medical team determines that eligibility requirements are met.” Dr. R. Sean Morrison, chair for the Brookdale Department of Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, tells Yahoo Life that one reason hospice stays are often shorter is that it can be hard for people to admit that it’s time to start that next phase of care. “People are afraid of hospice and what that means — that if you're entering hospice, then there's a recognition that you're dying,” he says. “And that can be very, very difficult for both patients and physicians.” In addition to length of stay, experts say there's a lot that people get wrong about hospice care. Myth 1: Hospice is for people who have “given up.” A top misconception that people have about hospice, according to end-of-life experts, is that it means people have “given up” on their own care or their loved one’s care. “In fact, hospice is very often the opposite, and actually increases the amount of care and support available, especially for patients living at home or in home-like settings such as independent and assisted living,” Rodgers says. Myth 2: Hospice care is for people with days to live. As Carter demonstrated, patients may have weeks or months to live. Myth 3: Hospice care involves 24/7 bedside care by medical professionals. In fact, “the bulk of the day-to-day caregiving responsibilities remain with the family [or] private caregivers or nursing home staff,” Novas explains. Morrison adds that one of the biggest misconceptions he hears is that hospice is a place as opposed to a form of care. “[People think] that when they go on hospice, they're going to go into a building to die. And the reality is, overwhelmingly, by statute, 80% of care in hospice has to be delivered in a home,” he says. Myth 4: Hospice accelerates the dying process. Hospice care doesn’t involve life-prolonging therapies or aggressive treatment, but “the hospice philosophy is to provide comfort and compassionate care for people living with terminal illness, for however long that may be,” Novas says. Myth 5: Hospice is only for cancer patients. Novas says hospice care is for people “with a wide range of diagnoses.” Novas adds that Carter’s public disclosure about beginning hospice care ignited conversations about end-of-life care — and helped dispel some of those persistent myths. “As a nation, we watched him attend his wife Rosalynn’s funeral and participate in other events, all while receiving hospice care,” Novas says. “Mr. Carter has played a large role in helping dispel the myth that hospice is only for people whose death is imminent. What he has done to raise awareness of hospice care will undoubtedly be part of his legacy.” This article was originally published on Aug. 9, 2024, and has been updated.",2.9k,[],2025-01-06 04:02:05,2025-01-06 19:27:46

But first: What do these terms, generally used by Gen Z-ers and millennials, even mean? “‘Brain rotting’ typically refers to the idea of engaging in mindless content consumption, like scrolling social media or binge-watching TV shows, which over time, feels like numbing or dulling your brain,” explains mental health therapist Brittany Cilento Kopycienski, who owns Glow Counseling Solutions. “‘Bed rotting’ involves spending excessive time lying in bed, contributing to physical and mental stagnation.” Both activities, it seems, are about checking out of whatever your reality is at the moment — and checking into the often good feeling of doing nothing. Is that good for our mental health? Here's what experts say. “Let’s face it—bed rotting or brain rotting is not a style of lazy living. It’s about escape,” psychologist Caitlin Slavens tells Yahoo Life. “The world is noisy, chaotic and often overwhelming. ‘Rotting’ is like pressing a giant snooze button on life. When you’re inundated with expectations (of work, family or even yourself), shutting down might seem your only option.” She adds, “These trends are a response to a world that’s made us feel like we must be performing in every moment of our lives — for work, for social media, for each other’s expectations. The rise of rotting says we’re burnt out, together.” That may be especially true for younger adults. “Our brains are experiencing unprecedented levels of stimulation through constant notifications, social media and digital engagement,"" Sophia Spencer, a social psychology and mental health therapist, tells Yahoo Life. ""For Gen Z and millennials in particular, they are the first generations to live like this from a young age and for this to be their norm. Essentially, their brains are subject to a level of information that was once unthinkable, and not what our brains are designed for.” But others argue that this urge to disassociate from life isn't new, but rather something past generations have also felt as they settle into adulthood. “Do you remember the ‘adulting' movement?"" Slavens points out. ""People began to celebrate even the most basic life tasks, like doing laundry or paying bills, as if they were a win in a world so large it felt overwhelming. Or hygge — the Scandinavian midcentury concept of warm living — where we all collectively agreed that it was candles and blankets we needed to feel better when burned out. ""All of these trends speak to the same need: to ease up, to take a breath, to feel fine about not doing it all.” It really depends on the intention behind it — and how much time is being spent staring at screens in lieu of actually resting. Many people see bed rotting as a particular form of self-care: a day spent in bed, with a sole focus on recharging. “Our brains are not meant to be on overdrive all the time. Intentional breaks, time away from screens and the permission to veg out can be restorative,” says Slavens. “The issue is when rotting turns into avoidance, when we’re evading responsibilities or feelings we’re afraid to confront. So yes, a little rotting? Great. Full-blown decay? Probably not ideal.” As for “brain rot,” who among us hasn’t mindlessly scrolled on our phone? “‘Rotting’ in moderation can be seen as a chance to mentally reset,” says Kopycienski. “It can allow for a break from constant stimulation where emotional recovery can occur.” Thinking all this rotting through, the long and short of it seems to be that it’s about burnout. And burnout isn’t best handled by festering, or rotting; it’s best handled via intentional rest, experts say. ""The best thing we can do is redefine what rest looks like in a digital age,"" says Spencer. ""Rather than reactively rotting, [we should be] having a system of proactive healthy habits."" That might involve proactively setting better work-life boundaries, scaling back our commitments or being less online to minimize burnout in the first place. Spencer doesn't rule out more radical change. ""When our ancestors went through significant social change, such as during the Industrial Revolution, people moved from agricultural rhythms that followed daylight to the factory 9–5 schedule,"" she notes. ""I think we need to take the digital age as a significant change to our life ... and adapt our lives ourselves as appropriate.”",2.5k,[],2025-01-06 04:02:05,2025-01-06 19:27:46

But is it healthy?",,Health,Yahoo Life,3 min read,"Are there actual upsides to wearing socks to bed, beyond toastier toes? Here’s what experts say.",Eileen Bailey,2024-12-30T10:00:45.000Z,"Some people find sleeping in socks cozy and soothing, while others like the warmth socks provide in the winter but find them intolerable during the summer. Still others hate the idea of wearing socks to bed with a passion, with some going as far as calling it “psychopathic behavior.” The truth is, it’s hard to get comfortable when your feet are cold. But are there actual upsides to wearing socks in bed, beyond toastier toes? Here’s what experts want you to know. It might surprise you to discover that there are some specific benefits of sleeping with socks on. ""It can help improve circulation, maintain body temperature and possibly improve sleep quality,"" Dr. Neal H. Patel, family medicine physician with Providence St. Joseph Hospital, Orange County, Calif., tells Yahoo Life. As you get sleepy, the core temperature of the body lowers, according to the Sleep Foundation. Warming your feet by putting on socks can result in helping your body cool down through vasodilation of blood vessels, says Dr. Alex Dimitriu, double board-certified in psychiatry and sleep medicine and the founder of Menlo Park Psychiatry & Sleep Medicine, in Northern California. And this can help improve your sleep quality. ""As the body temperature drops during sleep, people enter deeper stages of sleep,"" he tells Yahoo Life. Dimitriu suggests experimenting. ""Given the ease of the socks for a sleep experiment, it's worth a shot,” he says. “Consider monitoring sleep with a tracker to get objective data."" Although some find wearing socks in bed decidedly unsexy, it may also improve your sex life. One small, older study conducted at the University of Groningen found that when couples wore socks during intimacy, about 80% of the couples achieved orgasm compared with 50% without socks. That may be because wearing socks to bed can help improve circulation. ""I think socks might help for orgasm too,” Dimitriu says. ""Socks may help improve blood flow to erogenous zones as well, which may be a desirable side effect.” He adds: “I can't promise it will work, but why not try to lean on the placebo effect in this case?"" Not everyone should wear socks to bed, which is why experts recommend that people with certain medical conditions, including diabetes, speak with their doctor first. ""Those prone to ingrown nails may want to check with their doctor since tight or warm socks can potentially increase their risk of an ingrown nail,"" explains Patel. ""Those with diabetes, foot infections or fever should also consult their doctor before wearing socks."" Other risks include constricting circulation if the socks are too tight, along with “certain hygiene issues if someone has excess sweating from their feet, which can affect the skin and the nails,” says Patel, adding: “Some of the qualities of socks can cause skin irritation. Overheating can be another issue if the socks are too warm or not breathable."" The best socks for sleeping are ones that are breathable and have moisture-wicking fibers, such as merino wool and cashmere, says Dimitriu. Some socks are marketed as ""sleep socks,"" but those aren’t necessary. Sleep socks are typically thick and loose and most of all comfortable — they should be well-fitted but not so tight that they restrict blood flow. You shouldn’t wear compression socks in bed unless prescribed by your doctor, as they can block blood flow, especially when lying down. Other factors to keep in mind: Try to change your socks every night and stay on top of foot hygiene, such as by washing your feet. Some find socks help them sleep better, while others find them uncomfortable. Regardless of where you stand on sleeping in socks, Dimitriu says: ""Generally, a cool bedroom and light, breathable sheets that let the body cool down at night will help everyone sleep more soundly.""",519,[],2025-01-06 04:02:05,2025-01-06 19:27:46

But in recent years, Carter’s one-term presidency has been reevaluated, and a more balanced view of his time in office has emerged. Here are the highs and lows of the time in office of the nation’s 39th president. Panamanian resentment of a U.S. presence was destabilizing Central America in the 1960s and 1970s, a threat to U.S. soldiers stationed there, and hurtful to the United States' status in the region. Meanwhile, Republicans like former California Gov. Ronald Reagan — before he ran for president in 1980 — were criticizing Carter for negotiating a treaty to give the territory back to Panama. See for yourself — The Yodel is the go-to source for daily news, entertainment and feel-good stories. By signing up, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Policy. Carter was criticized by Republicans for pushing the treaty through, but got the deal done. Carter took office in 1977 with inflation cooling down to around 6%, down from a very problematic 12% a few years earlier. But then in 1979, it took off again, taking the price of goods and borrowing along with it. By the end of 1979, inflation was at 13%, and by 1980, interest rates for a car or home loan were around 19%. It was a brutal burden on the middle class and working poor, and Carter could not get it under control. Carter’s appointment of Paul Volcker as chairman of the Federal Reserve, in 1979, is credited with bringing down inflation over the next few years. However, high inflation was one reason American voters were ready to switch presidents in 1980. In the fall of 1978, Carter brought Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin together at Camp David, in the hills of northern Maryland. Their two countries had gone to war twice in the previous decade, and Egypt did not recognize Israel’s right to exist. For 13 days in September 1978, Carter kept the leaders of Israel and Egypt at Camp David, even as the American president’s own domestic challenges mounted. At the end of this time, through dogged persistence, Carter managed to get Sadat and Begin to sign a peace agreement that has endured to this day, nearly half a century later. In addition to high prices for groceries and bank loans, foreign conflicts created a strain on the U.S. oil supply, and Americans grew panicky about their ability to fill up their cars. They stocked up on so much gas that filling stations ran out. Lines of cars formed. Rationing plans were implemented. People got angry and even violent. There were shootings, and stabbings, and even a mass riot in Levittown, Pa., in late June of 1979. Carter, in early July, disappeared inside the presidential retreat at Camp David. He took meetings with all kinds of American leaders and citizens for 10 days, and then gave a speech to the nation on July 15, 1979, which was initially hailed by pundits as a stroke of brilliance. But Carter squandered his momentum when he asked for the resignations of his entire Cabinet two days after the speech and accepted five of them. Carter’s advisers told him it would be a show of strength, but instead it was interpreted as a sign of panic. Carter’s address came to be known as the “malaise” speech, even though he’d never uttered the word. Carter was from the Deep South, and had run a campaign for Georgia governor in 1970 that appealed to white supremacist factions in that state. But once in office, he increased the racial diversity of Georgia’s government workforce. And as president, Carter greatly increased the number of women and minorities in federal judgeships. It has been hailed in recent years as one of his greatest accomplishments. On Nov. 4, 1979, supporters of Iran’s Islamist government in Tehran seized the U.S. Embassy and took more than 50 Americans hostage. Carter resisted the impulse to go to war with Iran, and tried to resolve the crisis peacefully. He did eventually authorize a military attempt to rescue the hostages in April of 1980, but that backfired: A U.S. military helicopter collided with a U.S. transport plane during the operation, killing eight American soldiers and injuring four others. Carter was unable to get most of the hostages released during his presidency (13 were released during his time in office), despite his frantic efforts after he lost the 1980 election to Reagan. The hostages were released minutes after Reagan was inaugurated, thanks in large part to the efforts of Carter and his administration. For all the critiques of Carter as weak, he increased the U.S. defense budget. This is one reason Carter has been credited by top defense officials with hastening the demise of the Soviet Union, because its attempts to keep pace put the communist regime on the road to insolvency. The other reason some give Carter credit for helping to bring down the Soviet Union is that he made human rights the centerpiece of his foreign policy. This challenged “the legitimacy of the Soviet government,” according to Robert Gates, who served as defense secretary for President Barack Obama and President George W. Bush. Carter’s focus on human rights also greatly improved U.S. prestige abroad. In the spring of 1979, Carter told White House press secretary Jody Powell a story about how, several days before, he’d swatted an animal away from his canoe while fishing in a pond on his farm in Georgia. Months later, Powell passed the story on to a reporter with the Associated Press, who wrote what Powell called a “lighthearted” piece about the encounter. But the Washington Post turned it into a front-page scandal of sorts, headlining its article “President attacked by rabbit.” The major TV networks ran with the story as well. And although no photo of the incident was provided at the time (it was released years later), the silly incident helped solidify the caricature of a weak president.",987,[],2025-01-06 04:02:05,2025-01-06 19:09:18

But Carter accepted that the intersection of faith and politics would involve compromise and moral complexity.,Jon WardChief National Correspondent,2024-12-29T21:37:25.000Z,"The low point of Jimmy Carter’s life came in 1966, and it was then that he recommitted himself to his Christian faith. Carter — who died on Sunday at the age of 100 — was a 42-year-old state senator from Georgia, and he was at a personal crossroads. He’d made a bid for governor and lost, coming in third out of six candidates. He’d gone deep into debt to finance the campaign. And he was horrified that an avowed white supremacist, Lester Maddox, had been elected governor, in part because Carter had split the moderate vote with another candidate. Carter was “profoundly depressed,” according to adviser Peter Bourne. He told a friend he questioned if he’d “ever amount to much.” He was also “disillusioned about [his] religious faith,” his biographer Jonathan Alter wrote. See for yourself — The Yodel is the go-to source for daily news, entertainment and feel-good stories. By signing up, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Policy. But out of the depths of Carter’s despair, he sought — and found — a newly enlivened faith. He would eventually describe himself as having become a “born again” Christian, a popular term in the late 1960s and into the 1970s. Carter’s religious devotion would animate his action for the rest of his life. But it was not a simple faith. It was after his loss in 1966 that Carter was introduced to the writings of Reinhold Niebuhr, a Protestant theologian and intellectual who was a powerful voice in mid-century America. Niebuhr espoused what he called “Christian realism.” His writings became what Carter called his “political bible.” At the heart of Christian realism was the view that utopianism from the left or right was doomed to fail, that human nature was inherently fallible, and that — as Niebuhr said — “man is the kind of lion who both kills the lamb and dreams of when the lion and the lamb shall lie down together.” Or as Carter put it: “We live in a world that is imperfect and which will always be imperfect — a world that is complex and confused and which will always be complex and confused.” And so, in political action, Carter would say: “We must always combine realism with principle,” Bourne wrote in his 1997 biography of Carter. Bourne admired Carter but expressed concern that this political philosophy was a temptation to justify by-any-means-necessary politics. “His absolute determination to win became less a troubling matter of egotistical ambition and now more a prerequisite for fulfilling the commitment he had made to carry out God’s work,” Bourne wrote. Carter put this philosophy into practice right away. He ran for governor again in 1970. He knew that in order to win, he could not alienate voters who supported or had sympathy for segregationist political figures, such as George Wallace. Wallace was the former Alabama governor who had run as a moderate on racial issues in 1958 and lost, and then committed himself to a racist platform in the 1962 election, which he then won. He became a national symbol of white supremacism in 1963 when he physically blocked National Guard troops from escorting Black students into a building on the University of Alabama campus. Carter’s own trajectory in Georgia followed a similar pattern. He’d lost the 1966 election running on a moderate platform. In 1970, Carter was careful not to make the same mistake. He made some overtures to Black voters, but at the same time, his campaign distributed flyers to white voters showing his opponent Carl Sanders — a part owner of Atlanta’s professional basketball team — having champagne poured over his head by a Black member of the team. Carter also criticized Sanders for blocking George Wallace from speaking on state property and said that, if elected governor, he would invite Wallace to address the state Legislature. Carter also sought endorsements from some of the most well-known segregationists in Georgia, and signaled to white parents that he’d support their right to keep children in private schools that discriminated against Black students. In a 2015 interview, Carter was sanguine about the campaign when I asked him about it. “I never made a racist statement,” he told me. “But I did get the more conservative country votes there in Georgia, because I never did anything to alienate them.” But at the time, when the campaign was over and Carter had won, top aide Hamilton Jordan observed that the triumphant governor-elect was glum and “didn’t seem the least bit excited about it.” Others observed the same, and speculated that Carter was upset about the lengths his campaign had gone to in order to win. In his inauguration speech, Carter told his audience that “the test of a man is not how well he campaigned, but how effectively he meets the challenges and responsibilities of the office.” These were notes of both remorse and justification. And then Carter said, “I say to you quite frankly that the time for racial discrimination is over.” The white establishment reeled in horror. Some segregationist state senators walked out before Carter’s speech was over. But Carter followed through. As governor, he rapidly expanded the number of Black appointees to state boards and commissions from three to 55. And he appointed the first person of color to a senior state government post. As president, Carter continued this legacy. He greatly diversified the federal judiciary and bureaucracy. And he pushed for the passage of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which cut down on discrimination against racial minorities by lenders. One of Carter’s most famous speeches in office came at the end of his governorship, in 1974, when the writer Hunter S. Thompson watched him excoriate the Georgia legal establishment for its lack of progress on reforming the criminal justice system. “Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. — who was perhaps despised by many in this room because he shook up our social structure that benefited us, and demanded simply that Black citizens be treated the same as white citizens — wasn’t greeted with approbation and accolades by the Georgia Bar Association or the Alabama Bar Association. He was greeted with horror,” Carter told the room of shocked lawyers and judges. “Still, once that change was made, a very simple but difficult change, no one in his right mind would want to go back to circumstances prior to that juncture in the development of our nation’s society.” Appealing to racist voters in order to uproot and reverse racist policies was certainly one way to be a “Christian realist.” But not all of Carter’s political action was so morally fraught. He was the first U.S. president to make support for universal human rights a cornerstone of foreign policy. This was motivated by Carter’s beliefs, but it also paid pragmatic and strategic dividends. National security officials such as Robert Gates, who served as defense secretary under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, credited Carter’s bold stance with helping the U.S. win the Cold War, in addition to his increases in military spending. Carter faced an intense political backlash from conservatives for signing a 1977 treaty that would transfer control of the Panama Canal to Panama. But, again, Carter saw the issue as both moral and strategic. Carter felt the Panama Canal Treaty of 1903 was unfair to the small Central American nation — as did the Panamanians — and wanted to right past wrongs. But maintaining U.S. control of the vital waterway also had caused violent unrest that cost the lives of American soldiers and civilian Panamanians. After Carter won the presidency in 1976, the outgoing president, Gerald Ford, told him that resolving this crisis was a top priority. Carter’s advisers told him he should wait until his second term to fix this problem. But, Carter told his wife, Rosalynn, “Suppose there is no second term?” His determination to solve the issue “prevented a major war in Central America,” Alter wrote. Similarly, at home, the Carter administration cracked down on the tax status of private schools that discriminated against Black students, even though this action galvanized large blocks of religious conservatives to vote for the Republican Party. In fact, it was this issue that some historians say helped create a lasting loyalty and attachment between the religious right and the GOP. After leaving office, Carter reinvented the post-presidency. He created the Carter Center in Atlanta to alleviate disease and poverty, provide a forum for conflict resolution, and promote and protect democratic elections around the world. The work of the Carter Center was instrumental in effectively eradicating the guinea worm, a debilitating parasite that had long tormented much of Africa. As an ex-president, Carter also negotiated a ceasefire in the Balkans. In 1994, President Bill Clinton sent him as an emissary to North Korea, which helped keep peace on the peninsula. That same year, he assisted in averting a U.S. invasion of Haiti. And he continued to teach Sunday school twice a month in his small-town church in Plains, Ga., into his late 90s. Tourists would sleep in their cars in the parking lot on Saturday to get a spot in the crowded sanctuary on Sunday morning. “In these troubled times today, he is like a beacon of light,” said Jeanie Miglis, who was first in line with her husband, Mitch, when Yahoo News visited Maranatha Baptist Church in the summer of 2019. “He represents good morals; he represents hope and peace.” This is how Carter was widely seen at the end of his life. But his path to that place was marked by a faith that accepted compromise and moral complexity as part of the bargain.",1k,[],2025-01-06 04:02:05,2025-01-06 20:05:08

During his one term in the White House, he decreased the budget deficit, became a trailblazer for green energy, negotiated the Panama Canal treaties, brokered the peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, created millions of jobs and the Education Department, brought diversity to the federal bench and diverted a nuclear disaster. But his struggle to suppress rising inflation and interest rates, as well as the diplomatic standoff of the Iranian hostage crisis, contributed to his loss to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 election. In 2002, Carter became the third president to win the Nobel Peace Prize for his work, both during and after his presidency, in helping to resolve international conflicts, advancing social welfare and campaigning for human rights. After Carter lost reelection, he and Rosalynn moved back to Plains, lived in a modest home and were commonly spotted by the town's hundreds of residents. From there, Carter helped to build, renovate and repair 4,300 homes in a long-lasting relationship with Habitat for Humanity, as well as raising funding for construction. Well into his 90s, Carter could be seen teaching Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist Church, where he was a devoted member for decades.

He died on Sunday afternoon in Plains, Ga., the Carter Center said. Leaders who reach the pinnacle of power are usually complicated individuals. But Carter was a man whose outward image was often the opposite of what lay underneath. He strove to convey simplicity and humility, yet he was a highly sophisticated man with ego and ambition that burned hotter than most. “Don’t pay any attention to that smile. That don’t mean a thing,” said Ben Fortson, Georgia’s secretary of state for a period of 33 years that included Carter’s tenure as governor. “That man is made of steel, determination and stubbornness.” See for yourself — The Yodel is the go-to source for daily news, entertainment and feel-good stories. By signing up, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Policy. Carter’s own wife, Rosalynn, once said that her husband “appears kind of meek or something. People always underestimate him.” Carter has been widely considered an unsuccessful president who was overwhelmed by events. And compared with the presidencies of, say, Johnson, Nixon or Reagan, Carter’s single term is a period that historians and the public showed very little interest in revisiting, though that began to shift in his last few years. Yet he lived a compelling, exemplary life, and he was beset by challenges in office that would have stymied most leaders. During Carter’s term, he was unable to resolve the major problems that confronted America in the late 1970s. He could not tame inflation or unite the Democratic Party, and he couldn’t free the Americans who were held captive in Iran for more than a year. It’s not well known, however, that the agreement that led to freedom for the 52 American hostages in Tehran was negotiated by Carter and his administration during his final weeks in office. Ronald Reagan had little if anything to do with it, even though he is commonly given credit, since the Iranians released the hostages moments after he was inaugurated. In 1979 Carter appointed Paul Volcker as chairman of the Federal Reserve; Volcker’s policies brought down inflation, which was running in double digits by the end of the decade, though it took time for that to happen, and Reagan reaped the political benefits. Some critiques of the Volcker appointment have come from the left, who said his policies benefitted Wall Street at the expense of the working class. Reagan is also given all the credit for the fall of the Soviet Union and communism. But Carter’s one-two punch — he increased defense spending and made human rights a core plank of American foreign policy — put pressure on the Soviets fiscally and morally, and Carter has been credited for forcing the USSR onto an unsustainable trajectory. It was Carter’s style that rubbed many Americans the wrong way. When Teddy Kennedy decided to run against him in 1980, challenging the incumbent president of his own party, he made Carter’s lack of leadership his central argument. ""Only the president can provide the sense of direction needed by the nation,"" Kennedy said when he announced his candidacy in November 1979. ""For many months, we have been sinking into crisis, yet we hear no clear summons from the center of power.” Over the years, Carter has been commonly remembered as a kind of Mister Rogers figure, a soft-spoken man wearing a sweater who was good but not strong. Yet Carter’s strength was on display all his life. He grew up in rural poverty and worked his way into the Naval Academy. He had few political connections in Georgia and yet willed his way to the governorship. And he won the presidency with few insider party credentials. And then, after a devastating and overwhelming loss to Reagan in 1980, Carter revolutionized what it means to be an ex-president. He won the release of political prisoners around the world, resolved conflicts in war zones, monitored elections in fledgling democracies and helped eradicate disease. He wrote or published more than 30 books in the years after his presidency, including a novel (the first by a U.S. president), a book of poetry, a children’s book, a book on fishing and other outdoor sporting activities, two on making the most of older years (one of which he co-wrote with Rosalynn), a few on the Middle East, a few personal history books focused on different periods of his life, and a handful of religious devotional books. And finally, he remained married to Rosalynn for 77 years — until her death in 2023 — and he lived to the age of 100. Carter’s father and his three siblings had all died in their 50s or early 60s of pancreatic cancer, and yet he overcame brain cancer at age 90. He never lost his intense zeal for life. He certainly wasn’t overly nice. In fact, one of the biggest criticisms of Carter during the 1980 campaign against Reagan was that Carter was too mean. He consistently, throughout his political career, made the mistake of personally attacking his opponents in ways that backfired with the electorate. He painted Reagan as an unstable warmonger and said that if the Republican were elected, “Americans might be separated, Black from white, Jew from Christian, North from South, rural from urban.” Carter had, in fact, made a deliberate decision at the beginning of his political career — which consumed less than a fifth of his entire life — that he could participate in the morally nebulous world of campaigns and governance and still retain his personal integrity. He once compared being a state senator to being a pastor with 80,000 parishioners. He was deeply influenced by Christian theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, who wrote that “man is the kind of lion who both kills the lamb and dreams of when the lion and the lamb shall lie down together.” Carter called a collection of Niebuhr’s essays his “political bible.” Jimmy Carter was born Oct. 1, 1924, in a small local hospital in the southwest Georgia town of Plains. He was the first U.S. president born in a hospital. Carter was the first child of James Earl Carter, a World War I veteran and an industrious peanut farmer, and Lillian Carter, a nurse. He would become known as the “man from Plains,” but he actually grew up in a place called Archery, 2.5 miles west of Plains. This was Carter’s term for it: not a town or a village, but a “place.” Archery “was never quite a real town,” Carter wrote. It’s no longer even on any maps. But “it’s where I grew up,” he said. There was no running water in Carter’s home until he was 9 years old, and he and his family would relieve themselves either in one of the “slop jars” that were in each of the three bedrooms or out back in the outdoor privy. They did not have toilet paper. When his father bought a small windmill in 1935, it powered a toilet, a sink and a rudimentary shower. The showerhead was a can with holes poked in it. Electricity would not arrive on most farms until President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Rural Electrification Administration made headway, so artificial light came from kerosene lamps. And until the 1940s, the farming process in the Deep South was largely the same as during colonial times nearly 200 years before. Tractors or any form of mechanized power were rare, so plowing was done with mules. Harvesting was done by hand and depended on manual labor, usually from Black tenant workers who lived in shacks on the farm property in exchange for a job, and who had little prospect of ever earning much money. The Southern farm population actually grew from 1930 to 1935, as city workers lost jobs and moved to places like Archery. Carter’s father, Earl, owned 350 acres. It was a good-sized farm, especially since many other family estates were in a multi-decade process of being subdivided by descendants of Southern plantation owners after the Civil War. And Earl made the most of it. He was smart, thrifty, and a good businessman. Earl could be stoic and restrained, and was sometimes severe. The family did not speak at the dinner table, although they were allowed to bring books to read while they ate. Jimmy strove to please his father and rarely felt he succeeded. But he had a happy childhood, roaming through creeks and forests with friends, shirtless and shoeless. But he also engaged in demanding physical labor from a young age. He picked cotton alongside field hands. He learned how to guide the mules in plowing the fields. He had two younger sisters, Gloria and Ruth. His only brother, Billy, was not born until Jimmy was 12 years old. Earl Carter’s politics were segregationist and white supremacist, as were most white Georgians’ at the time. But Jimmy’s mother, Lillian, was a progressive on racial questions from a young age. Earl “was tolerant if not supportive of Lillian’s views,” Carter wrote in “Turning Point,” his 1992 memoir of growing up in Georgia. Earl was “above all, a Talmadge man,” meaning he was a devoted supporter of Eugene Talmadge, the arch-segregationist governor of Georgia in the 1930s and ’40s. When Earl died in 1953, Jimmy was a naval officer stationed in Schenectady, N.Y., on a track that would have put him in position to potentially take command of a nuclear submarine in the near future. But he abandoned his naval career to come home and take over his parents’ farm, overriding Rosalynn’s strong opposition to the move. He ran for state Senate in 1962. A corrupt local official stood in a polling place telling residents how to vote, intimidating Carter supporters and stuffing the ballot box. Yet Carter mounted a drive to have the vote recounted and the corruption investigated. He succeeded, largely thanks to a series of articles in the Atlanta Journal, and was seated in the legislature. When his church, the First Baptist Church in Plains, voted in the summer of 1964 to formalize its practice of preventing Black worshippers from attending services, Carter stood and spoke against the resolution. Many in the congregation abstained from voting out of fear, but of those who did vote, only Carter’s family and one other farmer opposed the proposal. It passed 54 to 6. He was not outspoken on some racial hot-button issues. But he pointedly refused to join the segregationist White Citizens Council, despite threats and intimidation. Carter ran for governor in 1966 but came in third in the Democratic primary, behind former Gov. Ellis Arnall and Lester Maddox, a committed segregationist who won a runoff with Arnall and then the governorship in the fall. Carter turned his attention quickly to running for governor again in 1970. He also experienced an existential crisis at the age of 42, questioning the direction and meaning of his life. He began reading the Bible more closely and questioning how his faith applied to modern life and to politics. During this time, Carter discovered Niebuhr. He traveled with three other men to Lock Haven, Pa., a coal-mining town in the center of the state, to proselytize for a new Southern Baptist church that was coming to the town. He spent 10 days knocking on doors. At each home, Carter or another man would talk about their personal faith in Jesus Christ and invite anyone interested to nightly services that they organized at the local YMCA. Carter later described his time in Lock Haven as a “miracle.” It was, he said, “where I first experienced in a personal and intense way the presence of the Holy Spirit in my life.” This was an early precursor to the “born again” dynamic of Christians in the 1970s whose revivals created the “Jesus movement.” In his 1970 campaign against former Gov. Carl Sanders, Carter sought the support of African American pastors and had the endorsement of Martin Luther King Jr. But his campaign also made covert appeals to white bigotry. Campaign aides distributed fliers with a photo of Sanders, a part owner of the Atlanta Hawks, celebrating a victory with a Black player, Lou Hudson. Carter also made numerous overtures to supporters of Alabama Gov. George Wallace, one of the staunchest defenders of segregation, and attracted the support of the most notorious white supremacists in Georgia. “I never made a racist statement,” Carter told me in a 2015 interview. “But I did get the more conservative country votes there in Georgia because I never did anything to alienate them.” In his inaugural speech in 1971, Carter recast himself once again as a racial progressive. “I say to you quite frankly that the time for racial discrimination is over,” he said. To the Black leaders in Georgia he promised, “You’re going to like me as governor.” Carter’s main achievement as governor was a major reorganization of the state government, to consolidate agencies and introduce more efficiency. But his limitations as an executive were already clear during his time in Atlanta. He had no use or appreciation for the human and relational side of politics, which is crucial to working with a legislature. “He had very few personal relationships, in my opinion,” said Bert Lance, a friend and adviser who ran Georgia’s powerful transportation department under Carter. “I like people. I like to be around them. I try to be cordial to them. Not that he doesn’t, but he’d just rather be by himself.” E. Stanly Godbold noted in his biography of Carter that during his time as governor, “Apart from Rosalynn, he saw as few people as possible. ... Usually he ate lunch alone in his office, ordering the food from the cafeteria. ... In the afternoons he studied serious academic books about politics and society."" The first recorded instance of Carter discussing the presidency was in the summer of 1971, less than a year after he was elected governor. By the fall of 1972, he and his close circle of advisers had begun to openly talk about it and began planning for a run in 1976. Few took him seriously. When Carter first raised the topic of running for president with his mother, Lillian, she responded, “President of what?” But even before Watergate, Carter and his advisers discussed the need for “moral leadership” in the country in the wake of the Vietnam War’s divisive effect. A national leader was needed, they thought, who would be more transparent and open with the country and say things that might be unpopular. Adviser Ham Jordan argued that a Carter candidacy should “encompass and expand on the Wallace constituency and ‘populist’ philosophy by being a better qualified and more responsible alternative.” Carter would represent a “New South” and could help the Democrats hold on to their fracturing coalition, which included large swaths of the South along with big-city machines across the Rust Belt, organized labor and minorities. Carter pioneered a new approach to primaries, campaigning hard in every state, aided by young advisers who had closely studied the way the nominating system had changed, and who also understood the growing importance of television as a way to project an image that superseded political ideology. He benefited from an organized effort by Democratic activists in Florida who lobbied and pressured other Democrats to stay out of the state’s primary in 1976 to give Carter a clean one-on-one matchup against Wallace, who was running for president a fourth time and had won the primary in Florida in 1972 with 41% of the vote. Carter is remembered as an inept communicator, but in person, he converted followers with the success — and the methods — of a traveling preacher. “A strange calm came over the audience as he talked of America’s basic goodness,” Jules Witcover, a reporter for the Washington Post, observed early in the campaign. “His speeches are mostly received with a strange quietness,” Charles Mohr wrote in the New York Times. Carter said the nation’s decency had only been “temporarily obscured by the debasings perpetuated by [former President Richard] Nixon.” “I want a government that is as good, and honest, and decent, and truthful, and fair, and competent, and idealistic, and compassionate, and as filled with love as are the American people,” he said, over and over. Witcover, who compared Carter to Christian evangelist Billy Graham, called this phrase Carter’s “personal rosary” and noted that “in crowd after crowd, it worked.” The country was not only disillusioned by Nixon and Watergate. Americans were disquieted and made anxious by the rise of inflation in the early ’70s, by the energy crisis of 1973 that created lines of cars at gas stations and by a slowing economy. Wages were flatlining. Jobs were disappearing. The cost of living was going up. People may have wanted someone to redeem the country, but they also wanted someone who could restore their confidence and ease their economic pain. There were no themes to Carter’s candidacy except “faith in Jimmy Carter and the sense of hope he sought to inspire in the American people,” wrote Carter adviser Peter Bourne. Witcover picked up on this as well. “He asked of voters the same ‘leap of faith’ that is at the core of religious belief,” he wrote. The electorate was ripe for this approach, as Carter pollster Pat Caddell had discovered. Voters wanted “non ideological change and the restoration of values.” He came out of nowhere to win the Iowa caucuses, and by the time he defeated Wallace in Florida, Carter had a head of steam that carried him to the nomination. He narrowly defeated President Gerald Ford in the popular vote, 40.8 million votes to 39.1 million, and in the Electoral College, 297 to 240. It was the smallest margin of victory in electoral votes for a president since 1916. In addition, the negative tone of the campaign had taken a toll. The election saw the lowest voter turnout for a presidential race in 28 years, at only 54%. Carter entered Washington as an outsider, and the presidency without much of a mandate. He was the first presidential candidate to win control of the government while running against government. Barry Goldwater had attempted it in 1964 and was crushed. Carter told audiences in 1976 that “our government in Washington now is a horrible bureaucratic mess. It is disorganized, wasteful, has no purpose, and its policies — when they exist — are incomprehensible or devised by special interest groups with little regard for the welfare of the average American citizen.” Carter was not a part of the Washington establishment, and he was proud of it. But his outsider status left him exposed when events began to undermine him. He didn’t understand the presidency or have the help of anyone who did. Carter showed signs early on of the myopic, obsessive managerial style that would cause him trouble later. It emerged that the president would sometimes scrutinize the list of government officials scheduled to accompany him on a foreign trip and scratch out the names of those he did not think needed to come. And any staff who wanted to use the tennis court on the White House grounds had to receive permission from the president himself. “He has his eye on anything that moves,” said an aide. As the summer of 1977 arrived, there were more serious warning signs. The House had passed most of Carter’s energy plan, but polling showed declining public support for the legislation. Carter and his administration were pushing the Senate to ratify the treaty they had negotiated with Panama over transfer of the canal, but Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd was in no rush, and the right was in an uproar over the move. Former California Gov. Ronald Reagan was denouncing the Panama deal on his daily radio commentary, which reached 40 million people. And the president’s relations with the Jewish community were declining as a result of his focus on peace talks and his prickly relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin. In the fall of 1978, Carter achieved what would be the high-water mark of his presidency, drawing on all his powers of persuasion, all his determination and stubbornness, to keep Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat at the Camp David presidential retreat for 13 days, long enough for them to agree to a Middle East peace deal. But Carter’s charisma and grit weren’t doing much for the American people at home. Inflation climbed in 1978, from 6.8% at the beginning of the year to 9% in November. By May 1979, it was at 11% and still climbing, headed to 13% at the end of the year. The purchasing power of the middle class had been under strain for years, and now it was being obliterated. The economy was stuck in neutral, with the industrial sector in full collapse, roiling the middle portion of the country, where jobs and pensions had been easy to come by for years. The Soviet Union was building up its military. And there was great concern about the rise of Japan as an economic superpower. Violent crime had been increasing in the nation for over a decade, with murders doubling since 1966 to the highest point in American history in the late ’70s. In late April 1979, former Carter speechwriter James Fallows unleashed a barrage of criticism at the president in the Atlantic magazine. “For the part of his job that involves leadership, Carter's style of thought cripples him. He thinks he ‘leads’ by choosing the correct policy; but he fails to project a vision larger than the problem he is tackling at the moment,” Fallows wrote. He felt that Carter’s weakness was that he approached problems as “technical, not historical” and that he had a “lack of curiosity about how the story turned out before.” Around that same time, gas shortages caused in part by the Islamic Revolution in Iran created gas lines in parts of the country. People waited for hours to fill up, and violence began to mount. Adding to the chaos, independent truckers went on strike to protest the rising price of diesel and began blocking highways and filling stations with their rigs. There were violent attacks on truck drivers who sought to break ranks with the strikers. In late June, frustration over the gas lines and the trucker protests came to a boiling point in the Philadelphia suburb of Levittown, where widespread rioting broke out. Police arrested 200 people over two nights, and 44 officers were injured. Carter was scheduled to give an energy speech on July 5 to calm the country’s frayed nerves. But one day before the speech, he canceled it and remained at Camp David. For the first 24 hours, most of the White House staff didn’t even know what the president was doing. Eventually, he stayed there 10 days, hosting groups of governors, religious leaders, economists, members of Congress and other assorted people, talking through the nation’s challenges. He hoped to help the American people think of the energy crisis in the same way they had approached the space race with the Soviets, the same way JFK had inspired the country by setting a goal in 1961 of getting a man on the moon before the end of the decade. Carter’s eventual response became known as his notorious “malaise” speech, even though he never used the word “malaise.” The speech, in actuality, was one of the best of his presidency. It was a remarkable address that was extremely well received by the press and the public. The reason the speech is now considered a failure is because two days after he gave it, Carter — seeking to project strength and boldness — asked for the resignations of every one of his major Cabinet officers. Though he did have some long-standing frustrations with the performance or loyalty of most of these officials, the firings were mostly a political and public relations ploy conceived of and encouraged by Ham Jordan. The changes backfired horribly and came off as chaotic and weak. By the summer of 1979, polls showed Ted Kennedy leading Carter by 2 to 1 among likely Democratic voters, and the last of the Kennedy brothers was preparing to take the dramatic step of running against a president of his own party. “I’m going to whip his ass,” Carter told a group of Democratic congressmen at the White House. It didn’t look that way as Kennedy prepared to run against Carter. But then on Nov. 4 the world changed. Iranian radicals in Tehran seized the U.S. Embassy and took 66 Americans hostage. Along with a disastrous Kennedy interview with CBS News’ Roger Mudd, the hostage crisis turned Carter’s political fortunes around, and he was able to defeat Kennedy in the primary, though it was a long and costly battle. Carter’s presidency had been derailed time and again by the impression that he was powerless and inept, especially as inflation raged on and the hostage crisis dragged out. And yet as he faced off with Reagan in the general election, Carter’s Achilles’ heel would be his penchant for aggressive campaigning, not some perception of weakness. Jimmy Carter's own mother, Lillian, once described him as “a beautiful cat with sharp claws.” Journalist Hunter S. Thompson called Carter ""one of the three meanest men I’ve ever met."" The other two were boxer Muhammad Ali and Sonny Barger, leader of the Hells Angels. Carter, Thompson said, “would cut my head off to carry North Dakota. He’d cut both your legs off to carry a ward in the Bronx. ... He will eat your shoulder right off if he thinks it’s right.” After a series of comments about Reagan that implied the Republican was catering to racism in some voters, Carter was portrayed by the political press as going too far. He did a damage-control interview with Barbara Walters. Her first question pointed out to him that he had, in recent days, “been characterized as mean, vindictive, hysterical and on the point of desperation."" On Oct. 22, a week before the first and only debate between Carter and Reagan, comments from Iranian leaders suggested that a resolution — and a release of the 52 remaining Americans in Tehran — could be imminent. This raised the prospect of a dramatic turnaround for Carter’s fortunes. He had been saved from the Kennedy challenge by the seizure of the hostages. Would his response to the crisis now help him win a second term? There were still tense moments in the final weekend before the election as it appeared the hostages might be released. But it was not to be. The hostages were not released, and Carter went down to a historic defeat. Reagan beat him in 44 out of 50 states and crushed him in the Electoral College 489 to 49. The 1980 election was marked by apathy. Reagan beat Carter amid the lowest turnout in a presidential election since 1948. Only 52.4% of eligible voters went to the polls. But it was a historically significant election because the coalition that Democrats had relied on for decades since FDR’s presidency — combining union members in the big cities, poor rural voters, racial minorities, Catholics and the South — had splintered for good. It was a realigning event. Carter’s total loss of support among white Baptist voters in the South demonstrated how badly his coalition from 1976 had been turned upside down. Carter finished out his term working obsessively to release the hostages. He signed a series of executive orders executing a deal with the Iranian government and spent his last weekend in office waiting for word on whether the deal would go through. He announced its completion at 4:44 a.m. on Monday, Jan. 19, the day before Reagan’s inauguration. Carter aides hoped the deal would be done so quickly he could go to meet the hostages in Germany that evening and be back in Washington on Inauguration Day to transfer power to Reagan. But it was not to be. In one final indignity, the Iranians released the hostages only after Reagan had been sworn in as the nation’s 40th president. Carter, years later, would imply that he believed Reagan had made a deal with Ayatollah Khomeini, the Iranian leader, to wait until the inauguration to free the hostages, in exchange for military equipment that Tehran needed to fight Saddam Hussein’s Iraqi troops. Gary Sick, an Iran expert who served on Carter’s National Security Council staff, published a book in 1991 titled “October Surprise,” which made the case that Reagan had colluded with the Iranians. Carter told author Douglas Brinkley in 1995 that “if you try to dig further into Gary’s ‘October Surprise’ revelations, and are successful, you may not like what you find.” After an initial period of depression and searching, Carter became a major factor in international relations in the late ’80s and ’90s. He was helped by his close friendship with fellow Georgian Ted Turner, who owned the fledgling 24-hour cable news network CNN, launched during Carter’s final year in office. Carter spent decades in a frenetic and often freelancing pursuit of global peacemaking and healing. Rosalynn was always at his side and as much a partner as ever. Though he became even more active in the Middle East peace process, he grew more radical in his support for an independent Palestinian state and his outspoken criticism of Israel. He was a regular presence in Latin America, convened arms control experts at his Carter Center in Atlanta and launched efforts to eradicate disease in Africa. In 1986, he set a goal of eradicating the painful Guinea worm disease from the Earth. Also called dracunculiasis, it afflicted roughly 3.5 million people at that time, most of them in central Africa, and the United Nations estimated that 100 million people were at risk of the disease. In 2015, there were only 22 cases in Africa. On his last Sunday as president, Carter — a defeated politician — taught Sunday school at First Baptist Church in Washington, D.C., and talked about Jesus’s remark that “it is the one who is least among you all who is the greatest.” Carter said, “Is greatness being a president? An emperor?” No, he said. “The foundation of greatness is service to others.” By that definition, the always ambitious Carter achieved greatness in his post-presidency. He was not a central player in the biggest story of the late ’80s and early ’90s: the fall of communist governments in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. But he did enter the public eye as a key figure in some internationally known conflicts during that time. He stood up to Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega in 1989. After observing elections there, Carter compiled evidence that Noriega had stolen the election, and he vigorously denounced the Panamanian ruler during a 45-minute press conference in Panama City. In 1994, Carter was again an influential force. He helped prevent a U.S. invasion of Haiti through last-minute negotiations, headed off a conflict with North Korea and helped secure a four-month ceasefire in the bloody Balkan conflict between Serbs, Croats and Bosnians. But in the latter two cases, Carter alienated himself from the first Democratic president to take office since he had left it, Bill Clinton. Carter’s freelancing on CNN — announcing details of a deal without consulting Clinton — limited the president’s choices and was viewed as deeply disloyal. It was similar to the way he had ruined a healthy relationship with President George H.W. Bush’s administration by publicly and privately seeking to undermine the administration’s coalition building as it prepared to send troops to Kuwait in 1991 to throw Iraqi invaders out. Carter’s lone attempt at urban renewal, labeled the Atlanta Project and launched in 1991, achieved subpar results in helping reduce poverty. But he led a robust and energetic life even into his 90s. In addition to his relentless book writing, he won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002. In August 2015 he underwent surgery for brain cancer. Miraculously, he was declared cancer-free three months later. He continued to teach Sunday school in Plains on a regular basis. Carter was often criticized and belittled by the right. But many of his once unpopular stands looked better over time. He spoke out against the invasion of Iraq when doing so was unpopular. He spoke out against the war on drugs in 2011 before it was really all that fashionable to do so. He saw the importance of housing in fighting poverty. He helped make Habitat for Humanity, a community service organization, a globally known charity and continued to build houses with the group into his 90s. Carter's presidency was beleaguered by external challenges and his own weaknesses. He was hindered by his tendency to judge others by the same incredibly high standards he set for himself. He felt it was beneath him to trade favors with lawmakers or cajole them into supporting his ideas. He preferred to persuade them through pure reason. This obtuseness about how politics actually worked undermined him. But he was an extraordinary individual who came from the dirt of a southwest Georgia farm during the Great Depression and accomplished more in a life than most would ever dare or dream, ending his life as one of the greatest humanitarians of our time.",16.4k,[],2025-01-06 04:02:05,2025-01-06 04:02:05

My name is Kaitlin Reilly, and nearly every week throughout 2024 I’ve rounded up the internet’s latest health and wellness tips. This is our last Sunday edition of the year and it’s been a pleasure helping you improve your life in big and small ways. With New Year’s Eve just days away, you may be considering the resolutions you’re setting for 2025. While the obvious choice for many may be to hit the gym more often (as so many of us will do come Jan. 2), one pro-health goal you may not have considered is getting better sleep. There’s a good reason why you should: Getting quality shut-eye (aka “sleepmaxxing,” as social media has coined it) can improve your overall wellness, from boosting your immune system to enhancing memory and brain function. Plus, doing so may give you more energy to exercise and stop you from reaching for less nutritious foods as a pick-me-up (like, say, a Snickers bar from the vending machine when you hit that afternoon slump). Want some tips to get started? Establishing a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine and limiting screen time before bed can be your gateway to better rest in 2025. See for yourself — The Yodel is the go-to source for daily news, entertainment and feel-good stories. By signing up, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Policy. In the meantime, check the weather in your area and, if you are so inclined, your horoscope. Then read up on these wellness tips. Celebrating New Year’s Eve can be a fun and festive way to start 2025, but it’s important to keep a few safety tips in mind. More than 50% of crashes on New Year’s involve drivers with high blood alcohol content, per American Safety Council, so if you are planning on going out, make sure you designate a sober driver, plan for public transportation in advance or call an Uber or other ride-share service. And speaking of alcohol — there’s also a risk of injury when popping that bubbly beverage, as many people do at midnight. To avoid shooting that cork into someone’s eye, make sure to chill the champagne to 45 degrees Fahrenheit, which will make it less likely to go rogue. Then, hold the bottle with one hand and use the other to twist the cork, nudging it gently out of the bottle and controlling the release of air. After a minute, the cork should come free. Fireworks and sparklers may seem like a fun way to ring in the new year, but experts warn that playing with them can be dangerous, especially when children are in the mix. In 2023, fireworks led to 9,700 emergency room visits and eight deaths, per the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Sparklers, which can get up to 3,000 degrees, can also be risky — 700 injuries were caused by sparklers in 2023 alone. If you do want to see some fireworks on New Year’s Eve, find a viewing of professional ones in your area — and keep children at least 500 feet away from where the fireworks will be set off in order to mitigate accident risk, as well as dampen noise. Pop noise-cancelling headphones on to protect you and/or your little one’s ears from intense sound, which can damage your hearing. A September report found that coffee consumption is linked to lower risk of heart disease, diabetes and stroke — and now there’s another reason to pour yourself a cup of java. A review of 14 prior studies by the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology Consortium revealed that drinking four cups of caffeinated coffee daily could reduce the likelihood of developing head or neck cancer by up to 17%. Tea too may reduce head and neck cancer risk, according to some of the study interpretations. The theory is that coffee and tea contain powerful anticancer and anti-inflammatory compounds that could protect against the harmful effects of carcinogens. Other warm beverages have some health benefits as well. The cocoa in hot chocolate, for example, may improve blood pressure as well as cholesterol and blood glucose levels. The spices in chai, like cinnamon, can also help fight inflammation and control blood sugar. Experts spoke to HuffPost about what veggies you should eat to improve different health factors. Dietitian Lena Bakovic said that those who want to improve their cardiovascular health should eat more leafy greens, which contain heart-healthy compounds like nitrates, which keep blood vessels open. Given that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that heart disease is the leading cause of death in America, it’s a great reason to pile your plate with Swiss chard, spinach, kale and collard greens. If you often struggle with an uncomfortable burning sensation in your chest, known as heartburn, you know how important it is to find relief, especially if it interrupts your sleep. While popping antacids may quickly resolve the issue, doing so long-term can lead your body to produce more acid as a rebound effect — leading to more annoying symptoms over time. Instead, experts told Yahoo Life to try sleeping at a slight elevation, such as with a wedge pillow, which can help keep stomach acid from flowing back into your esophagus. Another tip? Stop eating 90 minutes before lying down; that gives your body more time to digest food and reduces the likelihood of experiencing heartburn. Caviar, which is made from sturgeon eggs, may be way too pricey to make a regular part of your grocery list, even as the high-low food trend spreads and people are putting the pricey delicacy on everything from potato chips to mozzarella sticks. If you do see it at your next party, however, or just feel like splurging on a fancy treat, dietitians give this fishy food the seal of approval, thanks to the fact that it is rich in protein, vitamin B12, vitamin D, selenium and iron. Just be cautious about how you consume it: While it may taste delicious with a dollop of crème fraîche, you could be getting more fat and calories than you’d like. Dr. Michael Roizen, a 78-year-old anesthesiologist, internist and longevity expert, claims he reversed his biological age by 20 years. One tip he gave Insider for how he did it? Eating lots of salmon, avocado and olive oil — all foods that are rich in healthy fats, which support heart health, reduce inflammation and promote cell repair. These are all foods included in the much-celebrated Mediterranean diet, which is plant-focused and high in omega-3s. Want to follow his lead? Try adding a salmon salad to your lunchtime routine. Many in the U.K. take Christmas week walks, but going for a long stroll, especially after a meal, is a great idea no matter the day. Experts told Yahoo Life that these walks can help regulate your blood sugar, improve digestion and prevent post-meal energy dips. Walking in a winter wonderland? Just make sure to stay hydrated, wear layers and shoes with proper tread, and keep a charged cellphone on hand in case you need assistance. An Economist/YouGov poll of 1,500 people found that 46% of Americans didn’t finish a single book last year — and only 5% finished one, continuing a data trend of Americans reading fewer books overall. That’s unfortunate, given that research has shown there are many health benefits to doing so. Reading books lowers your heart rate, reduces stress, improves your cognition over time and may help you sleep better. Want to get into a reading habit? Schedule a manageable amount of time to sneak in some pages — like, say, 20 pages per day right when you wake up in the morning, as Atomic Habits author James Clear does. Not into morning reading? Grab a book on your lunch hour, or swap out a TV show with a few chapters before bed. You may have heard of the “Winter Arc,” which is a TikTok-fueled trend that has people committing to transforming their lives during the colder months by adopting intense fitness, productivity or self-improvement routines. Sam Hopes, a personal trainer, doesn’t think a total rehaul of your life this season is effective long-term, however. Instead, writing for Tom’s Guide, Hopes said to stick to SMART goals — specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-based objectives. So instead of saying, “I’m going to walk more in 2025,” pick a reasonable goal — like walking 7,000 steps each day. You’ll be more likely to track your progress, which can help you stick to it over time. We all need both omega-3- and omega-6-rich foods in our diets, but the imbalance of them may lead to increased inflammation, which is linked to chronic diseases such as heart disease and arthritis. While most Americans tend to get more than enough omega-6-rich foods — which include vegetable oils, common in processed foods — many more are falling behind on omega-3s. A solution? Pile your plate with omega-3 foods like salmon, mackerel, chia seeds and spinach. 🧘 More wellness tips: Try hot yoga to alleviate stress. Do vigorous exercise to boost your brainpower.

Here's how to properly care for and clean your kitchen staples.,,Lifestyle,Yahoo Life,6 min read,"Why some people are making the move to wooden cutting boards, and how to keep yours in good condition.",Priscilla Blossom,2024-12-29T10:00:16.000Z,"Plastic is cheap, easy to clean and comes in an array of fun colors, making it a popular choice for kitchen staples ranging from colanders to salad spinners to spatulas. Lately, however, there have been growing concerns about microplastics flaking off our cutting boards and into our food. Is it time to start swapping them out for wooden chopping boards and utensils? “Wooden kitchen utensils are a natural substance which have been heat-treated to perform specific tasks in the kitchen, from spoons to cutting boards,” Mitzi Baum, CEO of Stop Foodborne Illness, tells Yahoo Life. “Many cooks prefer the use of wood because of its organic nature.” But while kitchen items made from wood may be a more natural choice, there are some best practices to follow to keep them hygienic (and less likely to spread food-borne illnesses, especially if you're handling meat) and in good condition. Here's what to know. “Durability! If taken care of correctly, wooden kitchen supplies can last for a long time,” says Ashley Lonsdale, chef in residence for the meat delivery service ButcherBox. “Wooden utensils have a decent amount of heat resistance, so they're durable and won't melt in extremely hot temperatures.” See for yourself — The Yodel is the go-to source for daily news, entertainment and feel-good stories. By signing up, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Policy. Sarah Bond, a food scientist, nutritionist and recipe developer at Live Eat Learn, agrees. “I found that my little utensils and cutting board last virtually forever, as long as you take care of [them] properly,” she says. Beyond its earth-friendly appeal, wood has naturally antimicrobial properties, helping to keep bacteria from spreading in the kitchen. Food-safe wooden kitchen tools are generally low-risk so long as you care for them properly. But there are considerations when it comes to preparing or cutting meat. Officially, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Meat and Poultry Hotline recommends using a separate board when working with raw meat, poultry or seafood from contaminating other food, such as fruits, vegetables or bread. Jordan Kuiper, an epidemiologist and assistant professor in the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health, takes a more cautious approach. “Wooden boards are considered to be a porous material, so cutting things like meat, poultry and fish on them may make it harder to fully clean and disinfect them afterward, increasing the risk of exposure to harmful bacteria,” Kuiper recently told Yahoo Life. “I don't recommend cutting raw meat or ingredients that require deep cleaning on a wood cutting board,” agrees Lonsdale. Kuiper suggests using a nonporous cutting surface like glass or stone, which the USDA notes is easier to clean than wood. The USDA also notes that bamboo cutting boards are less porous than hardwood options, and therefore more resistant to bacteria. In addition to food safety considerations, there are a few minor practical pitfalls that come from working with wood. Lonsdale says that cleaning can be more labor-intensive, and wood items are prone to stains from ingredients such as turmeric. Bond adds that wooden utensils aren’t quite as effective as rubber spatulas at scraping a bowl clean. Not all wood is the same. A solid wood board, for example, is more durable than a laminated board, for instance, and some materials are less porous than others. Lonsdale, who swears by John Boos butcher blocks with an oil finish, says simplicity is key. “For wood utensils, they should be finished with a food-grade oil,” adds Baum. “No stains, paint or chemical finishes.” “I have both bamboo (the most affordable) boards and maple Boos boards. Those are both more economical, affordable options for wood boards,” says Marcia Smart, a culinary instructor, food writer and creator of Smart in the Kitchen. Our experts also recommend tools made from acacia, maple, cherry and walnut. According to the USDA's Meat and Poultry Hotline, solid wood cutting boards can go in the dishwasher, though laminated cutting boards may crack or split. Many cooks, and all of our experts, prefer to wash them by hand using warm, soapy water, however. The USDA suggests doing a final rinse with clear water before air drying or patting dry with clean paper towels. Smart advises washing cutting boards on both sides (even if you only used the top) and drying them fully standing up on their thinnest side, versus laying them flat, in order to avoid warping or distortion. If you've cut raw meat on your board, Smart recommends washing it afterward with hot versus warm water. Additionally, Baum says you can also avoid cross-contamination by color-coding your cutting boards, using one for raw meats and another for things like produce and bread. “For wood cutting boards and utensils that are in good condition (not chipped or split or scarred by knives), utilizing food-safe cleansers and sanitizers [such as vinegar] are appropriate,” says Baum. While the USDA says that wooden boards can be sanitized with liquid bleach mixed with water, Baum advises against it, as the wood can absorb the chemicals. Other top tips: Don't fully submerge your cutting board in water or let it soak; this can create warping Use a cloth dipped in vinegar to remove odors from strong-smelling foods like garlic and onions Mixing baking soda and water to make a paste can also help remove strong odors Use a salt and lemon scrub to remove or minimize stains from brightly colored foods One of the appeals of wood is that it's generally durable, but it needs proper care to keep it from cracking or forming hard-to-clean grooves. In addition to careful cleaning, experts have a number of helpful suggestions: Replace wood kitchenware when it begins to break or split: “It is almost impossible to sanitize a rough wood surface and that could create an environment for bacteria to live and grow,” says Baum. Use wood oil to regularly moisturize your tools: Smart uses food-grade mineral oil or a wood oil from John Boos. Bond says she has had success simply using a tablespoon of vegetable oil, which she rubs into the wood with a paper towel and allows to sit for several hours before rubbing off any excess. Keep the cutting board oiled to help prevent stains. Lonsdale also recommends avoiding ingredients like beets, coffee and red wine spilling onto the board as they have vibrant pigments. Stay away from open flames. While wooden utensils — like wooden spoons used for stirring stew — should fare fine around high heat, Bond keeps them away from open flames to avoid burning. She also avoids putting anything too hot on her cutting board to avoid warping or burn marks.",26,[],2025-01-06 04:02:05,2025-01-06 04:02:05

For people born in December, they can be a bummer amid the holiday chaos.",Elena Sheppard,2024-12-28T10:00:13.000Z,"Birthdays, wherever they fall on the calendar, tend to come with some baggage. “People get birthday blues for a variety of reasons,” explains clinical psychologist Carla Marie Manly, who hosts the podcast Imperfect Love. “If a birthday is viewed as a sign of ‘getting too old’ or ‘not having accomplished enough’ by a certain age, feelings of depression can set in.” But when a birthday falls in December, something especially fraught occurs, as one popular meme puts it: “All I want for Christmas is for someone to remember my December birthday.” Sure, December birthdays can seem like a joke, but for many the reality of having one really can be a downer — especially in childhood. “My birthday is on Christmas,” says Chris Hite, a professor at Allan Hancock College. “Growing up I was constantly reminded by my siblings how I ruined Christmas the year I was born because they all had to be shipped off to our grandparents while our parents were at the hospital.” See for yourself — The Yodel is the go-to source for daily news, entertainment and feel-good stories. By signing up, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Policy. “As a kid I thought having a December birthday was tough,"" licensed psychotherapist Wendy Leeds, whose birthday is December 23, tells Yahoo Life. ""People would give me one gift and say, ‘This is for your birthday and Christmas.’ Or they would forget my birthday entirely.” “A December 24th birthday is all I’ve known,” adds Valerie Zucker, who runs Zucker Media Group. “It’s a time of year that everyone is celebrating, so sometimes my birthday is secondary.” Ask most people in your life with a December birthday how they feel about it, and you’ll likely hear similar responses. Many just don’t feel terribly celebrated when their birthday is squished between so many other events. “It's natural to want to have one day a year that you can call your own: a day where you are showered with special love and birthday attention,” says Manly. “It can feel hurtful when others seem too busy or distracted to celebrate you.” Hite remembers a particularly special birthday celebration, but it involved moving his birthday to a different month. “My mother, a saint, threw me a birthday party one year in summer,” he says. “It was a genuine surprise to see all my school friends at home before school even started, but beyond that, my birthday was never a cause for celebration beyond my immediate family.” December birthday or not, Manly does explain that “birthday blues” can strike no matter what month you were born in. “In my clinical practice, it’s common for certain patients to struggle with the birthday blues,” she says, noting that people who are very giving often end up feeling neglected on their birthdays if a similar fuss isn’t made over them. “Patients who feel lonely and isolated tend to feel more blue around their birthdays because of the heightened sense of feeling uncared for or unloved,” she adds. “Although their feelings of sadness are surely not wrong or inappropriate, people who get the birthday blues often feel terribly guilty — and even ashamed — for feeling sad or neglected.” That said, she also notes that birthday blues can be exacerbated if you were disappointed by your birthday as a child. “Some people get the birthday blues because they — consciously or unconsciously — connect their birthday with unhappy childhood occasions,” she says. “A child whose birthday was often forgotten or ignored might, in adulthood, slip into feeling sad as their birthday nears.” Of course, the feeling of disliking a December birthday is not universal. “I feel truly blessed having this December birthday and celebrating it with family and close friends every year,” says physician Dr. Nesochi Okeke-Igbokwe, whose birthday is on Dec. 24. “Having a birthday during this time of year is an exceptional honor that I truly embrace.” And many, who didn’t love their December birthdays as kids, have grown into feeling gratitude for a birthday during the holiday season. “As a grown-up, I find there are some real benefits to having a December birthday,” says Leeds, noting decorations everywhere, a generally festive feeling in the air and an abundance of music and food on her benefits list. “More importantly,” she adds, “this is the time of year when families come from all parts of the world to be together for the holidays, which means we get to spend our special day with people we might not otherwise see.” As Manly reminds us, birthdays really are all about feeling special, and anyone in your life with a December birthday perhaps needs a little extra attention after a lifetime of birthday-holiday combinations. “Unfortunately, those with December birthdays often feel neglected and lost in the holiday shuffle,” she says. “In our busy world, we want to feel seen and loved.”",86,[],2025-01-06 04:02:05,2025-01-06 04:02:05

Speaking to reporters at the White House, Biden said the transition to Trump's government seemed to be going smoothly, though he said he thought there was a problem with Trump's team internally related to the handover. Asked ahead of the anniversary of the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol whether he still thought Trump was a threat to democracy, Biden said he thought what Trump did was a ""genuine threat to democracy."" Trump falsely claimed he had won the 2020 election and urged his supporters to go to the Capitol that day. ""It should not be rewritten,"" Biden said about Jan. 6. ""I don't think it should be forgotten."" Biden said white supremacy was one of many threats to the United States. ""We are the most extensive multicultural nation in the world. It's the reason why we're so strong. It's the reason why we're who we are,"" Biden said. Trump told NBC last month he plans to take executive action on his first day in office to try to end birthright citizenship, which confers citizenship on anyone born in the U.S. regardless of their parents' immigration status. ""The idea we're going to change a constitutional birthright - if you're born in the country ... you're not a citizen? What's going on?"" Biden said. Biden, a Democrat, criticized Trump, a Republican, for encouraging lawmakers not to vote for a bipartisan immigration bill Biden supported to strengthen border enforcement. ""It's ridiculous.

Trump’s team worked with Speaker Mike Johnson’s leadership team to finalize which members would be invited, the sources said. Between Jan. 10 and Jan. 12, members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, lawmakers from states affected by the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, chairs of key committees and other groups of Republicans will visit Trump at his Florida residence, just days ahead of his inauguration to a second term. The Mar-a-Lago trips come after a tense speaker vote on Friday in which Trump had to personally convince at least two holdouts to support Johnson’s re-election. It also comes as Republicans prepare to take up one massive reconciliation package later this spring that will likely include an extension of Trump’s 2017 tax law. Trump wants to make sure that Republican lawmakers across the ideological spectrum are unified and on the same page with his ambitious legislative agenda, two of the sources added. A spokesperson for the Trump transition team did not immediately respond to requests for comment about next weekend’s visits. Divisions between different factions of the party were on display after Friday’s speaker vote when members of the Freedom Caucus released a letter saying that they voted for Johnson “because of our steadfast support of President Trump.” They added, “We did this despite our sincere reservations regarding the Speaker’s track record over the past 15 months.” Along with Trump’s victory in November, Republican lawmakers retained control of the House and flipped control of the Senate, meaning the GOP is likely to have an easier time advancing its agenda once Trump is inaugurated. But in the House, Republicans have a fragile majority and can barely afford to lose a single vote when advancing Trump’s preferred legislation. It’ll force GOP House members to be almost unanimously united on their agenda. Already in the first vote of the year, three GOP lawmakers — Reps. Keith Self of Texas, Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Ralph Norman of South Carolina — initially voted for someone other than Johnson for speaker. Self and Norman changed their decisions minutes after casting their first votes, ensuring a victory for Johnson.

Two Republicans, Reps. Keith Self (Texas) and Ralph Norman (S.C.), initially voted against Johnson before flipping their ballots after phone calls with Trump and commitments that the conference would work more collaboratively. ""I would think that the speaker ought to put into practice as he presides over the full Congress the same thing he did in order to get elected on the first ballot,"" Clyburn told MSNBC's Jen Psaki on Sunday on ""Inside with Jen Psaki.""

Johnson has an ambitious agenda: The speaker is aiming to push a massive reconciliation package through Congress, one that combines Trump priorities including border security, energy-permitting, tax reform and action on the debt ceiling, by the end of April. Clyburn, a key ally of President Joe Biden whose endorsement in 2020 helped jump-start Biden's primary campaign, also told Psaki he expects Monday's election certification to take on a very different tone from four years ago.

Forecasts called for heavy snow and high winds from the Central Plains to the mid-Atlantic states, the National Weather Service said. Severe weather advisories were issued across the eastern half of the country, including blizzard warnings in parts of Kansas. In Washington, mixed snow and sleet accumulations were expected to be between three and seven inches (7 to 18 cm), promising a difficult commute and possible closings of schools, government and businesses. Bad winter weather can wreak havoc in the Washington metropolitan area, which has seen mild winters in recent decades and has at times been unprepared for accumulations of snow or ice. The city ordered public schools closed on Monday and school cancellations were also announced in several suburban Virginia counties. School systems in neighboring Maryland were likely to follow suit. Members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives returned to Washington on Friday after the winter break and Republicans gathered on Saturday with Johnson to discuss legislative priorities. Republicans won control of both the chambers in November's election. Other leaders stressed they were not contemplating a weather delay. ""No change to the schedule,"" said Lauren Fine, communications director for Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise. The certification process, usually a formality, was upended four years ago when supporters of Trump violently stormed the U.S. Capitol in a bid to halt the transfer of power to Democrat Joe Biden, who won the 2020 election. Trump has continued to falsely claim his 2020 defeat was the result of widespread fraud. Biden and the Democrats say they will honor the 2024 election results and proceed with certification.

Mike Johnson tells House Republicans Trump wants them to pass a single reconciliation bill,,Politics,NBC News,3 min read,"At a closed-door House Republican retreat Saturday morning, newly re-elected House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said President-elect Donald Trump was in favor of passing a single reconciliation bill that would address his priorities, including border security, energy and an extension of his signature 2017 tax law, two sources with direct knowledge told NBC News.",Julie Tsirkin,2025-01-05T23:30:13.000Z,"At a closed-door House Republican retreat Saturday morning, newly re-elected House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said President-elect Donald Trump was in favor of passing a single reconciliation bill that would address his priorities, including border security, energy and an extension of his signature 2017 tax law, two sources with direct knowledge told NBC News. Since the November election, when Republicans took back control of the White House and the Senate and retained control of the House, GOP lawmakers have publicly debated whether to attempt to pass one or two reconciliation bills to advance their agenda. Reconciliation allows Congress to pass party-line policies related to taxes and spending with simple majority votes, suspending the Senate’s usual 60-vote threshold needed to pass legislation. In an interview Sunday on Fox News, Johnson reiterated that Trump wants to pass ""one big, beautiful bill"" using reconciliation. ""I think at the end of the day, President Trump is going to prefer, as he likes to say, one big, beautiful bill,"" Johnson said. He added: ""And there’s a lot of merit to that, because we can put it all together one big up-or-down vote, which can save the country, quite literally, because there are so many elements to it, and it’ll give us a little bit more time to negotiate that and get it right. That doesn’t mean that we won’t come right out of the gates, you know, full-fledged, right out of the beginning of the Congress."" Johnson later added that the bill would include ""a lot of pieces."" ""We’ve made a lot of campaign promises President Trump did as well, and reconciliation is the way to get it done,"" he said, adding that the border and the economy would be two priorities to address. With a razor-thin House Republican majority and a four-seat GOP Senate majority, Republican lawmakers would still have little wiggle room to lose GOP votes, even when passing laws using reconciliation. Johnson’s revelation that Trump is in favor of a single reconciliation bill is important because some in the president-elect’s orbit, including those who will be involved in negotiating any package like his immigration policy adviser Stephen Miller, have been pushing Republicans for two separate reconciliation bills: one tackling immigration and the other focusing on Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, which will expire later this year. Trump’s endorsement of just one bill will be welcome news to many in leadership but could be a blow to some hard-liners who want the border addressed immediately. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., endorsed a two-bill strategy in December, and Republicans in the chamber have already begun setting up the process for a border-only reconciliation bill. “In my view, it makes sense to move quickly on things we know we can do quickly — border, defense, energy,” Thune told reporters last month. “And then come back with another package that would address some of the savings that can be achieved through reductions in cost in various agencies and bureaucracies and government programs and then also deal with the expiring Trump tax cuts in a package later this year.” Most Republicans in Congress have raised issues with attempting two budget bills in a single year through the wonky process that allows them to bypass the 60-vote threshold. It would be a heavy lift unifying the party around two massive bills, they say, rather than just one, and could unnecessarily expend political capital. Lawmakers tasked with crafting tax policy, who are already plotting the tax package, are also worried that splitting the bills into two would raise the price tag of extending Trump’s tax cuts and add to the deficit — a red line for many in the GOP. Spokespeople for Trump’s transition team and Thune did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Sunday that the New Year’s Day attack in New Orleans shows Kash Patel “should not be confirmed” as President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to lead the FBI.",Alexandra Marquez,2025-01-05T18:03:26.000Z,"Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Sunday that the New Year’s Day attack in New Orleans shows Kash Patel “should not be confirmed” as President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to lead the FBI. Schiff told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” that the terrorist attack “underscores” why it’s important to have an FBI director “that has experience, has judgment, that has character, that will prioritize defending the country against the violence we saw in New Orleans or the violence we saw on Jan. 6.” Schiff added that the Senate should not confirm “someone whose top priority is political vendettas, who believes in Deep State conspiracy thinking, not someone who is as unqualified as Kash Patel.” A spokesperson for the Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Schiff’s remarks. Patel, a longtime Trump loyalist, has come under fire previously for promoting the falsehood that the 2020 presidential election was “stolen” from Trump. He has also previously spread baseless conspiracy theories that civil servants in the “deep state” are working to overthrow Trump. After Trump said in December he would nominate Patel to lead the FBI, comments Patel made in 2023 to another Trump ally resurfaced. In a podcast taping with Steve Bannon, Patel vowed that Trump would “come after” journalists, lawyers and judges he believes haven’t treated Trump fairly. “We will follow the facts and the law and go to courts of law and correct these justices and lawyers who have been prosecuting these cases based on politics,” Patel said. “We will go out and find the conspirators, not just in government but in the media — yes, we’re going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections,” he added. In an interview with “Meet the Press” on Friday, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said he believed Patel would prioritize the mission of the FBI and rebuilding trust in the institution if he’s confirmed. “The FBI is an agency that I think is in need of reform and needs a good makeover, so to speak. ... I think that confidence and trust [in the FBI] is largely eroded, and there’s an opportunity to fix that,” Thune told moderator Kristen Welker. “I sat down and met with him. I think he understands that’s the mission, and if he’s successful through the nomination process, I hope that he will take very seriously that responsibility and focus on what he can do to make the FBI operate in a way that is protecting the American people and also being accountable,” Thune added. Asked whether he intends to back Patel when the full Senate votes on his confirmation, Thune declined to share his position. “I haven’t been advertising or disclosing my positions on individual nominees at this point just yet, but I — my job is to make sure they get a fair process,” he said.

""We'll disagree on the margins and the process and all that sort of thing, but when it comes to the things we need to get done for the American people, that we think move the country in the right direction, those are all things I think we agree on,"" Thune (R-S.D.) told CBS' Margaret Brennan in an interview to air on ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday morning. With the arrival of President-elect Donald Trump, Republicans will soon have unified control over the three branches of government. But the margins are narrow, with the GOP boasting a 53-47 majority in the Senate and a 219-215 majority in the House, where defections to the Trump administration by Reps. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) and Mike Waltz (R-Fla.) could make things especially tight in the coming months. Border security, immigration enforcement and tax reform are among Trump's key priorities as he readies for a return to the White House. The budget reconciliation process, which President Joe Biden used early in his term to pass the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan — and then again later for the Inflation Reduction Act — is a major reason why. With reconciliation, the minority party in the Senate is unable to launch a filibuster. And Thune isn't worried about ruffling Democratic feathers in the process. ""The Democrats, again, created the template for doing this with how they did the IRA and the American Rescue Plan for doing some things at 51, and we think that a generational investment in the border is necessary, given where we are after the last four years of a what I think is a very failed Biden Harris border policy,"" Thune said. Thune, who said he speaks to Trump ""fairly regularly,"" also expressed confidence that Republican committee chairs would navigate what could be a fraught confirmation period for some of the President-elect's Cabinet nominees, such as Pete Hegseth, Kash Patel and Tulsi Gabbard. ""I do think that in most cases, at least, most of our Republican senators are inclined to give the President the people that he wants in these positions, given, you know, the process that they go through and whether or not they can manage the committee process and ensure that they get to the floor for vote,"" Thune said.",103,[],2025-01-06 04:04:58,2025-01-07 00:21:01
https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-propaganda-victory-rewriting-jan-130040865.html,Trump’s Propaganda Victory: The Rewriting Of Jan. 6,,Politics,HuffPost,7 min read,You can believe your own eyes or Donald Trump's words — and many Americans are choosing to believe him.,S.V. Date,2025-01-05T13:00:40.000Z,"WASHINGTON — It took decades for defenders of the Confederacy to rewrite the history of the Civil War to recast Southern rebels’ treasonous attack against the United States as an act of honor and courage. It took Donald Trump a mere fraction of that time to accomplish the same feat for his Jan. 6, 2021, coup attempt. In a mere four years, that day’s effort to end or, at the very least, suspend American democracy with a deadly assault on the Capitol, incited by Trump himself, has for a large swath of the country instead become a peaceful protest whose participants have been persecuted by Trump’s political opponents. “What they have in common is that in both cases a story is propagated that a portion of the population wants to hear because it absolves them, or those in their in-group, of a transgression of not just the law, but of commonly held moral principles,” said Gabriel Reich, a Virginia Commonwealth University professor who has studied how the history of the Civil War and Reconstruction is taught in schools. “Liberal democracies really struggle with bad-faith actors who manipulate existing rules and norms to their own benefit,” he added. Tom Joscelyn, a counterterrorism expert who served on the staff of the House Jan. 6 committee and was a co-author of its report, said he still finds it hard to believe that people could watch what happened that day unfold on television and then still accept Trump’s version of it. Unlike children growing up in the South in the 1940s and 1950s, for whom the Civil War was generations in the past, Trump’s followers and allies are rejecting readily available evidence of contemporary violence. “All you need is the images and the videos from that day, his own words, and what you saw with your own eyes, and it was clear that he had crossed some bright lines,” he said. “All of that should have been disqualifying, and it wasn’t.” Trump’s transition team did not respond to HuffPost queries. Even since his win in November, Trump has continued to lie about the 2020 election having been stolen from him and has described those who have been prosecuted for their actions on Jan. 6 as political prisoners. “These people have been treated really, really badly,” he told Time magazine last month. “They’ve suffered greatly, and in many cases they should not have suffered.” Mac Stipanovich, a longtime Republican political consultant in Florida, said he remembers as a child reading a plaque honoring dead Confederate soldiers in his town square. “That’s the way we grew up. That’s what we knew,” he said. That Trump was able to revise his own history so quickly is a noteworthy achievement, he added. “It is a tribute to Trump and his posse’s ability to convince half the country,” Stipanovich said. “And it is a telling indictment of the intelligence of that half of the country.” When America elected the leader of a party dedicated to abolishing slavery as president, 11 Southern states decided to secede and started a war against those that remained. That these rebel states would lose was likely inevitable, given the Union’s industrial might and population advantage, and 700,000 deaths later, they did. Yet within a few short years, an effort to reinvent that loss and the motivations behind it began. Confederate sympathizers and segregationists in academia, the media and politics cast men like Robert E. Lee — officers in the U.S. Army who had taken up arms against the United States — as tragic American heroes. And the reason behind the war, the preservation of human slavery, was replaced with a principled defense of “states’ rights” — even though slavery was plainly cited in the states’ own articles of secession. “They made sure that teachers, including university-level historians, taught that story as historical truth, while simultaneously suppressing other points of view from the media,” VCU’s Reich said. It took decades of repetition, replete with the construction of statues and memorials to the leaders of the failed insurrection, but this “Lost Cause” myth eventually became an accepted narrative, primarily in the South but to a lesser extent all over the country. So much so that some U.S. military bases in the first half of the 20th century were named for Confederate officers. Trump’s propaganda campaign to redefine Jan. 6, in contrast, has taken place at lightning speed. On Jan. 6 itself and in the days immediately afterward, the early consensus was that Trump had incited the attack on the Capitol and that he was wrong to do so. Republican congressional leaders blamed him in floor speeches. Trump himself on Jan. 7 read prepared remarks warning members of his mob: “To those who broke the law, you will pay.” Trump’s former United Nations ambassador, Nikki Haley, expressed the conventional wisdom at the time that Trump was finished. “I think he’s lost any sort of political viability he was going to have,” she told Politico on Jan. 12. Four years later, Trump is about to return to the same White House he left in disgrace. His new administration will be stocked with those willing to repeat and spread his continuing lies about the 2020 election. And he has promised not only to pardon those prosecuted for taking part in the Jan. 6 attack but to prosecute those who tried to hold him and his followers to account. That Trump was able to return to power, despite everything, was perhaps foreseeable because he never lost the loyalty of the Republican primary voting base. Indeed, the day after his coup attempt had failed, the overwhelming majority of the 163 members of the Republican National Committee gave him a sustained ovation when he called into their winter meeting in Amelia Island, Florida. Three weeks later, then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, at the time the country’s highest-ranking elected Republican, visited Trump at his South Florida country club, effectively signaling that Trump remained the party’s leader. Two weeks after that, Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, while lambasting Trump for his behavior leading up to and on Jan. 6, nonetheless voted not to convict Trump for inciting the insurrection following his House impeachment for that offense. A conviction would have been followed by a vote to ban him from federal office for life. By April, the RNC was again holding fundraising events at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club, putting donors’ money into his personal bank account. Officials acknowledged privately that Trump remained their biggest fundraising draw and that they had to go along with the fiction that the 2020 election had been stolen because their voters believed it to be true — even though the only reason for that belief was Trump’s lies. And by the end of 2021, following the release of conspiracy theorist Tucker Carlson’s “documentary” claiming that the Jan. 6 insurrection was actually a “false flag” operation by the FBI, Trump began calling those under prosecution for taking part in his coup attempt — even the hundreds convicted for having assaulted police officers — “hostages” and “political prisoners.” Republican candidates for offices large and small in increasing numbers made pilgrimages to Palm Beach to win his endorsement. Journalists similarly made the trek — not to ask about his unprecedented attempt to thwart the peaceful transfer of power, but about his candidacy to regain the presidency in 2024. The new “Lost Cause” myth for Jan. 6 was complete. “It’s disheartening,” Joscelyn said. Stipanovich, who broke from the Republican Party when it embraced Trump in 2016, said that a more apt — and troubling — comparison to Trump’s rewriting of Jan. 6 may be the way Adolf Hitler and the Nazis remade their 1923 Beer Hall Putsch into a valiant act of patriotism, rather than an attempted coup that sent Hitler and others to prison. “When it failed, the heroes of the failure became the hope of the future,” he said. Whatever the appropriate historical analogy, the fact that Trump was able to assault democracy as he did and still come back to power is worrisome, said Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist. Sabato also grew up in that state, where the Civil War was taught as the “War of Northern Aggression.” “The Lost Cause was a ‘big lie,’ but I’m not so sure Trump’s ‘big lie’ will ever be a lost cause,” he warned. “This is not cynicism. It’s the reality we face.” GOP Cheers Hakeem Jeffries For Saying Trump Won — Until He Notes Which Party Is Home To Election Deniers Trump Scolds His Own Nominee As He Introduces Her Democracy Advocates Say Trump’s Return Means They Must Work Even Harder",429,[],2025-01-06 04:04:58,2025-01-07 00:21:01

Joe Biden is set to lead the tributes at a funeral service on Thursday at the Washington National Cathedral. He let slip last year that Carter had asked him to give a eulogy (“Excuse me, I shouldn’t say that,” the president admitted). Biden may be forced to confront uncomfortable parallels with his own political fate. Hurt by inflation and failure to secure the release of hostages in the Middle East, Carter was rebuked by the public and served only one term. However, he was often dubbed the “nation’s greatest former president” for his humanitarian work. But cameras are likely to be trained on Trump, who will be just 11 days away from his inauguration as president. Although the 78-year-old is notorious for trampling on norms, and for trashing his predecessors, he paid warm tribute to Carter and accepted the invitation to attend. Sarah Purcell, a historian at Grinnell College in Grinnell, Iowa, said: “It shows maybe there is at least some desire in Trump to hew to the example of what a president or former president should act like. Maybe there is some line beyond which he will not go: he’s not going to refuse to attend Jimmy Carter’s funeral; he’s not going to stand up and start yelling at Biden during the funeral.” Still, Trump’s demeanour towards Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama will be closely scrutinised. At George HW Bush’s funeral in 2018 he shook hands with Obama but did not interact with Hillary Clinton, whom he defeated in the 2016 election, or her husband Bill. Purcell added: “I’m sure it will be slightly awkward but it’s maybe in a way more remarkable that he’s there at all.” The cathedral service will include Democrats and Republicans and feature bipartisan eulogies from Carter’s predecessor, Gerald Ford, who died in 2006, read by his son Steven, and from Carter’s vice-president Walter Mondale, who died in 2021, read by his son Ted. The occasion promises brief respite from the rancour that prevails in today’s Washington, especially after a bitterly fought election campaign. Purcell, author of Spectacle of Grief, said: “You’ll see both politicians and some everyday people showing signs of unity. It’s usually not a time when people throw eggs. “Our political culture is extremely disrespectful now and so it’s at least a moment where respectful treatment of potential political enemies is likely to win the day. I don’t know if it’s actual unity but it might show the capacity to unify around some kind of ritual of respect, if not around any substance.” The official six-day state funeral was due to begin on Saturday as Carter’s remains travel by motorcade through his home town of Plains, Georgia, stopping at the farm where he grew up. The National Park Service will ring the historic farm bell 39 times because Carter was the 39th president. Carter’s body will then be carried to Atlanta, where he will lie in repose at the Carter Presidential Center until Tuesday morning. He will be flown to Washington, where he will lie in state in the rotunda of the US Capitol, a tradition dating back to Abraham Lincoln. After the cathedral service on Thursday, Carter will be flown back to Georgia and the family will hold a private funeral and interment. He will be buried in a plot next to his wife, Rosalynn Carter, on the grounds of their longtime home in Plains. Admirers of Carter hope that the tributes will encourage appreciation not only of the way he reinvented the post-presidency, winning the Nobel peace prize, but of his accomplishments in office. They also welcome the happenstance that it falls to Biden to deliver the defining eulogy. Jim Pattiz, who along with his brother Will is a film-maker, environmentalist and co-director of the 2021 documentary Carterland, said: “Successive Democratic administrations and powerbrokers turned their backs on Jimmy Carter and kept him at arm’s length and even had some disdain for him – including as recently as Obama. “Joe Biden was not one of those people. Joe Biden never turned his back on Jimmy Carter and was the original supporter of him. He was the first federally elected official to endorse him in 1976 and they’ve been friends ever since. I’m glad that Biden is in charge and able to give Carter the honour that he deserves.”",245,[],2025-01-06 04:04:58,2025-01-07 00:21:01

And it was.",NICHOLAS RICCARDI,2025-01-05T12:38:54.000Z,"This Jan. 6 won't be the same. Four years ago, then-President Donald Trump urged supporters to head to the Capitol to protest Congress' certification of Democrat Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 election. “Will be wild!” Trump promised on Twitter a few weeks before Jan. 6, 2021. And it was. Trump gave a vitriolic speech to thousands of people gathered at the Ellipse behind the White House, after which many marched to the Capitol and stormed the building in an attempt to stop the previously routine final step in formalizing the winner of the presidential election. Even after the rioters dispersed, eight Republicans in the Senate and 139 in the House voted against ratifying Biden's win in certain swing states, despite no evidence of problems or wrongdoing that could have affected the outcome. This year, the only turbulence preceding the quadrennial ratification of the presidential election resulted from House Republicans fighting among themselves over who should be speaker. “There will be no violence. There will be no attempt to mount an insurrection against the Constitution,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md. “It will be a lot more like what we’ve seen for the rest of American history.” The last time, Trump urged his vice president, Mike Pence, who was presiding over the certification, to intervene to keep him in the White House. This time, Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee against Trump, has acknowledged her loss and isn't expected to try to change long-established procedures for certifying the election. No other prominent Democrat has urged the party to contest Trump's win, either. Congress also has since updated the law that governs the proceeding, clarifying the process in the states and specifying the vice president's role as merely ministerial. After the 2020 election, many Republicans contended there were signs of massive voter fraud that made it impossible to confirm Biden's victory, even though there has never been any indication of widespread fraud. After Trump won this November, many of those same Republicans had no such objections, saying they trusted the accuracy of the vote count. It was a change in sentiment shared by Republicans across the country. “As citizens, we should all be happy when it goes smoothly,” said Edward Foley, a law professor at Ohio State University. “It's always better not to have major contestation over elections, especially when there isn't a reasonable position for it.” Still, the calm may be illusory. Trump and Republicans had signaled that if had Harris won, they were prepared to contest her victory. Vice President-elect JD Vance, as an Ohio senator, argued that Pence should have acted to overturn Biden's election. Vance himself is set to be in the position to preside over the next significant Jan. 6 — in 2029, when Congress will be scheduled to accept the electoral votes for the winner of the 2028 presidential election. “The most dangerous January 6 event is not January 6, 2025. It’s January 6, 2029, and beyond,” said David Weinberg of Protect Democracy, which defends against what it terms authoritarian threats to the country. “It creates an enormous problem when only one side of the aisle stands down when it loses an election.” The Constitution lays out some basic steps required to choose the next president, and congressional legislation has filled in the procedural blanks. After states choose their winning candidates on Election Day, electors who are pledged to vote for those candidates meet as the Electoral College and formally cast their votes for president. Congress then tallies the votes on Jan. 6 in a joint session presided over by the vice president to formally determine who's won a majority of the Electoral College. In 2021, Trump pushed for Pence not to read out the tallies from swing states that Biden won, thereby forcing Congress to vote to accept a list of states where Trump won the majority of the Electoral College. That ploy was something that Pence and numerous legal scholars said was an unconstitutional act. A year later, Biden signed the bipartisan bill that updated the 1887 law governing the joint session to make clear the vice president needs to read all of the state tallies. The Electoral Count Reform Act also makes it harder to object to the congressional vote. Still, many House Republicans remain opposed to that law. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., was a prime supporter of Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 loss and had not ruled out trying to change the election outcome if Trump lost in November. Republicans spent the final weeks of the election contending Democrats would do the same if Trump won, citing a push by some to disqualify the former president from the ballot under the Constitution's once-obscure “insurrection clause."" That effort ultimately was rebuffed by the U.S. Supreme Court. Republicans say the size of Trump's election victory is why there is no potential unrest. He won the presidency by about 230,000 votes in the swing states and the popular vote by 1.5 percentage points after losing by about 44,000 votes in the swing states and 4.5 percentage points nationwide in 2020. “This time, I think the win was so decisive that it just — for good or ill depending on which side you’re on — it’s stifled most of that,"" said Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs, a Republican who led the objections on Jan. 6, 2021, over groundless allegations of voter fraud. Foley, author of the book “Ballot Battles” about election challenges in U.S. history, advised Congress on changes to the law governing the joint session and its certification of the presidential election. He said he hoped the 2024 election marks the end of groundless challenges to congressional certification, even though the candidate who spearheaded the last challenge won. That's because Trump has said he won't run again and is constitutionally barred from seeking a third term. Foley noted that, in 2022, a number of Republicans tried to mimic Trump's distrust of election results and widely lost in swing states. Election denial, he said, may not be viable if not attached to Trump. “As Trump will never be a candidate again,” Foley said, “I hope this is beyond us.” ___ AP Congressional Correspondent Lisa Mascaro in Washington contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

And let's call President-elect Donald Trump's lying just what it is.,Jackie Calmes,2025-01-05T11:05:22.000Z,"Four years ago on Jan. 6, not even most Republicans would have imagined this 2025 anniversary: The West Front of the Capitol — where rioters battled outnumbered police to breach the building, marauding and hunting for lawmakers — is currently getting gussied up for this month’s inauguration of the 2021 mob’s inciter: Donald Trump. “All I can say is count me out, enough is enough,” South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham famously harrumphed in the Senate back then. He was one of many Republicans who condemned Trump for the attack after it was put down and members of Congress — along with the day’s chief target, Trump’s Vice President Mike Pence — could safely return to certify the 2020 election of Joe Biden. Within a month, those same Republicans, cowed by Trump’s fanatically loyal voters, ate their words and returned to his fold — and, in shape-shifter Graham’s case, to his golf courses. Ever since, the Republican Party has either downplayed the violence of Jan. 6 or, like Trump, denied that it was anything more than “great patriots” exercising their 1st Amendment rights or making “a normal tourist visit” to the Capitol, though we all watched an insurrection in real time and in countless video replays. They’ve condemned Americans to be bit players in a Marx Brothers comedy: “Who you gonna believe, me or your own eyes?” But this charade isn’t funny. Let's mark this anniversary by recalling some facts about what happened that day and afterward, in the run-up to President Biden’s inauguration. And by calling the gaslighting, the lying, just what it is. Lies like this: On Tuesday, Republican Rep. Eric Burlison of Missouri told the right-wing Newsmax that those criminally charged after Jan. 6 — nearly 1,600 people, including almost 1,000 who’ve pleaded guilty, according to a Justice Department update — were entrapped by the FBI “to do things that they didn’t even know might be illegal.” Who doesn’t know that assaulting police with iron pipes, tasers, pepper spray, bats and flagpoles, injuring more than 140 of them, contributing to the deaths of several, and doing millions of dollars of damage to federal property is illegal? And how does a political party that professes to support law enforcement come to make these absurdist arguments? Blind fealty to, or fear of, the incoming president is how. But the voters have spoken, and a narrow plurality chose Trump, the Jan. 6 instigator, to become president in two weeks. And his “day one” promises include pardoning those he calls “the J-6 hostages.” “Those people have suffered long and hard,” the usually unempathetic president-elect said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” last month. Trump first excused those who’d assaulted police — “They had no choice” — and then suggested the police actually invited the rioters into the Capitol: “You had the police saying, ‘Come on in. Come on in.’ ” (Now you know where the likes of Burlison get their nonsense.) According to Trump, it’s the Democrats and Republicans who were on the House Jan. 6 investigatory committee — “political thugs” and “creeps” — who should be in jail. This from the former and future commander in chief who, the committee found, sat in the White House for three hours that day — “187 minutes of dereliction” — watching the mayhem on TV and drinking Diet Coke as aides, family, friends and Fox News hosts implored him to do something, say something, to stop it. As the Jan. 6 committee’s final report concluded: “There’s no question that President Trump had the power to end the insurrection. He was not only the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. military, but also of the rioters.” Biden delivered his answer to Trump’s perverse judgment this week: He awarded the nation’s second-highest civilian honor to Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi and former Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the Democratic chair and Republican vice chair of the Jan. 6 committee — Cheney for “putting the American people over party” and Thompson for “dedication to safeguarding our Constitution.” But Trump’s pliant Justice Department could get the last word, alas. In the meantime, Biden is providing the “smooth transition” that sore-loser Trump denied him after the 2020 election. “Welcome back,” the president told Trump a week after the 2024 election at the traditional White House meeting of incoming and outgoing presidents, another norm Trump scorned in 2020 as he contested his loss in a free and fair election. Back then, the post-Jan. 6 preparations for Biden’s inauguration had a wartime feel amid fears of a repeat attempt to prevent his taking office. Among the security measures were 7-foot fencing topped with razor wire around the Capitol, concrete barriers, boarded-up windows, barricaded roads and closed subway stations, military vehicles and 25,000 National Guard troops on the streets, with thousands more police from around the nation deputized to help. On Inauguration Day 2021, Trump was not on the platform — one of the few presidents in U.S. history to willfully refuse to attend his successor’s swearing-in — but Pence was. On this Jan. 20, Trump will be there, of course, with Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris looking on as he’s sworn in. Pence will be absent, repudiated in favor of a vice presidential pick, JD Vance, more likely than Pence proved to be to put Trump above the Constitution. Four years ago, given the security threat and still-spreading pandemic, Biden spoke to an empty expanse; a “field of flags” stood in for crowds on the National Mall. “We learned again that democracy is precious, democracy is fragile,” the new president said. But, he added, “At this hour, my friends, it has prevailed.” Democracy will prevail again on this Jan. 20. To the benefit of, but no thanks to, Donald Trump. @jackiekcalmes If it’s in the news right now, the L.A. Times’ Opinion section covers it. Sign up for our weekly opinion newsletter.

Lee,2025-01-05T02:39:22.000Z,"President Joe Biden plans to deliver two major speeches before leaving office as part of an effort to outline what he sees as key parts of his legacy from more than 50 years in public service, according to two people familiar with the plans. The first speech is set to focus on foreign policy and is expected to be delivered sometime after Biden returns on Jan. 12 from a trip to Italy, these people said. They said Biden then plans to close out his final days in the White House with a farewell address to the country. Neither speech has been fully drafted, the sources familiar with the president’s plans said, but the contours and themes of both have been developed. In his farewell address, Biden is expected to offer a message to Americans for the future and reflect on his decades in public office, including his four years in the White House, according to the people familiar with the president’s plans. The traditional address is expected to channel a similar spirit to the parting sentiments offered by some of Biden’s recent predecessors, including former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, who delivered their farewell speeches from the White House, and former President Barack Obama, who opted to speak to the nation from his hometown of Chicago in front of a large audience of supporters. After losing the 2020 election, President-elect Donald Trump posted a pre-recorded video message online the day before Biden was sworn in to office. Biden’s foreign policy speech is set to focus on his belief that America is stronger when it invests in its alliances across the world, according to the people familiar with the president’s speeches. Biden is expected to highlight his efforts to broaden and strengthen the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and U.S. relations in the Indo-Pacific, as well as his administration’s military and financial support for Ukraine since Russia’s invasion in 2022. It’s unclear how much the speech might touch on Biden’s decision to order the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, which has been widely criticized and resulted in the deaths of 13 American service members. Biden is likely to reference his administration’s efforts to combat terrorist groups, including ISIS, but the speech is not expected to dwell on domestic terrorism threats following the New Year’s Day attack in New Orleans, the people familiar with the president’s plans said. The administration is looking at additional steps it could take before Biden leaves office to try to help prevent attacks driven by homegrown radicalization, a person familiar with the discussions said. The president is planning for a busy final two weeks in office. He’s scheduled to travel on Monday to New Orleans to meet with family members of victims of the attack there, as well as local officials. He will then visit California to highlight his record on the environment, including new designations of national monuments. On Thursday, Biden is scheduled to travel to Rome and Vatican City for a three-day visit, likely his final international travel in office. And before leaving the White House on Jan. 20, the president is expected to issue additional pardons, specifically focused on sentencing disparities, a person familiar with the plans said. This person said Biden has not decided whether to pre-emptively pardon people who could be targeted by the new Trump administration for retribution, though Biden would not pardon anyone who does not want to receive clemency.

The latest filing in the Supreme Court case comes after Trump’s lawyer D. John Sauer asked the court to pause the law beyond the deadline to give the president-elect “the opportunity to pursue a political resolution to the questions at issue in the case.” The DOJ argued that Trump’s filing took “no position” on the First Amendment question, which is the basis of the lawsuit that the Supreme Court agreed to hear on a fast-tracked basis. TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance, sued to try to stop implementation of the law, arguing that it violates its free speech rights under the First Amendment. The DOJ said that granting Trump’s request would equate to a temporary injunction and could only be implemented if ByteDance established a likelihood that it would win the case, but that the company had not done so. The Justice Department also tackled ByteDance’s First Amendment argument head-on in Friday’s filing. “The Act does not warrant heightened First Amendment scrutiny because it does not impose a burden on any cognizable First Amendment rights of ByteDance, its U.S. subsidiary, or TikTok’s users,” lawyers for the department wrote. “The Act satisfies any level of First Amendment scrutiny, and this Court should uphold it,” they added. If the Supreme Court doesn’t act by Jan. 19 or sides with the U.S. government, TikTok would be banned just one day before Trump is inaugurated, something he pointed out in his own filing in the case late last month. “President Trump takes no position on the underlying merits of this dispute. Instead, he respectfully requests that the Court consider staying the Act’s deadline for divestment of January 19, 2025, while it considers the merits of this case,” Sauer wrote. Still, on his own social media platform, TruthSocial, Trump has been outspoken in his opposition to banning TikTok. On Friday morning, he wrote, “Why would I want to get rid of TikTok?” alongside a digital graphic showing that his TikTok account has received more views than the accounts of Vice President Kamala Harris, conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, Fox News, and pop stars Taylor Swift and Beyonce. NBC News has not independently verified the accuracy of this chart. The Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments in the case on Jan. 10, just nine days before the app is set to be banned under the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which passed Congress with bipartisan support last year and was subsequently signed by President Joe Biden. The law imposes a ban on the app only if ByteDance, a Chinese company, is still the owner of TikTok, effectively pushing ByteDance to sell the app to a U.S.-based company to allow the app to continue operating here. “Nothing in the Act would prevent a post-divestiture TikTok from presenting exactly the same content in exactly the same manner. The Act targets control by a foreign adversary, not protected speech,” Justice Department lawyers wrote in Friday’s filing. A spokesperson for Trump’s transition team did not immediately respond to requests for comment. This article was originally published on NBCNews.com",1.3k,[],2025-01-06 04:04:58,2025-01-06 19:30:24

https://www.yahoo.com/news/biden-block-offshore-drilling-along-175522099.html,Biden to block new offshore drilling along most US coastline,,Politics,Politico,5 min read,The move may complicate Republican efforts to speed lease sales for oil and gas exploration in federal waters.,Zack Colman,2025-01-04T17:55:22.000Z,"President Joe Biden is planning to prohibit future offshore oil and gas drilling along most of the nation’s coastline, setting up a potential roadblock for Republicans’ plans to expand production in federal waters. Biden is set to announce on Monday that he will withdraw 625 million acres of coastline from future oil and gas drilling. That would encompass all of the Atlantic Coast and eastern Gulf of Mexico, the Pacific coast from Washington to California and parts of Alaska’s Northern Bering Sea, according to a person briefed on the matter but who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The move tees up a fight over offshore energy as President-elect Donald Trump plans to turbocharge domestic oil and gas production as part of his pledge to cut U.S. energy costs in half in the first 18 months of his presidency. Biden’s prohibitions on leasing will rely on powers under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which withstood its only major legal challenge when a federal court in 2019 denied the Trump administration’s attempt to unwind an Obama administration withdrawal of areas for offshore oil and gas drilling near Alaska. That ruling will complicate Trump’s ability to rescind the upcoming action, leaving it to Congress to overturn. The White House and the Interior Department did not respond to requests for comment. Although most of the areas covered under the presidential memorandums have drawn little interest from the oil and gas industry, the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico is believed to hold large untapped reservoirs of oil. Opening that area to exploration has long drawn opposition from Florida officials from both parties — as well as Trump, who prohibited leasing there through 2032 under his own 2020 memorandum. Republicans are huddling to write broad spending legislation expected to include requirements that the Interior Department speed the pace of oil and gas lease sales — including in the Gulf of Mexico, which is responsible for 14 percent of U.S. oil output. They aim to move those measures using budget reconciliation, which allows the bill to pass with a simple majority in both chambers, avoiding the need to attract Democratic votes. But some experts anticipate Florida Republicans will seek to exploit their party’s thin majority to strengthen the prohibition on leasing in the eastern Gulf of Mexico — potentially delivering a parting victory for Biden and his environmental legacy. “These are areas where drilling is not popular, and these people want to see their coastal economies protected, their wildlife protected,” said Jenny Rowland-Shea, director of public lands at left-leaning think tank Center for American Progress. “I would find it quite unlikely that Republicans could come in and decide to open up all of these places where there hasn't been drilling in the past for new drilling and new lease sales without having some serious pushback.” Trump’s first term move to prevent leasing off the Florida coast and along South Carolina and Georgia acknowledged the opposition in those states. But energy industry executives said Trump’s actions were more targeted, while Biden’s step would be permanent. They noted oil and gas demand is rising globally, and said blocking development in the U.S. merely shifts production to geopolitical rivals and nations with fewer environmental safeguards. “Voters made their views clear about the importance of American energy yet the Biden administration’s misguided approach continues to undermine our nation’s energy advantage,” Dustin Meyer, senior vice president of policy, economics and regulatory policy at the American Petroleum Institute, said in a statement. Republicans expect to call for new oil and gas lease sales to help pay for its budget reconciliation package, which aims to extend expiring tax cuts and expand immigration enforcement efforts, said a Republican congressional aide familiar with negotiations who was granted anonymity to speak about fluid discussions. But those lease sales are likely to focus on areas where drilling faces little opposition rather than places like the Atlantic Coast, the aide said. Florida Republicans’ opposition to opening the eastern Gulf of Mexico divided the House Republican caucus last Congress when it tried to pass its signature energy legislation, H.R. 1 (118). Florida members demanded protections against drilling to back expanded lease sales elsewhere in the Gulf, said a former Republican aide who was granted anonymity to shed light on internal debates. “The eastern Gulf was a real challenge during H.R. 1, and with a smaller majority they’re going to need everything they can in order to get members to the table,” the aide said. “I wouldn't be surprised if there’s another push from Floridians to address this issue in reconciliation.” Environmental advocates are counting on Florida and other coastal Republicans to buck their party if the caucus tries to hold mandatory lease sales and reverse Biden’s actions. But it does not preclude Republicans from pushing more lease sales in areas Biden’s order does not touch where drilling is already taking place, such as the central and western Gulf of Mexico. “Although there will certainly be an effort and there will be expansion of drilling likely under their leadership, they also didn't drill in a lot of these areas,” Joseph Gordon, climate and energy campaign director with Oceana, said of past Republican congresses and Trump. “President Trump withdrew a vast area of the Southeast from drilling. So we're hopeful that there still will be the opportunity to work in a bipartisan way to protect our coast.” Greenlighting more lease sales through legislation would follow a recent trend. The Inflation Reduction Act, which Democrats passed by the same budget reconciliation process in 2022, required the Biden administration to hold regular lease sales in the central and western Gulf of Mexico, although Republicans have accused Biden of slow-walking the process to ready those lease sales. The oil and gas industry is likely to challenge a total ban in the Atlantic and Pacific in the courts even if they have no immediate interest in drilling there — if only to keep that option available, said an energy industry lobbyist. But the nation’s most lucrative plays are in the Gulf of Mexico, with some producers eyeing western slices of the eastern Gulf of Mexico where they could still tap existing infrastructure from the central Gulf. “The Floridians will wave their arms and be all melodramatic, but it’s whatever Trump wants,” the energy industry source said.",153,[],2025-01-06 04:04:58,2025-01-06 19:10:43

Beside Bezos, who founded Amazon before buying the Post, the cartoon portrayed caricatures of Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg, Los Angeles Times owner Patrick Soon-Shiong and Walt Disney Co mascot Mickey Mouse. “The cartoon … criticizes the billionaire tech and media chief executives who have been doing their best to curry favor with … Trump,” Telnaes said. “While it isn’t uncommon for editorial page editors to object to visual metaphors within a cartoon if it strikes that editor as unclear or isn’t correctly conveying the message intended by the cartoonist, such editorial criticism was not the case regarding this cartoon. “To be clear, there have been instances where sketches have been rejected or revisions requested, but never because of the point of view inherent in the cartoon’s commentary. That’s a gamechanger … and dangerous for a free press.” Telnaes announced her resignation less than three months after the Post and Bezos faced withering backlash over the outlet’s decision to prevent its editorial team from publishing an endorsement of Kamala Harris in the presidential election of 5 November. Soon-Shiong had also similarly refused to allow the LA Times’ editorial board to publish an endorsement of Harris. Readers met both outlets with more than 200,000 subscription cancellations combined, the overwhelming majority of those affecting the Post’s larger readership, according to reports. And commentators accused the two newspapers of demonstrating what has been classified as “anticipatory obedience” to Trump after he had repeatedly accused the media of being enemies of the state and promised retribution against many in the industry if he defeated Harris. Trump then scored a decisive victory against Harris to wrest back the Oval Office, which he had lost to Joe Biden in the 2020 election. After Trump’s victory, Zuckerberg dined with Trump at the president-elect’s Mar-a-Lago resort. His company, Meta, also donated $1m to a fund for Trump’s second inauguration. Observers interpreted those to be conciliatory gestures after Trump during his first presidency criticized Zuckerberg and his Facebook platform of being “anti-Trump”. Meanwhile, in December, ABC News – which is owned by Disney – and its anchor George Stephanopoulos agreed to pay $15m to a foundation and museum to be established by Trump to settle a defamation lawsuit the president-elect had filed against the network. Related: LA Times owner asks editorial board to ‘take a break’ from writing about Trump – report Stephanopoulos and his employer also agreed Stephanopoulos would express regret over on-air statements that he made in March claiming Trump had been found “liable for rape” in a lawsuit pursued against him by the columnist E Jean Carroll. A jury found Trump “had sexually abused” Carroll under New York law but stopped short of finding that he raped her. Trump subsequently was ordered to pay Carroll $5m. He also was ordered to pay her $83.3m after being found liable on defamation claims. Trump’s appeals of both those orders remained pending as of Saturday. Telnaes won the prestigious Pulitzer for illustrated reporting and commentary in 2001 – coincidentally, while working for the LA Times Syndicate – and was a finalist in the same category for the Post in 2022.

She attended the Republican National Convention in July and was linked to Trump Jr. in September. Bettina Anderson was already well-known in Palm Beach, Florida, for her prominent banking family, her fashion modeling, and her passion for environmental conservation and charity work. Then, she was photographed on what appeared to be romantic outings with Donald Trump Jr. Trump Jr. has not officially confirmed his breakup with fiancée Kimberly Guilfoyle nor commented on his relationship with Anderson. Neither has Anderson publicly acknowledged her connection to Trump Jr. beyond tagging him in an Instagram story. If they are, in fact, romantically linked, Anderson and Trump Jr. could next be spotted together at the White House during President-elect Donald Trump's second term. Here are seven things to know about Anderson's upbringing, career, and connection to the Trump family. Bettina Anderson grew up in Palm Beach, Florida, and comes from a prominent family. Anderson's father, Harry Loy Anderson, became the youngest bank president in the US in 1970 when he took over Worth Avenue National Bank at 26 years old. He was also a philanthropist who supported numerous charitable causes including the American Red Cross, of which he was a board member. He died of Alzheimer's in 2013 at 70 years old, according to his obituary. Her mother, Inger Anderson, is a philanthropist and business owner who operates Palm Beach Groves, an orange orchard and souvenir shop that she and her husband bought in 1978. Anderson, 38, grew up on a Palm Beach estate known as Oasis Cottage that once belonged to fashion designer Lilly Pulitzer Rousseau. Inger Anderson sold the state for $11.88 million in 2016, the Palm Beach Daily News reported. Anderson has five siblings, including a twin sister. Anderson is an Ivy League graduate. Anderson earned a bachelor's degree in art history from Columbia University in 2009, according to her LinkedIn profile. She's worked as a business development professional as well as a model and influencer. Anderson's résumé includes working as a business development manager for the pharmaceutical company TherapeuticsMD and as an independent consultant for the Florida-based investment company Merrick Ventures. She has modeled for Quest Magazine, Palm Beach Illustrated, and Modern Luxury Palm Beach, in which she was referred to as an ""ambassador of Palm Beach style and local 'it' girl."" Anderson also has over 51,000 followers on Instagram, where her profile features affiliate links to skincare products and her Amazon Shop. She co-founded an environmental charity with her siblings called Project Paradise. Project Paradise funds filmmaking grants for documentaries about environmental conservation. The organization released a short documentary, ""The Water State,"" calling attention to the fragility of Florida's freshwater springs. ""One of the greatest focuses of my life is how I can be of service to others and a be steward of the environment,"" Anderson told fashion blog The Daily Front Row in 2022. Anderson also volunteers with the Literacy Coalition of Palm Beach County and is a young patron of The Everglades Foundation. Anderson attended the Republican National Convention in July, months before she was first linked to Donald Trump Jr. in September. At the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Anderson was seated behind Donald Trump Jr., Kimberly Guilfoyle, and other members of the Trump family. In September, the Daily Mail reported that Anderson and Trump Jr. were seen kissing and eating brunch together in Palm Beach. Neither responded to a request for comment about the nature of their relationship. She co-hosted a fundraiser for Donald Trump's 2024 campaign at Mar-a-Lago in October. The event featured former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Vivek Ramaswamy, all of whom went on to become members of Trump's administration. Attending the dinner cost $100,000 per couple, and admission to a fireside chat cost $30,000 per couple, the Palm Beach Daily News reported. She has not publicly confirmed that she's dating Trump Jr., but she has featured him on her Instagram and joined him at Mar-a-Lago. On her birthday in December, Anderson posted a photo of a bouquet of flowers on an Instagram Story and tagged Trump Jr. The card accompanying the flowers read, ""Many have said you're aging out but I think you're perfect...happy birthday!"" Anderson and Trump Jr. were also photographed holding hands while exiting a restaurant in Palm Beach and celebrating Trump Jr.'s birthday together at Mar-a-Lago on New Year's Eve. Trump Jr. has not confirmed his breakup with Guilfoyle, but told Page Six in a statement that he and Guilfoyle ""will always keep a special bond"" and that he ""could not be more proud of her and the important role she'll continue to play in my father's administration"" as ambassador to Greece.

Scholz was reacting after Musk, a close ally to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, called the chancellor a “fool” after his coalition government collapsed in November and later backed the AfD in an opinion piece he wrote for a major newspaper in Germany. Scholz, head of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), said in comments published Saturday by the German magazine Stern that there is “nothing new” in criticism by “rich media entrepreneurs who do not appreciate social democratic politics and do not hold back with their opinions.” See for yourself — The Yodel is the go-to source for daily news, entertainment and feel-good stories. By signing up, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Policy. “You have to stay cool,” Scholz told Stern. “I find it much more worrying than such insults that Musk is supporting a party like the AfD, which is in parts right-wing extremist, which preaches rapprochement with Putin’s Russia and wants to weaken transatlantic relations,” Scholz said. The AfD is monitored by Germany’s domestic intelligence service on suspicion of being right-wing extremist and has already been recognized as such in some individual German states. Germany will hold an early parliamentary electionon Feb. 23 after Scholz’s thee-party coalition collapsed in November in a dispute over how to revitalize the country’s stagnant economy. The vice chancellor and economy minister, Robert Habeck, also warned Musk against getting involved in Germany's politics. “Hands off our democracy, Mr. Musk!” Habeck said in an interview with the Spiegel magazine. “The combination of enormous wealth, control over information and networks, the use of artificial intelligence and the willingness to ignore rules is a frontal attack on our democracy,” said Habeck, the Green Party's candidate for chancellor. Musk recently caused uproar after backing the AfD in an opinion piece for the Welt am Sonntag, leading to the resignation of the paper’s opinion editor, Eva Marie Kogel, in protest. “The Alternative for Germany (AfD) is the last spark of hope for this country,” Musk wrote in his translated commentary. The Tesla Motors CEO also wrote that his investment in Germany gave him the right to comment on the country’s condition. The AfD is polling strongly, but its candidate for the top job, Alice Weidel, has no realistic chance of becoming chancellor because other parties refuse to work with the far-right party.",372,[],2025-01-06 04:04:58,2025-01-06 04:04:58

The defendant, Russell Taylor, was accused of organizing a group of ""fighters"" to travel to D.C. on Jan. 6, 2021. In 2023, he pleaded guilty to obstructing an official proceeding, and he went on to cooperate with the government by providing testimony against the Three Percenters militia. U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth said in a Friday order that ""the particular nature and severity of Mr. Taylor’s conduct at the Capitol Riots counsel against giving him the permission to travel that he now seeks,"" running through a list of Taylor's actions prior to and during the attack on the Capitol. ""To attend the Presidential Inauguration, which celebrates and honors the peaceful transfer of power, is an immense privilege,"" Lamberth said. ""It would not be appropriate for the Court to grant permission to attend such a hallowed event to someone who carried weapons and threatened police officers in an attempt to thwart the last Inauguration, and who openly glorified '[i]nsurrection' against the United States,"" he added. When reached for comment, Taylor's attorney Dyke E. Huish said that Taylor was ""disappointed"" but has the ""utmost respect"" for the judge and his decisions. Lamberth ""has continued to treat my client with respect and given him fair consideration,"" Huish said in a statement. ""While this ruling is disappointing, as my client is a huge supporter of president elect Trump, he does understand the court denial of his request."" Huish added that Taylor will watch the inauguration on television at home, noting that they do not have plans to appeal the judge's decision. A spokesperson for the U.S. attorney's office for D.C. referred to prosecutors' previous filings. The office filed a motion in December opposing Taylor's request to travel to D.C., urging the court to ""not look past his criminal conduct the last time he was on Capitol grounds."" Former Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, wrote in a December letter to the judge that he and three current members of the Utah congressional delegation were inviting Taylor to the inauguration, though Stewart did not specify which representatives were extending the invitation. ""He is admired by many, and especially those in his community. Russ’ passion for what is right and good is reflected in his intentions to lift others,"" Stewart said in his letter praising Taylor. Huish filed a request on Dec. 11 asking Lamberth to allow Taylor to travel to Washington for the inauguration. In his letter, Huish wrote that Taylor ""has remained compliant with all Court Orders and has not given any indications of trouble or concern,"" adding that Taylor ""has demonstrated over and over again that he is trustworthy in his travel."" Taylor’s sentence required him to get permission before leaving parts of California, where he lives. Taylor had been sentenced to periods of probation and home confinement. In his Friday order, Lamberth noted that Taylor had taken ""responsibility for his actions and furnished extensive assistance to the Government,"" both reasons for his lighter sentence compared to those of other Jan. 6 defendants. ""But Mr. Taylor’s cooperation and good conduct while on probation do not diminish the seriousness of his acts on January 6, 2021, to which he has voluntary admitted, nor do they entitle him to the permission he now seeks,"" Lamberth said. Taylor is not the only Jan. 6 defendant to seek permission to travel to the inauguration. Other defendants who have put in requests include Christopher Belliveau, whose request was denied; Eric Peterson, whose request was granted; and William Pope, who has not yet received a decision on his request, according to court records.

Judge Juan Merchan said Trump can appear in person or virtually for the sentencing, and that he won't order Trump jailed. “While this Court as a matter of law must not make any determination on sentencing prior to giving the parties and Defendants opportunity to be heard, it seems proper at this juncture to make known the Court’s inclination to not impose any sentence of incarceration, a sentence authorized by the conviction but one the People concede they no longer view as a practicable recommendation,” the judge wrote in his ruling. Merchan said that ""a sentence of an unconditional discharge appears to be the most viable solution to ensure finality and allow Defendant to pursue his appellate options."" Such a sentence would allow the conviction to stand but without Trump being fined, locked up or having to serve probation. The judge denied Trump's request to vacate the verdict. ""Here, 12 jurors unanimously found Defendant guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records with the intent to defraud, which included an intent to commit or conceal a conspiracy to promote a presidential election by unlawful means,"" he wrote. Trump was convicted in May of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment his then-attorney Michael Cohen paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the closing days of the 2016 presidential election. ""It was the premediated and continuous deception by the leader of the free world that is the gravamen of this offense,"" Merchan wrote. ""To vacate this verdict on the grounds that the charges are insufficiently serious given the position Defendant once held, and is about to assume again, would constitute a disproportionate result and cause immeasurable damage to the citizenry's confidence in the Rule of Law,"" the judge added. Trump lambasted the judge, the ruling and the case overall in posts to Truth Social on Friday night. ""This illegitimate political attack is nothing but a Rigged Charade,"" he argued, going on to claim that the judge's order ""would be the end of the Presidency as we know it."" ""It is time to end the Lawfare once and for all,"" Trump added in a separate post, using his preferred term for cases he believes are politically motivated. Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung called the ruling ""a direct violation of the Supreme Court’s Immunity decision and other longstanding jurisprudence. This lawless case should have never been brought and the Constitution demands that it be immediately dismissed."" ""There should be no sentencing, and President Trump will continue fighting against these hoaxes until they are all dead,” he added. It's unclear whether Trump plans to appear for the sentencing, either in person or virtually. The judge left open the possibility of sentencing him when his term in office is done — an alternative that had been suggested by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office. Merchan said he found that option ""less desirable than imposing sentence prior to January 20, 2025. The reasons are obvious. However, if the Court is unable to impose sentence before Defendant takes his oath of office, then this may become the only viable option."" The DA's office declined to comment. Merchan denied another bid to dismiss the case last month, when Trump argued he was already protected by presidential immunity given his status as president-elect. Trump was initially scheduled to be sentenced in the case back in July, but the proceeding was delayed multiple times at the request of Trump's lawyers, first because of a Supreme Court ruling that created a new standard for presidential immunity and later because of Trump's election win.

Minutes after Miami's season-ending loss to the New York Jets on Sunday, the All-Pro wide receiver indicated to reporters he no longer wants to play for the team that traded for him three seasons ago and gave him a record-breaking $120 million contract. His words: ""This is my first time I haven't been in the playoffs, man. So I just got to do what's best for me and my family. If that's here or wherever the case may be, I'm finna open that door for myself. I'm opening the door. I'm out, bro. It was great playing here, but at the end of the day I gotta do what's best for my career because I'm too much of a competitor to be just out there."" When outright asked if he was thinking about leaving Miami, Hill began to answer before walking away. Dolphins receiver Tyreek Hill basically said he wanted out of the Dolphins organization after the game. pic.twitter.com/gIiMv7Edaf — Omar Kelly (@OmarKelly) January 6, 2025 He proceeded to seemingly double down on social media, posting what certainly looked like a goodbye message on X. Love fin nation blessing yall opened doors for the Hill family forever nothing ,but respect and love — Ty Hill (@cheetah) January 6, 2025 Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel declined to offer a firm response when told about Hill's statement, but conceded he would like to have a team of players who would like to be there: “I think there will be conversations that will be direct in the next couple days, which is the process of the end-of-season meetings. Obviously, there’s a lot of power in having a team that wants to play together and go for a common goal. That's inherent, but I'm not going to put too much weight on second-hand postgame disappointment statements.” Hill is coming off one of the worst seasons of his career, and easily his worst with the Dolphins. Not coincidentally, it was a rough year for the Dolphins, who missed the playoffs for the first time of McDaniel's tenure while dealing with considerable injuries. After topping 1,700 receiving yards in his first two seasons in Miami, Hill failed to clear 1,000 yards and posted his worst yards per-game mark since his rookie year with the Kansas City Chiefs. Hill is under contract for the next two seasons, with a cap number of $27.7 million in 2025 and $51.9 million in 2026 per OverTheCap. If the Dolphins really pull the trigger on a trade, it would be the second contentious exit of Hill's career. He famously asked for a trade from the Chiefs after a contract extension failed to materialize, jumping ship from a team that won a Super Bowl two seasons earlier. The Chiefs have obviously done fine without him, winning back-to-back Super Bowls and going 15-2 this season. The Dolphins paid dearly to acquire Hill, sending a first-round pick, a second-round pick, two fourth-round picks and a sixth-round pick to Kansas City just for the right to give Hill that $120 million deal, which reset the wide receiver market. He did seem worth it, operating as the most dangerous weapon of McDaniel's high-octane offense, but now it's hard to say where they go from here.",1.2k,[],2025-01-06 04:04:58,2025-01-09 00:30:21

Fresh off the New Year, the 2025 Golden Globes are set to bring out some of the biggest names in film and television for a night of Hollywood glitz and glamour. Comedian Nikki Glaser will take centre stage as host of the 82nd Golden Globe Awards on Sunday, Jan. 5 at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, Calif. The crime musical Emilia Pérez starring Zoe Saldaña leads the pack this year with 10 nominations, followed by Demi Moore’s The Substance and the independent film Anora with five nods each. The Bear earned the most nominations on the television front with five nominations including Best Musical or Comedy Television Series, followed by Only Murders in the Building and Shōgun with four nominations apiece. With powerhouse stars like Nicole Kidman, Ariana Grande, Zendaya and Timothée Chalamet nominated for awards, this year's red carpet is sure to be a visual feast for fans and fashion lovers. Ahead of this year's awards, we're looking back at some of the best — and worst — red carpet moments from the Golden Globes. Stone celebrated her Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy win for La La Land in a baby pink celestial print Valentino gown. There's no denying that Sarah Jessica Parker is a fashion and television icon. Although we love that the Sex and the City star isn't afraid to take risks on the red carpet, this Princess Leia-inspired look is one that belongs in a galaxy far, far away. In 2007, Reese Witherspoon's turn at the Golden Globes red carpet was her first public appearance following her divorce from actor Ryan Phillippe. The star looked better than ever thanks to a new hair style and eye-catching canary yellow dress by Nina Ricci. Even Nicole Kidman thinks this '20s-inspired YSL Rive Gauche by Tom Ford dress is one of her ""train wreck"" red carpet moments. In a new interview with W Magazine, Kidman admitted the gold headdress from the 2004 Golden Globes was a fashion faux pas, saying, ""I didn’t know what I was doing."" Lupita Nyong'o always delivers memorable fashion moments on the red carpet. However, the Black Panther star's indigo coloured fringe dress by Calvin Klein is one dazzling look that we can't get enough of. Cameron Diaz hit the red carpet to celebrate her nomination for There's Something About Mary in an ill-fitting tapestry-inspired look by Chloé that she paired with black trousers. Although the look was straight off the runway, it failed to translate to the red carpet, and has become one of Diaz's most memorable fashion fails. Scarlett Johansson aced the red carpet at the 2020 Golden Globes in a show-stopping look by Vera Wang. The Marriage Story star and the rich scarlet red gown were a match made in fashion heaven, and included 120 carats of Bulgari diamonds. Jennifer Lopez stole the spotlight for all the wrong reasons at the 2020 Golden Globe Awards. The Hustlers actress's bizarre Maison Valentino gown whipped fans into a frenzy thanks to its gigantic bows that overpowered the superstar. Angelina Jolie looked glamorous in an ivory gown with bold red asymmetrical detail by Atelier Versace at the 2012 Golden Globe Awards. The finishing touch? Her infamous pout in a matching ruby red lipstick. When it comes to fashion, Jennifer Lawrence is a faithful fan of Dior. Although their partnership has delivered some standout red carpet looks, the star's strapless look at the 2014 Golden Globes looked less like a high fashion offering and more like a dress from the bedding aisle at Bed Bath and Beyond. Margot Robbie's hot pink sequinned look inspired by 1977's Superstar Barbie was a standout moment from the Barbie press tour. Armani recreated the look, including a version in black for Robbie to wear to after parties. With the right styling, Sandra Bullock's pink Jenny Packham gown at the 2011 Golden Globes could have been a red carpet hit. However, the star's heavy fringe and accessories overwhelm Bullock, who gets lost in the look. In 2019, the Beautiful Boy actor hit the red carpet in a sequinned harness by Virgil Abloh for Louis Vuitton that perfectly showcased the star's edgy fashion sense. Lara Flynn Boyle's ballerina look is to the Golden Globes red carpet what Björk's swan dress is to the Oscars: infamous. The Ally McBeal star's look has become a memorable fashion miss that we're still talking about more than twenty years on. In 2010, Drew Barrymore accepted the Golden Globe for her role in Grey Gardens wearing an asymmetrical jewel-encrusted gown by Atelier Versace. Gwyneth Paltrow's sheer gown at the 2020 Golden Globes was an odd choice for the actress and Goop founder. The diamond necklaces under the sheer neckline made this a high fashion look that didn't quite translate to the glamour of the red carpet. Sandra Oh looked glamorous in a white asymmetrical look by Versace as she arrived to the 2019 Golden Globes. It was a busy night for the Canadian actress. The Killing Eve star picked up an award for her role and co-hosted the event alongside Andy Samberg. Diane Kruger's Marchesa look at the 2005 Golden Globe Awards was far from conventional. The two piece ensemble with asymmetrical sash stood out from the crowd for all the wrong reasons. Kate Hudson's boho-inspired Valentino gown at the 2003 Golden Globes could have easily been a red carpet disaster. However, the minimalist styling and Hudson's wild curls make this strapless look one of her best red carpet moments of all time. Sharon Stone hit the red carpet in an edgy Valentino look that featured a sheer sequinned top and matching mini skirt that featured various lengths of black tulle. The ensemble remains one of Stone's most memorable looks and at the same time, one we wish we could forget. Let us know what you think by commenting below and tweeting @YahooStyleCA!

They got neither.,jori epstein,2025-01-06T00:39:44.000Z,"EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — The Miami Dolphins’ playoff hopes needed two things this weekend: their own win and a Denver Broncos loss. On the final Sunday of the NFL regular season, they got neither. With a 32-20 loss to the New York Jets, the Dolphins failed to make the NFL playoffs for the first time in head coach Mike McDaniels’ tenure. Their 8-9 year follows consecutive seasons of wildcard losses, this year’s injury-riddle season also cut short by the Denver Broncos’ 38-0 win over the Kansas City Chiefs. The Jets finished the year 5-12 as their defense forced a damaging four takeaways and 40-year-old Aaron Rodgers showed potential suitors what the four-time MVP has left to offer. Rodgers posted the first four-touchdown of his Jets tenure, including his 500th career TD pass, in what could be the last game of his Jets, if not also NFL, tenure. Aaron Rodgers has thrown for four touchdowns in 30 prior games. But none since his 2021 MVP season — until tonight, which could be his Jets (or NFL?) finale. pic.twitter.com/GifeRzCwqa — Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) January 6, 2025 The Dolphins were fighting for their playoff lives without franchise quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, who was sidelined with a hip injury. They entered the game averaging 24 points with him compared to 11 without, per TruMedia. Add ball security to the list of problems plaguing an anemic offense. Backup quarterback Tyler Huntley didn’t just struggle to extend drives — he turned the ball over on three straight drives before halftime, allowing New York to recover a lead they wouldn’t give up. Near kickoff, it seemed the Jets were bound for the sloppy day the Dolphins ended up claiming.

When the game began, misdirection continued: Rodgers targeted longtime receiver and friend Davante Adams on his first pass attempt, but safety Jevon Holland wrapped Adams and jarred the ball loose. Linebacker Tyrel Dodson grabbed the loose ball, returning it seven yards to set the Dolphins up for a field goal and the first points of the game. Miami would add another field goal before the Jets’ next first down, thanks to a 61-yard De'Von Achane explosion. But in the spirit of the field goal Miami settled for after Achane’s run set them up for first down at the 3-yard line, the Dolphins were not done coughing up opportunities. Miami’s defense allowed Rodgers to complete passes to five different targets on the second-quarter drive in which he ultimately found Tyler Conklin in the end zone. The touchdown gave the Jets the lead, and it gave Rodgers his 500th touchdown. Rodgers joined Tom Brady, Drew Brees, Peyton Manning and Brett Favre as the only players in NFL history to throw 500 touchdown passes.

Huntley’s sideline lob to Jaylen Waddle landed instead in the hands of Jets safety Ashtyn Davis, Huntley next losing a strip sack on third-and-12 the following drive. The short field positioned Rodgers for Touchdown 501. And then? The Jets defense intercepted a Huntley-to-Waddle attempt yet again. Only the Jets scored in the third quarter, as Huntley lost yet another fumble on a strip-sack. The Dolphins didn’t need to speculate on the viability of their postseason hopes as the fourth quarter elapsed: Jumbotrons lighting up the northeast and southwest corners of the stadium projected the Broncos’ 38-point lead across the country. The Dolphins’ brightest spot flashed again, with Achane rushing for a 15-yard touchdown to open the team’s final period of the season. But like their postseason hopes, it was too little, too late. Rodgers found Adams for touchdown 502 to extend the league. Huntley completed 21 of 35 passes for 192 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions. Achane added 121 yards and a touchdown rushing. Rodgers completed 22 of 34 passes for 268 yards, four touchdowns and an interception. The Jets’ final game result — the win column that eluded them for so much of the season — clarified late Sunday, but almost every major piece of their future remains murky. The franchise already began interviewing head coach and general manager candidates, after in-season firings of Robert Saleh and Joe Douglas, respectively. Their pursuit of a head coach may face another wrench after the division-rival New England Patriots fired first-year coach Jerod Mayo during the Jets’ finale. The Patriots could be a natural fit for coaching candidate Mike Vrabel, whom the Jets interviewed on Friday. The team’s next leadership group will have several decisions to make, beginning with the future of Rodgers. Miami, meanwhile, leaves another season disappointed. Tagovailoa played well when healthy in 11 games, completing a league-high 72.9% of passes as he threw for 2,867 yards, 19 touchdowns and seven interceptions. But the quarterback Miami extended last summer missed six games due to a concussion and hip injury. Ensuring Tagovailoa’s health in 2025 will be crucial for the Dolphins to get over the playoff hump. And he might not have one of his top weapons in receiver Tyreek Hill back next year after Hill's ominous postgame comments on Sunday. Miami also could be looking for a third defensive coordinator in three years if Anthony Weaver, who is expected to generate interview interest, is hired as a head coach.",124,[],2025-01-06 04:04:58,2025-01-09 00:30:30

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-problems-for-the-stock-price-of-nvidia-rival-amd-133029633.html,3 problems for the stock price of Nvidia rival AMD,,Business,Yahoo Finance,4 min read,AMD's stock has hit the skids. Will it come out of hibernation soon?,Brian Sozzi    · Executive Editor,2025-01-06T12:42:37.000Z,"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings In the past 10 years of my life, a few things have been constant. One, I can't seem to drink enough water to support my insanely grueling workouts. Two, Nvidia's (NVDA) stock price usually only goes up. Three, rival chip player AMD's (AMD) stock price usually only goes up. And four, I don't get enough sleep. Happy to say three of those constants held, well, constant in 2024. The one that didn't? The stock price of now former highflier AMD finished the year down 17%. By comparison, Nvidia advanced 171% in 2024, Broadcom (AVGO) rose 107%, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) tacked on 28%. AMD was the ninth most popular stock (Nvidia was No. 1) held in retail investor portfolios last year, according to data from Vanda Research. The stock, on average, made up 2.07% of the average retail investor's portfolio, down from 3.37% at the start of 2024. AMD's stock price performance is astonishing if you ask me, given 1) the impressive earnings growth of the company; 2) top-notch innovation and execution on the chip front, which I was reminded of by AMD chair and CEO Lisa Su in a September chat; and 3) Intel (INTC) has fallen apart (more on that here from Yahoo Finance's Yasmin Khorram and Laura Bratton), allowing for more land-grab opportunities for AMD. ""It’s the view AMD is lost in the AI arms race behind Nvidia, and so far it's been disappointing,"" Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives told me. Ives makes a key point about AMD at this juncture. The stock is being driven more by perception than actual fundamentals and outlook. To that end, here are three problems I am seeing right now with AMD sentiment. The Nvidia effect: Nvidia's product pipeline — led by the new Blackwell chip now hitting markets — is viewed by the Street as being one year ahead of AMD in terms of artificial intelligence performance (something that may be on display in Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's CES keynote next week). This is seen as holding back market share gain opportunities for AMD. The cloud player effect: Major cloud players are increasingly opting for custom chips from Marvell (MRVL) and Broadcom. For example, Amazon (AMZN) has strongly indicated its preference for custom chips from its Trainium line and Marvell or for Nvidia products, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya pointed out. Separately, Google (GOOG) continues to prefer internal chips and those from Broadcom and Nvidia. Weak PC sales outlook: The outlook for the PC market in 2025 remains subdued at best, putting risk to AMD's estimates. Some on the Street have whispered the first half of 2025 could actually bring a PC market correction. AMD did little to help sentiment around its stock by guiding for fourth quarter earnings per share to be 8% below consensus when it reported earnings in late October. ""AMD's challenge (and opportunity) in calendar year 2025 will be to take share in enterprise PC where Intel is dominant, while fending off threat from ARM-based (Qualcomm) rivals,"" Arya wrote. Having said that, the fundamentals paint a different picture of AMD — and it raises the question if the stock has gotten too cheap. The company's new AI chip, dubbed the MI300, notched $1.5 billion in sales in the third quarter of 2024. It represented the fastest product to $1 billion in sales in a quarter ever for AMD. AMD guided to $5 billion in MI300 sales for 2024, up from $4.5 billion. The Street thinks this number could reach about $9.5 billion in 2025. Momentum on the AI chip front has AMD on pace for at least 50% earnings growth this year, based on analyst estimates on Yahoo Finance. If the PC market doesn't drop off and AI demand stays strong, AMD's earnings growth could be well north of 70%. ""We believe AMD is being underestimated for its AI potential,"" Ives contended. This embedded content is not available in your region. Looking at the stock's valuation, investors have forgotten that type of growth potential for AMD. The stock trades on a trailing price-to-earnings growth (PEG) ratio of 0.31 times, below 1 times for Nvidia and oddly below the 0.55 times afforded struggling Intel. AMD's forward price-to-earnings (PE) multiple of 24 times is also well under Nvidia's. And the stock is off by almost 50% from its 52-week high while competitors hover around record highs. ""We remain buyers based on our view that the company continues to gain traction as the #2 supplier of merchant accelerator solutions,"" Evercore ISI semiconductor analyst Mark Lipacis wrote. ""History shows that one ecosystem typically captures 70-80% of the value of each computing era, which we’ve argued would be Nvidia, leaving 20-30% of a rapidly growing market for AMD to prosecute as the only other merchant chip supplier. We like AMD’s strategy, which we view to be similar to its (successful) CPU strategy vs. Intel and focused on optimizing its solution for the high-volume AI workloads.""

Who will replace him?,jack baer · ryan young,2025-01-06T03:03:55.000Z,"Jerod Mayo is one and done as New England Patriots head coach, and that leaves one major question: Who on Earth is going to step into the building for the Patriots? It's never easy being the guy replacing a Hall of Famer, as Mayo did with Bill Belichick, but being the next guy in the chain won't be easy either in New England. A franchise that went nearly two decades without a losing season, with six Super Bowls along the way, is going to have sky-high expectations, no matter how the last few years went. The Patriots already have what is supposed to be their franchise quarterback in Drake Maye, as well as the fourth overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft. Mayo was fired for not immediately turning the team around after Belichick's leaner final years, and his replacement could face a similar mandate. Here are some guys we think could be up for it: This is the best place to start, as Vrabel is almost certainly going to be considered the favorite at first for this opening. Vrabel spent this past season working as a consultant with the Cleveland Browns after losing his job leading the Tennessee Titans, who he took to a pair of division titles and the AFC championship game over his six seasons in Nashville. But after he was fired following the 2023 campaign, he’s been considered a top-tier candidate for openings across the league. And, of course, he has plenty of connections with the Patriots. Vrabel spent eight seasons playing for the franchise, and he won three Super Bowls there alongside Tom Brady. He was even inducted into the team’s Hall of Fame in 2023, which was something that reportedly helped lead to his firing in Tennessee. Vrabel has already interviewed elsewhere in the league this cycle — he was reportedly in conversations with the New York Jets — and he’s sure to interview more in the near future, but the Patriots are undoubtedly a great fit for him personally. If there was a spot for Vrabel, who was once one of the hottest coaches in the league, to make his return, it’s in New England. For Johnson, it's not really a question if the Patriots should want him, but if he should want the Patriots. Johnson has been among the top head coaching candidates for three straight cycles now, and it's become clear he's not leaving Detroit for anything short of an ideal situation. The Patriots can try to sell him on their current situation, and it could be something that he started his coaching career at nearby Boston College, but that might not be enough. Helping the Patriots is that none of the other current coaching vacancies are ideal. The Jacksonville Jaguars are a mess, the New Orleans Saints are facing salary cap armageddon and the Chicago Bears still have widely maligned general manager Ryan Poles. Bears QB Caleb Williams would also have been a big draw for Chicago, had it not been for a disastrous rookie year. Like Vrabel, Flores has plenty of connections of his own in New England. He spent more than a decade working under Belichick there before he took over as the head coach with the Miami Dolphins. That job, however, ended after issues with the front office and quarterback Tua Tagovailoa. And Flores is still involved in a lawsuit with the league over racial discrimination. But since that tumultuous departure, Flores has thrived as the defensive coordinator with the Minnesota Vikings. He’s helped transform their defense into one of the best in the league. If Vrabel or Johnson aren’t the move for Kraft, Flores would be a perfect option here to lead the team long-term in the post Belichick era — especially if he lands a great OC to help direct Maye. Coen offers both an opportunity for both a young and up-and-coming coach at 39 years old and a local kid coming home. Coen grew up in Rhode Island, went to college at UMass and spent the first eight years of his coaching career at various New England colleges. Since then, he's become part of the Sean McVay coaching tree with the Los Angeles Rams and is coming off a successful first season calling plays for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Buccaneers ranked fourth in points scored and third in yards gained entering Sunday, after ranking 20th and 23rd in the previous season without Coen. He's become a buzzy coaching candidate, and the Patriots might be his most favored destination. Add one more former Belichick assistant to the pile. Tom Brady never threw for more yards with the Patriots than when O'Brien was offensive coordinator in 2011, and he's had no shortage of interesting jobs since then. He led the rebuild of Penn State, led the Houston Texans to four playoff berths, reached a national championship game as Alabama offensive coordinator, returned to the Patriots for a not-so-successful year as an assistant and just finished off a decent first year with Boston College. O'Brien has been around, finding plenty of success and critics along the way. On the bright side, he wouldn't have to move far if he got the job. Kingsbury is flirting with a second shot as a head coach in the league after his run with the Arizona Cardinals didn’t go great. He’s reportedly interested in the Chicago Bears opening, and the New York Jets are apparently open to him, too. While he finished with a losing record and made it to the postseason just once in his four years with the Cardinals, Kingsbury has been great as the Washington Commanders’ offensive coordinator this season. He’s helped the franchise and former Heisman Trophy winner Jayden Daniels to their first playoff appearance in four seasons while racking up double-digit wins for just the third time this century. If he could recreate that with Maye in New England, he'd be the perfect man for the job. Kingsbury could (and maybe should) stay with Washington for the near future and see how far he and Daniels can go with a team that looks like it could win a playoff game for the first time in almost 20 years. But, if he wants to be a head coach again, Kingsbury is at least worth a look from Kraft. This feels like a reach for Kraft, but Josh McCown wouldn’t be a terrible choice. McCown, who has helped lead Sam Darnold as the Vikings’ quarterbacks coach this season, has interviewed for head coaching jobs in the league in the past after his nearly two-decade run playing himself. And, perhaps most notably, he worked with Drake Maye when he was in high school. If Kraft is looking for someone to lead his franchise quarterback for years to come, McCown would definitely work. At a bare minimum, he needs to be looked at for their next offensive coordinator. Be honest, you thought about it too. This obviously isn't happening barring multiple changes of circumstance, though we're just going to note Belichick's buyout with UNC becomes only $1 million after June 1.",89,[],2025-01-06 04:05:56,2025-01-09 00:30:22

The parameters of that standoff are already making Donald Trump unhappy.,Ben Werschkul    · Washington Correspondent,2025-01-05T16:00:28.000Z,"A new debt ceiling was established this week, setting up a debate for the months ahead about averting a government default. The parameters of that coming standoff are already making Donald Trump unhappy. The issue for the president-elect is how events are conspiring — thanks to the nudging of both Democrats and far-right Republicans — to make the inevitable move by Trump and his allies to allow new governmental borrowing a messy one. Few can currently imagine that Republicans would actually allow a default to occur later this year. The GOP will have unified control of Washington’s levers of power within weeks and would be fully blamed for any default. What Trump wants to avoid are distractions from other parts of his sprawling 2025 economic agenda. In a recent social media post, Trump railed against the state of the debt ceiling and called the deal that put it on the 2025 agenda ""one of the dumbest political decisions made in years."" But the clock is nevertheless now ticking, with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently outlining the steps ahead for the debt limit and noting that so-called ""extraordinary measures"" could begin within days to avoid a default. The roadblock for Trump is how closely the debt ceiling issue is likely to become intertwined with other issues on his early agenda, which range from border measures to energy policy to tax cuts. ""It was Biden’s problem, [but] now it becomes ours,"" Trump acknowledged last week. He had previously hoped to take the debt ceiling off the table during December’s government shutdown standoff but was rebuffed by Democrats and 34 Republicans who ignored his call. Read more: How a government shutdown would impact your money: Student loans, Social Security, investments, and more A debt ceiling bill didn’t even get a majority and failed by a vote of 174-235, even as a follow-up bill passed overwhelmingly once the debt ceiling provision was removed. And House Speaker Mike Johnson may have made this year's debt ceiling standoff even more politically complex. He promised that a debt ceiling deal would happen through the reconciliation process and that it would pair a debt limit increase of $1.5 trillion with $2.5 trillion in cuts made to ""net mandatory spending."" That’s likely to be much easier said than done. On one hand, the hyper-partisan reconciliation process is likely to be opposed by all Democrats. Various Republican groups are also likely to be wary of a bill that includes deep mandatory cuts or any debt ceiling raises. According to a recent New York Times analysis, 29 current members of Congress have never voted for a debt ceiling increase and often take pride in that position. And Johnson — who this week is in a fight to retain his speaker's gavel — may be required to offer more concessions to this group in order to amass votes. On Thursday, Punchbowl News reported that Chip Roy, a Texas Republican and member of that group of 29, is set to hold significant sway over Johnson’s fate. It reported that Roy could extract concessions either through rule changes or even by being named to head a powerful rules committee. ""If you want to get a promise from Mike Johnson, you are going to want to get it in the next 24 hours."" Wendy Schiller, professor of public affairs at Brown University, said in a Yahoo Finance video interview Thursday morning. She added that what could perhaps be in jeopardy in the back-and-forth could be ""a safe debt ceiling approval later this spring."" Trump's own position on the debt ceiling issue is further complicated by the fact that he has often seemed to endorse a default when it would hurt his political opponents. ""I say to the Republicans out there — congressmen, senators — if they don’t give you massive cuts, you’re going to have to do a default,"" he offered as recently as 2023 as the GOP faced off against a Democratic White House. As the politics of the situation come into focus, the mechanics of the debt limit itself will begin to be felt within days. On Dec. 27, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen wrote a letter to congressional leaders explaining that the federal government will likely need to begin moving around cash in what are called ""extraordinary measures” sometime between Jan. 14 and Jan. 23. After that, it will essentially be an educated guessing game about when the moment comes that the effect of these measures run out — and a market-rattling default could be in the offing. One recent analysis from the Economic Policy Innovation Center authored by two former Republican Capitol Hill staffers suggested mid-June as the time to watch. That’s an estimate that Trump himself appears to have taken to heart, often citing June as the deadline. But the paper was quick to note that ""it is entirely possible that the debt ceiling will be reached prior to June 16, and the Congress will need to act earlier than many are expecting.""

This embedded content is not available in your region. Use the free Yahoo Finance mortgage calculator to see how various mortgage terms and interest rates will impact your monthly payments. Our calculator also considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when determining your estimated monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a more realistic idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest. The average 30-year mortgage rate today is 6.67%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is lower than with a shorter-term loan. The average 15-year mortgage rate is 6.00% today. When deciding between a 15-year and a 30-year mortgage, consider your short-term versus long-term goals. A 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to accumulate. But the trade-off is that your monthly payment will be higher as you pay off the same amount in half the time. Let’s say you get a $300,000 mortgage. With a 30-year term and a 6.67% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,930, and you’d pay $394,752 in interest over the life of your loan — on top of that original $300,000. If you get that same $300,000 mortgage but with a 15-year term and 6.00% rate, your monthly payment would jump up to $2,532. But you’d only pay $155,683 in interest over the years. With a fixed-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for the entire life of your loan. You will get a new rate if you refinance your mortgage, though. An adjustable-rate mortgage keeps your rate the same for a predetermined period of time. Then, the rate will go up or down depending on several factors, such as the economy and the maximum amount your rate can change according to your contract. For example, with a 7/1 ARM, your rate would be locked in for the first seven years, then change every year for the remaining 23 years of your term. Adjustable rates typically start lower than fixed rates, but once the initial rate-lock period ends, it’s possible your rate will go up. Lately, though, some fixed rates have been starting lower than adjustable rates. Talk to your lender about its rates before choosing one or the other. Dig deeper: Fixed-rate vs. adjustable-rate mortgages Mortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, great or excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So, if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes. Waiting for rates to drop probably isn’t the best method to get the lowest mortgage rate right now unless you are truly in no rush and don’t mind waiting until the end of 2024 or into 2025. If you’re ready to buy, focusing on your personal finances is probably the best way to lower your rate. To find the best mortgage lender for your situation, apply for mortgage preapproval with three or four companies. Just be sure to apply to all of them within a short time frame — doing so will give you the most accurate comparisons and have less of an impact on your credit score. When choosing a lender, don’t just compare interest rates. Look at the mortgage annual percentage rate (APR) — this factors in the interest rate, any discount points, and fees. The APR, which is also expressed as a percentage, reflects the true annual cost of borrowing money. This is probably the most important number to look at when comparing mortgage lenders. According to Zillow, the national average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.67%, and the average 15-year mortgage rate is 6.00%. But these are national averages, so the average in your area could be different. Averages are typically higher in expensive parts of the U.S. and lower in less expensive areas. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.67% right now, according to Zillow. However, you might get an even better rate with an excellent credit score, sizable down payment, and low debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Mortgage rates aren't expected to drop drastically in the near future, though they may inch down here and there. Refinance mortgage rates are now 6.28% for a 30-year term. Refinancing could land you a lower rate. Find out if rates are low enough for you to refinance. Learn how inflation and the latest inflation report affect mortgage rates. By watching inflation, you’ll be prepared for where interest rates are headed. Current 15-year mortgage rates are higher than last week but much lower than a year ago.

The Bears opened scoring on Sunday with a punt return for a touchdown aided by some well-executed misdirection. Midway through the first quarter, the Packers Daniel Whelan punted from the Chicago 44-yard-line. The punt traveled down the left sideline deep into Bears territory. But Chicago's punt return team set up down the right sideline and Green Bay's coverage unit followed. DJ Moore feigned a fair catch at the five-yard line, as the ball landed on the opposite side of the field. Meanwhile, Bears special teamer Josh Blackwell followed the punt uncovered down the left sideline. He fielded the punt inside the 10-yard line with nobody near him as Whelan appeared to be the only Packers player aware of which direction the punt actually traveled. By the time Whelan's teammates realized what was happening, Blackwell found a clear path down the sideline toward the end zone. He ran untouched for a 94-yard return to give the Bears an early 7-0 lead. He capped the play with a Lambeau Leap after spotting some Bears fans in the front row of the stands. The touchdown was the first of Blackwell's three-season NFL career. The return was just the seventh of the season for Blackwell, who's Chicago's secondary punt returner behind DeAndre Carter. At 4-12 entering Sunday's game, the Bears had long been eliminated from the playoff picture and had nothing to gain on Sunday with a win. But the rival Packers were playing for playoff positioning with a chance to move up from the No. 7 seed to the No. 6 seed in the NFC and a path that avoids playing the No. 2 and No. 1 seeds in the opening rounds of the playoffs. That was plenty of incentive for Chicago to unload the playbook in its final game of a lost season.",99,[],2025-01-06 04:05:56,2025-01-09 00:30:35

Their collision could unfold in multiple ways. If Trump’s economic policies cause more inflation, it could force the Fed to tap the brakes and pull back any expected interest rate cuts. The new administration could make some new noise about limiting the Fed’s independence. Or Trump cost-cutter Elon Musk — who recently said the central bank is ""absurdly overstaffed"" — could seek to overhaul the Fed’s workforce. The tensions between Trump and Powell were on display for much of 2024. On the campaign trail, Trump regularly criticized Powell, offering that the president should ""have a say"" in Fed decisions and that Powell has ""gotten it wrong a lot."" After Trump’s reelection win in November, Powell himself aggressively rebuffed the possibility of being removed before his term is up in May 2026. Read more: How much control does the president have over the Fed and interest rates? ""Not permitted under the law,"" the central bank chair said on Nov. 7 to reporters who asked about his views on any legal authorities Trump might have in terms of firing or demoting him. ""No,"" he said at another point in a press conference on the question of whether he would leave, sounding perturbed. Trump and Powell appear to be making an effort to sound more conciliatory as Inauguration Day draws closer. The president-elect said in Decemeber on NBC's Meet the Press that he has no plans to remove Powell before the Federal Reserve chair's term is up in May 2026. That came just days after Powell said that he hoped for a good relationship with the new Trump White House and Trump’s nominee for Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, who earlier this year suggested in an interview that Trump could appoint a ""shadow chair"" to undermine Powell’s influence. Whether this recent détente can last is still an open question, especially if the Fed reaches a point where it decides it has to start raising interest rates again. Powell and his colleagues said in December that they expect inflation to remain more elevated than previously thought — predicting it will end 2025 at 2.5% instead of a prior forecast of 2.2%. That revision caused the central bank to scale back the number of rate cuts it expects to make next year to two from four previously. If Trump’s proposed policies, from tariffs to tax cuts, cause more inflation, that could force the Fed to pull back even more on any easing — or even consider rate hikes. That likely wouldn’t make Trump happy. During his first term, then-President Trump attacked Powell with regularity (even though it was Trump who had elevated him to his current role) for not lowering rates far enough, even once suggesting negative interest rates. Trump also wasn’t afraid to talk about firing Powell, saying bluntly in a 2020 news conference that ""I have the right to remove"" him. The then-president added that he could also demote Powell from his position as chair, ""put him in a regular position, and put somebody else in charge."" Powell acknowledged last month his past public clashes with Trump, noting the tone remained consistent in private discussions. ""The president said the same things to me privately as he said publicly,"" Powell said on Dec. 4. But Powell said he is ""not concerned"" that the central bank could lose its independence during a new Trump administration. Powell has argued the Fed was created by Congress to be independent so it can make decisions for the benefit of Americans and not a particular political party. He has said there is ""very broad support” for that concept from both Republicans and Democrats. Even if Trump doesn’t try to remove Powell, the relationship with the White House could be tested in other ways. One could involve the Fed’s staffing. The action could start with Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, who are set to lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and expect to propose sweeping cuts in government spending to create a more efficient government. Some of those cuts, Musk has hinted, could involve the Fed. He said on X recently that the Fed is ""absurdly overstaffed."" The Federal Reserve Board in Washington and its 12 regional reserve banks across the US employed about 24,000 people last year. The vast majority — more than 86% — of staff work out of the reserve banks and branches located throughout the country. The Federal Reserve Board, located in Washington, D.C., employs about 3,000 staff members. But unlike most of the federal government, the Fed is not funded through the taxpayers or the congressional appropriations process. The central bank funds its own operations — primarily from the interest on government securities that it gets through open market operations. The Fed’s net operating expenses for 2024 are budgeted to be $7.1 billion, which amounts to roughly 0.1% of the federal government’s budget. The Fed’s revenue has often covered its expenses, allowing the Fed to send its excess earnings to the US Treasury. Between 2012 and 2021, the Fed sent nearly $1 trillion to the Treasury. Congresswoman Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, issued a statement saying that Musk is laying the groundwork to use the Fed as a scapegoat to ""deflect blame from the incoming administration’s disastrous economic policies."" ""It is no surprise then that his co-President has claimed the Fed is overstaffed when he actually wants to enact Project 2025’s outlandish plan to end the Fed, sending the U.S. back to a 19th century economy,"" Waters said. And Powell himself has suggested the Fed could be immune from the cutting block of DOGE, noting that the Fed is ""self-funded"" and has ""strong legal independence."" Policies from the incoming administration could create additional uncertainty for Fed officials and mix the calculus for the trajectory of rates next year. President-elect Trump recently announced he would impose an additional 10% tariff on imports from China and 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada. EY chief economist Gregory Daco forecast that steep tariff increases would lead to stagflation through lower growth and higher inflation while also triggering financial market turbulence. Daco estimated that the 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, along with 10% tariffs on China, would reduce US GDP by 1.5% in 2025 and raise inflation by 0.4%. Read more: What are tariffs, and how do they affect you? Not all Fed watchers expect inflation to get worse, however. Former St. Louis Fed president Jim Bullard, who served on the Fed during Trump’s first term in office, said he doesn’t see big inflationary impacts coming from tariffs because they could hurt growth. ""I think probably the detriment to the world economy would outweigh any price effects,"" he told Yahoo Finance. ""So I'm not really seeing the inflation argument here on tariffs."" When Trump slapped tariffs on China in 2018 and 2019 and threatened many other countries during his first term, Bullard added, the trade war created uncertainty globally, and that caused businesses to pull back on investment. Luke Tilley, chief economist for Wilmington Trust, agreed with Bullard and said he sees more pressure on economic growth than inflation. If large tariffs led to a lot of retaliation, he said he believes the US would head toward recession. The central bank would then cut rates 12 months later. ""The larger the tariffs are, and the more retaliation there is, the more likely we are to have a recession and that would actually mean lower inflation and lower rates over the long term,"" Tilley said. Powell said in December that there are still too many unknowns for the Fed to game out how tariffs could impact setting rates. However, he did say that some Fed officials have begun to factor in Trump’s proposed policies into their policy assumptions. ""We don’t know how big they’ll be, we don’t know their timing and their duration, we don’t know what goods will be tariffed, we don’t know what countries’ goods will be tariffed, we don’t know how that will play into prices,"" Powell said in December in New York.

ICA blames foreigners for surge in sham marriages Sham marriages have risen sharply in 2024, with 32 cases reported between January and September, compared to four cases within the same period in 2023. According to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA), the rise in sham marriages is due to the increasing number of foreigners wanting to extend their visit passes to continue staying and working here. Inspector Mark Chai, deputy officer-in-charge of ICA’s intelligence division, explained to The Straits Times that sham marriages in Singapore often involve a foreign woman paying a Singaporean man money to marry so they can stay or work here. ""The idea of such marriages is often spread through word of mouth. And to some Singaporean men, it can be seen as easy money,"" said Chai. Superintendent Goh Wee Kiat, a senior assistant director at ICA’s intelligence division, said most marriage of convenience cases were reported through public tip-offs. While couples can try to hide it, he pointed out that there are ""telltale signs that out officers are able to spot"". A marriage of convenience is illegal and those involved can be jailed for up to 10 years, fined up to $10,000, or both.

More than 12,000 gathered to watch the Professional Women's Hockey League's Boston Fleet and the Montréal Victoire battle in a neutral-site, regular-season matchup, with the Fleet getting the exciting 3-2 shootout win. The game took place a year, nearly to the day, that the PWHL’s inaugural season began. Now, in just its second year, the league is already looking to expand, and it’s looking to cities like Seattle. The PWHL rose from the ashes of previous women’s hockey leagues with an ambitious eye to the future. After a year of neutral branding, the league unveiled names and jerseys for the inaugural six teams in September, and is looking to expand with two more franchises in the coming years. Those expansion bids seem to be part of the basis for the Takeover Tour, which will see PWHL teams play in nine cities across the United States and Canada over the next few months. On Sunday, that tour kicked off in Seattle. Joy Adiletta, a fan in attendance at the game, believes that the Takeover Tour “absolutely” has expansion in mind. “If you look at the stadiums they’re going to,” she told me ahead of the game, “I think they’re definitely testing it out.” All of the cities — Seattle, Vancouver, Denver, Quebec City, Edmonton, Buffalo, Raleigh, Detroit and St. Louis — have passionate hockey and sports fanbases. Many have NHL franchises. The PWHL even chose to exclusively host the three Canadian teams (Montréal, the Toronto Sceptres and the Ottawa Charge) in the Canadian cities. Adiletta and her partner, Jo Narvaez-Grey, are Kraken season ticket holders and Seattle sports fans who were drawn to the PWHL during the league’s inaugural season. On Sunday, they were decked out in brand-new PWHL gear from the merchandise kiosks, where pregame lines wrapped around the queue and far into the hallways. “It looks like they’re trying to build it right, and I really want that to be successful,” Adiletta said of the new league. Part of that is the PWHL showcasing the incredible talent within the league. Narvaez-Grey was particularly excited to see Montréal's Marie-Philip Poulin, Canadian captain and women’s hockey legend, in action. “If the women’s game had the same kind of setup as the men’s game, she’d probably be up there with [Wayne] Gretzky, in my opinion,” Narvaez-Grey said. This Takeover Tour helps provide a bigger stage. Getting to play in an NHL-sized stadium is not a guaranteed experience in the PWHL — only two of the league’s teams share arenas with NHL teams, while the rest use lower-capacity stadiums. The stadiums on tour are higher-capacity than the league typically plays in; Climate Pledge has a capacity of 17,151 for hockey. The official attendance for Sunday’s game was 12,608 people, nearly twice the PWHL's average attendance in 2024: 5,844 throughout the 2024 calendar year. Seattle has never had a professional women’s hockey team, but Climate Pledge Arena has hosted women’s hockey before, holding a rivalry matchup between the United States and Canadian national teams. Stacy Hochhalter, a Montréal fan based in the Seattle area, was at that game, and showed up to Sunday’s game 30 minutes before the doors opened, wearing a Victoire sweatshirt. “I love seeing the support that the women get, not just in Seattle but everywhere,” Hochhalter said. “A couple years ago, when the USA was playing here, it was a great turnout. People love women’s hockey here, so I really hope we get a team.” On Sunday, Seattle did its best to welcome the PWHL. Kraken assistant coach Jessica Campbell — a former Team Canada forward who made history this season as the first female coach in the NHL — did the puck drop, walking out to roaring applause. Several Kraken players were also in attendance, and Seattle women’s sports icons Sue Bird and Megan Rapinoe also made an appearance. Incredible ovation for Jess Campbell, as she drops the ceremonial opening face-off. #SeaKraken pic.twitter.com/9PTbziHzJv — Sound Of Hockey (@sound_hockey) January 5, 2025 Everyone watches women's sports. 🤝Sue Bird and Megan Rapinoe are in the building 🗣 pic.twitter.com/P87ldlt0Q3 — PWHL (@thepwhlofficial) January 5, 2025 Victoire forward Laura Stacey, a veteran who played in the now-defunct CWHL, spoke after the game about the privilege of being able to come to places like Climate Pledge and how far they have come. “We’ve gone through plenty of years where we’ve played in buildings, the exact same product on the ice, but not many fans in the building,” Stacey said. “It’s a pretty big honor to be able to come to places like this, rinks like this, and have 12,000 fans cheering for two teams that don’t even belong to their own city. I think it’s amazing to see.” Thank you, Seattle 🫶 pic.twitter.com/uWOWTngMyo — PWHL (@thepwhlofficial) January 6, 2025 With just one game, Seattle fans are already dreaming of a potential expansion team, citing the city’s enthusiasm for women’s sports and the passionate Seattle Kraken fanbase that has emerged since the team’s first season in 2021. (One sign in the crowd pitched “Seattle Freeze” as a potential team name — a cheeky play on the area’s chilly reputation, hospitality-wise.) As with any neutral-site game, there was an interesting mix of jerseys in the crowd. There were Fleet and Victoire jerseys, other PWHL jerseys and Kraken jerseys, plus a general smattering of other NHL teams, Seattle teams and women’s sports merchandise. Some fans had jerseys and merchandise from the league’s inaugural season, with neutral branding. One such fan was Jayden Joseph, a 20-year-old who flew up from San Francisco to watch the game, as Seattle was the closest city on the tour. Joseph planned the trip soon after the tour was announced, wanting to see PWHL teams play live. “Honestly, I don’t even care who wins, I just want to see a great game,” Joseph said before the game, wearing a maroon Montréal jersey from last season, when the team was known simply as “PWHL Montréal.” Joseph’s wish was granted: After two first-period goals from Victoire forwards Laura Stacey and Abigail Boreen, Boston came back with a goal from Fleet forward Hannah Bilka in the second period and a game-tying goal from Susanna Tapani in the third. The game went to overtime and then to a thrilling shootout, with Boston scoring three of four goals and Montréal only getting one of four. The Fleet took the win as a result, grabbing two points, while the Victoire earned one for making it to overtime. Sunday’s game was a riveting example of what women’s hockey can be, highlighted by the hope that players and fans hold for the future of the sport. The PWHL’s players have taken their status as role models very seriously, trying to use their influence to grow the game and inspire the next generation. In Stacey’s view, the games on this tour are a mixture of playing their best and winning the game, but also “enjoying that moment, taking in that crowd out there, and inspiring as many people as we can.” Brandie Lueth attended the game as part of a big group from Seattle Red Hawks girls’ hockey, which her daughter Jordan is part of. Wearing a red “Hockey Mom” sweatshirt that matched her daughter’s club jersey, Lueth said that the girls were “very excited” to watch the game. Lueth and her family went to the open practice session on Saturday, when the Fleet and Victoire met fans and signed autographs. Jordan has been playing hockey for a year, but Lueth said that there were only enough players in the program for one team per age group. (Jordan’s favorite player is Fleet captain Hilary Knight, who captains the U.S. national team. Knight did not have the best game, but received a number of hearty cheers from the crowd.) “It’s great to see women’s hockey in the area … trying to get more girls into the sport and see that there’s a spot for them,” said Lueth. Much of what Sunday’s game, and the tour as a whole, represents is the growth of the league and the sport in general. Fleet coach Courtney Kessel pointed out after the game how fast the league has grown since it debuted in January 2024. “If you think about where we were one year from today, who would’ve thought that we could expand so soon,” Kessel said. “It’s an exciting time for our game, and I think you see the growth. We had an amazing audience here today, and hopefully moving forward we can continue to grow this.” Victoire coach Kori Cheverie said postgame that part of that growth will come with showcasing the league’s talent and “the product on the ice” in front of large audiences like Sunday’s. “These two teams, we battled hard tonight, and Boston battles hard every single time we play them, but you know that’s the type of hockey that you can expect from the PWHL,” Cheverie said. To that point, Stacey added simply: “Women’s hockey’s here, women’s hockey’s thriving, and it’s not going anywhere.”",5,[],2025-01-06 04:05:56,2025-01-09 00:30:53

He has sent one of his toughest generals to organise the fight back against Ukraine’s surprise Sunday morning counter-offensive. General Yunus-Bek Yevkurov, promoted in December 2024 by Putin and trusted to run Russia’s border defences and Africa mercenary projects, arrived in Kursk less than a couple of hours after Ukrainian tanks started rumbling towards Russian positions. By sending Gen Yevkurov to Kursk, Putin has shown his hand. Although it is still unclear how successful the Ukrainian counter-offensive will be, he is clearly worried. Repelling Ukraine’s August 2024 advance into Russia’s southern Kursk region has become a priority project for Putin before Donald Trump is inaugurated as US president on Jan 20 2025 and imposes a peace deal. Turning up to negotiations with Ukraine still holding on to Russian territory, even small parcels, will weaken Putin. Volodymyr Zelensky knows this. The Ukrainian president may have calculated that with his forces being pushed back along the main front line, applying pressure in Kursk is his best option. If his forces can push back Russian soldiers in Kursk and hold on to captured ground for another two or three weeks, Mr Zelensky may feel that he can strengthen his negotiating position. But the stakes are still much higher for Mr Zelensky. Sunday’s Kursk counter-offensive could be his final roll of the dice. Since the start of the war in February 2022, Mr Zelensky had staked his presidency on an unflinching determination to defeat Russia on the battlefield. His language has softened since the summer, when it became clear that Ukraine was too weak to defeat Russia militarily and Mr Trump won the US presidential election, but his instinct is still to fight rather than negotiate. Mr Zelensky’s problem is that this instinct now lies at odds with the exhausted Ukrainian population which now favours negotiating a peace deal with Russia. He will hope that his attack in Kursk will once again persuade his Western allies that Ukraine still has the stomach for a fight and is worth backing. As for Putin, Sunday’s action is probably more of an irritation, perhaps just a distraction, than a major headache. It is a personal affront for Ukraine to attack his forces inside Russia again, but he will cling to his core belief that with the weight of numbers, Russian forces will defeat Ukrainian troops eventually. The problem for Putin is “eventually”. His tactic of overwhelming Ukrainian positions with swarm infantry tactics relies on time. With the clock ticking down towards a second Trump presidency and potential peace negotiations, he may not have this luxury in the Kursk region.

Trump exists in our political sphere because he persuaded people to forget that simple fact. He somehow turned dunderheads like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and, of course, himself – public figures who routinely utter abject nonsense – into people who get taken seriously. Following the New Orleans terrorist attack on New Year’s Day, Trump ranted about immigration when the suspect killed in the attack was a U.S. citizen. That was stupid and unhelpful. For a president-elect and elected leaders who protect him, it should be deeply embarrassing. When Greene hypothesized that Jewish space lasers started California wildfires, that was not a mistake or an “oops” moment. It was stupid, and it should have been the embarrassing end of her political career. When Kennedy encourages people to drink bacteria-laden raw milk, he should be laughed out of the country. Instead, Trump has picked him to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which is utterly stupid and should be profoundly embarrassing for Trump. Opinion: What will happen in 2025? Trump will always be right – and more guaranteed predictions. Yet here we are, waiting for Trump to return to the White House and install harebrained MAGA acolytes in all positions of power, confidently and without shame. It’s that last bit that’s the problem: “without shame.” We all do dumb things. There have been plenty of times I’ve said or written something stupid, made a dumb factual error or mouthed off about something I didn’t fully understand. And it’ll happen again, to be sure. No matter the room, I’d never claim to be the smartest guy in it. The difference, though, is that in those dumb moments, when I’ve realized my own blunder, I’ve felt embarrassed. When I’ve had to correct a column or admit I got out over my skis on something, I’ve been ashamed of the mistake. Shame is what keeps us in check, or at least it should. It certainly used to. Trump, devoid of shame, has gone to great lengths to eviscerate that societal check. How else do you explain politicians supporting him – a convicted felon, an inveterate liar, a man found liable of sexual abuse – for a third time? The decision to put someone like Trump back in the most powerful position in America should be embarrassing. It wasn’t. Opinion: Trump picks Musk's money over 'forgotten' Americans of MAGA. Sorry, xenophobes! That’s enough to make people who dislike Trump, whether because of his politics or his personality, feel powerless. I get that. However, I’d argue the best way to reclaim power in the age of Trumpism is to stop tolerating stupidity. Before I go further on that, let’s be clear what I mean by “stupidity.” I’m not talking about any level of education. Heck, most of the people Trump surrounds himself with are highly educated but dumb as fence posts.

It’s the willingness to say something objectively false and refuse to admit you’re wrong. It’s the lack of curiosity that allows our leaders to accept bologna conspiracy theories over provable facts. Those, to me, are traits that should be embarrassing. But since Trump’s first presidential win, some people have been afraid to call out such traits. The argument is, essentially: “Well, he won people over, so we shouldn’t call him dumb lest we insult his voters, who we must do our best to understand.” That hasn’t worked out particularly well. If anything, proud ignorance has flourished. So now, as we await whatever fresh hell a new Trump administration will bring, it’s time to stop pandering to politicians who have embraced a reality disconnected from actual reality. When Trump blames an act of domestic terrorism by a former U.S. Army soldier on immigrants, we should loudly call that what it is: stupid. It's not a matter of differing opinions or ""agreeing to disagree."" It's, ""If you can't accept basic facts, you're a chucklehead who should be shunned."" Making people feel embarrassed for believing claptrap or speaking a bald-faced lie isn’t cruel. It’s corrective. We don’t coddle our kids when they spew nonsense or think the truth is irrelevant. We correct them. And we do that to avoid the kind of chaos Trump has brought and continues to bring. So I encourage you, as this year goes along, to make politicians who say stupid things feel uncomfortable. You may not think your voice matters, but the collective force of all our voices reminding people our society looks down on willful ignorance might matter. Besides, we tried the other way, and things only got worse. Comforting fools paves a path for more fools to follow. Do America a favor – mock stupidity at every turn.

The singer shares a nomination for Best Original Song – Motion Picture with Andrew Wyatt and Lykke Zachrisson for The Last Showgirl’s “Beautiful That Way.” At this year’s ceremony, Cyrus dressed on theme in a showy plunging Celine gown with waist cut-outs, accessorized with Celine shoes, Celine sunglasses, and De Beers jewelry. She wore her hair in an updo with blunt bangs, styled by Bob Recine, and paired the look with smoky eyeshadow and winged liner courtesy of James Kalliardos. When Cyrus first attended the Golden Globes in 2009, she was only 16 years old, with a Best Original Song nomination for “I Thought I Lost You” in the 2008 animated feature Bolt. She wore a white strapless Marchesa gown. Last month, Cyrus reflected on her second Golden Globes nomination on Instagram. She wrote, “It’s an honor to be nominated for Best Original Song alongside my friends and collaborators Andrew Wyatt and Lykke Li at the Golden Globes and Critics Choice Awards. Pamela [Anderson] is graciously sharing her moment with us. I am continuing to root for her, it’s so fun to watch her shine. Thank you Gia Coppola for inviting me to be a part of your gem The Last Showgirl.” Weeks later, the singer revealed on the platform that 2024 had been a particularly happy year for her. “It’s bittersweet saying goodbye to a year that has been so good to me, but I am looking forward to starting over again,” she wrote of ringing in 2025. “This is one of my favorite parts of not just the creative process but the way life has chosen to teach me. “In everything I do I like to go ALL the way. Give it ALL I’ve got. ALL for it to come to an end, move on and start anew.

She graced the red carpet in a stunning LaQuan Smith Mock Neck Column Gown. The dress, a true showstopper, featured a mock neck design that added a touch of elegance. Its most striking element was the intricate crystal embellishments that adorned the gown from top to bottom, shimmering under the lights.

The shoes featured a minimalist design, with a single, thin strap gracefully extending across the open toes. Akin to the strappy sandal, barely there heels are a red carpet favorite. Strappy sandals, originating in the early 1900s, have been popular for their versatility and come in many styles.  Many brands, including Chanel and Stuart Weitzman, offer them in their footwear collections.

On the red carpet, she frequently graces events in designs by renowned fashion houses such as Dior, Balmain, and Calvin Klein. Her footwear often features the iconic red soles of Christian Louboutin. However, Paris’s personal style is a unique blend that transcends high-fashion labels. She effortlessly combines elements of grunge with vintage influences from the 1970s and 1980s. This eclectic mix is evident in her preference for loose-fitting silhouettes, flowing fabrics, and bohemian-inspired pieces.

Advocates say the Social Security Fairness Act rights a decades-old disparity, though it will also put strain on Social Security Trust Funds, which face a looming insolvency crisis.  The bill rescinds two provisions —",FATIMA HUSSEIN,2025-01-05T23:28:36.000Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden on Sunday signed into law a measure that boosts Social Security payments for current and former public employees, affecting nearly 3 million people who receive pensions from their time as teachers, firefighters, police officers and in other public service jobs. Advocates say the Social Security Fairness Act rights a decades-old disparity, though it will also put strain on Social Security Trust Funds, which face a looming insolvency crisis. The bill rescinds two provisions — the Windfall Elimination Provision and the Government Pension Offset — that limit Social Security benefits for recipients if they get retirement payments from other sources, including public retirement programs from a state or local government. “The bill I'm signing today is about a simple proposition: Americans who have worked hard all their life to earn an honest living should be able to retire with economic security and dignity — that's the entire purpose of the Social Security system,” Biden said during a signing ceremony in the White House East Room. “This is a big deal,” he said. Biden was joined by labor leaders, retirement advocates, and Democratic and Republican lawmakers including the legislation's primary sponsors, Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins and exiting Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, who received a standing ovation from ceremony attendees. The Congressional Research Service estimated that in December 2023, there were 745,679 people, about 1% of all Social Security beneficiaries, who had their benefits reduced by the Government Pension Offset. About 2.1 million people, or about 3% of all beneficiaries, were affected by the Windfall Elimination Provision. The Congressional Budget Office estimated in September that eliminating the Windfall Elimination Provision would boost monthly payments to the affected beneficiaries by an average of $360 by December 2025. Ending the Government Pension Offset would increase monthly benefits in December 2025 by an average of $700 for 380,000 recipients getting benefits based on living spouses, according to the CBO. The increase would be an average of $1,190 for 390,000 or surviving spouses getting a widow or widower benefit. Those amounts would increase over time with Social Security’s regular cost-of-living adjustments. The change is to payments from January 2024 and beyond, meaning the Social Security Administration would owe back-dated payments. The measure as passed by Congress says the Social Security commissioner ""shall adjust primary insurance amounts to the extent necessary to take into account” changes in the law. It's not immediately clear how this will happen or whether people affected will have to take any action. Edward Kelly, president of the International Association of Fire Fighters, said firefighters across the country are “excited to see the change — we've righted a 40-year wrong.” Kelly said the policy was “far more egregious for surviving spouses of firefighters who paid their own quotas into Social Security but were victimized by the government pension system.” The IAFF has roughly 320,000 members, which does not include hundreds of thousands of retirees who will benefit from the change. “Now firefighters who get paid very little can now afford to actually retire,"" Kelly said. Brown, who as an Ohio senator pushed for the proposal for years, lost his reelection bid in November. Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees labor union, thanked Brown for his advocacy. “Over two million public service workers will finally be able to access the Social Security benefits they spent their careers paying into,"" Saunders said in a statement. ""Many will finally be able to enjoy retirement after a lifetime of service.” National Education Association President Becky Pringle said the law is “a historic victory that will improve the lives of educators, first responders, postal workers and others who dedicate their lives to public service in their communities.” And while some Republicans such as Collins supported the legislation, others, including Sens. John Thune of South Dakota, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, voted against it. “We caved to the pressure of the moment instead of doing this on a sustainable basis,” Tillis told The Associated Press last month. Still, Republican supporters of the bill said there was a rare opportunity to address what they described as an unfair section of federal law that hurts public service retirees. The future of Social Security has become a top political issue and was a major point of contention in the 2024 election. About 72.5 million people, including retirees, disabled people and children, receive Social Security benefits. The policy changes from the new law will heap more administrative work on the Social Security Administration, which is already at its lowest staffing level in decades. The agency, currently under a hiring freeze, has a staff of about 56,645 — the lowest level in over 50 years even as it serves more people than ever. The annual Social Security and Medicare trustees report released last May said the program’s trust fund will be unable to pay full benefits beginning in 2035. The new law will hasten the program’s insolvency date by about half a year. Along with ratifying the Social Security Fairness Act, earlier in his presidency Biden signed the Butch Lewis Act into law, which saved the retirement pensions of two million union workers. ___ Associated Press writer Stephen Groves contributed to this report.",11.5k,[],2025-01-06 04:05:56,2025-01-06 19:53:40

This year, the couple returned to the ceremony. While Chalamet was photographed solo on the red carpet, Jenner joined him inside the ceremony again. She appeared next to him in a backless silver look. She also posed with Elle Fanning and Monica Barbaro at his table: This is the couple’s first big date night in months. The star recently told ELLE that she doesn’t talk about her love life publicly: “I think it’s important to keep things to yourself. It’s hard for me to make a decision by myself sometimes, so the opinion of the whole world…it can be tough.” Chalamet is nominated for Best Performance by a Male Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama for his work in the Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown. Last year, he and Jenner generated quite a few headlines at the ceremony, after fans speculated that Jenner kept Selena Gomez, Chalamet’s former A Rainy Day in New York co-star, from getting a photo with him. One day later, Chalamet clarified to TMZ that wasn’t the case at all. Gomez and Jenner don’t have any “beef,” he said. “We’re all good,” he added of the three stars’ relationship. The actor just celebrated the holidays with Jenner, although their celebration was a little ahead of December 25. On December 30, a source revealed to People that “they had an early Christmas celebration together before Kylie spent Christmas Day with her family. It took Kylie a long time to introduce him to her kids [Stormi and Aire]. He’s part of the family now though. Her kids know him as a ‘friend.’” Over a year into dating, Jenner and Chalamet’s relationship “is great and very easy,” the insider continued. “He’s super supportive of her priorities, and he works around her schedule a lot.

The S&P 500 Transportation Index had a tough 2024, slipping 0.5% while the overall S&P 500 soared 23%. But Gates seems to see opportunity in the midst of it all. According to market analysts, his two picks – Paccar and FedEx – reflect a belief that the sector is poised for a turnaround, especially if the economy improves in 2025. These strategic buys are worth a closer look. Paccar (NASDAQ:PCAR) might not ring a bell, but it’s heavy in heavy-duty trucks. The company's Peterbilt and Kenworth brands command 14.9% and 14.7% of the U.S. Class 8 truck market, second only to Freightliner's dominant 36.5% share, as reported by ATD. See Also: The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market. These massive trucks, weighing over 33,000 pounds, are critical to the economy and Paccar's performance reflects that. Paccar had a strong start to 2024, with a quarterly revenue of $8.74 billion in the first quarter. But as truckload demand dipped, the momentum faded. Still, signs of a recovery are emerging. Kenny Vieth, president of ACT Research, told Transport Topics, ""We're in the early stages of building 2025 backlogs and November orders were up 21% from October."" Gates scooped up one million Paccar shares at around $100 each, a $100 million investment in a company he believes has long-term promise. Trending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today. Then there's FedEx (NYSE:FDX), a logistics powerhouse navigating turbulence. Its third-quarter report fell short of expectations and the company revised its full-year forecast downward, unsettling investors. But Gates saw an opportunity, snapping up another one million shares at an average of $273 each. FedEx has been shaking things up internally. The company announced plans to spin off its less-than-truckload freight division, FedEx Freight, into a stand-alone business. According to Bloomberg, this division pulled in $9.4 billion in 2023 and could become a growth driver as FedEx sharpens its focus on core operations. The move is part of its broader DRIVE initiative, which aims to make the company more efficient and flexible. Analysts believe this will streamline FedEx's operations and position it for growth if the economy rebounds.

Evans went into the game needing five receptions and 85 yards to reach that bonus and tie Jerry Rice for an 11th straight 1,000-yard season. Yet, when the Bucs forced a late-game turnover on downs to virtually end the game, it appeared that Evans was going to come up five yards short of that pay day. Baker Mayfield had other ideas. In a somewhat risky move during a one-score game, the Bucs lined up for an offensive play instead of kneeling out the clock. The sole purpose was to get Evans his five yards and that bonus, which was exactly what happened. Just look at the reaction from the Bucs bench -- it was so good.

But they’re also family executives, doing more of the thinking ahead and assigning that are part of all those chores – bad news for their mental health.","Darby Saxbe, USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and Lizzie Aviv, University of Southern California",2025-01-05T16:36:24.000Z,"When you think about housework, you likely think of actions: scrubbing the dishes, running errands, chopping vegetables for dinner. And it’s not news to say that mothers often shoulder the burden for most of those activities. But there’s an invisible dimension of household labor that unfolds behind the scenes: the cognitive effort that goes into anticipating needs, planning, organizing and delegating household tasks. In other words, someone has to remember to replace the dish soap and select which vegetables to chop. Our new research found that this cognitive dimension of housework, often called the “mental load,” is divided even more unevenly within couples than the physical dimension – and it seems to take a particular mental health toll on women. According to the study we published in the Archives of Women’s Mental Health, mothers who take on a more disproportionate share of cognitive household labor report higher levels of depression, stress, relationship dissatisfaction and burnout. We asked 322 mothers of young children about who in their family is responsible for 30 common household tasks. We collaborated with the creators of the Fair Play system – a book and card game designed to better quantify the division of labor within households – to divide each task into two dimensions: cognitive (anticipating, planning, delegating and thinking about household tasks) and physical (the hands-on execution of household tasks). We then examined how these tasks are shared between partners. We found a striking gender disparity: Mothers not only performed more physical housework but also carried a significantly greater share of cognitive labor compared with their partners. On average, mothers reported being responsible for about 73% of all cognitive household labor compared with their partners’ 27%, and 64% of all physical household labor compared with their partners’ 36%. Indeed, for every single task we examined, the gender difference was larger for the cognitive dimension than the physical execution dimension. There was only one task in which fathers did more planning and execution: taking out the garbage. Fathers also carried out more home maintenance tasks, but mothers did more of the related planning. Interestingly, while an unequal division of physical tasks was linked to worse couple relationship quality, it was the cognitive labor that had a more profound impact on women’s psychological well-being. An unequal division of household labor is a key driver of global gender inequity, suppressing women’s full participation in the paid workforce and significantly affecting women’s health and well-being. Our study is one of the first to investigate the cognitive dimension of household labor and its effects on maternal mental health. Cognitive labor may be particularly taxing for women because it often runs behind the scenes and goes unacknowledged or unappreciated by others. It also pulls mental energy away from other priorities. Additional studies indicate that women experience more negative effects from child care and housework compared with men, such as higher depression rates, partly due to the heavier cognitive load they carry. Our study was limited by its reliance on self-reported household labor and by the fact that we were able to collect data only from mothers in cohabiting, heterosexual couple relationships. Future studies can survey both partners and directly observe what chores couples do at home. They can also look at different kinds of relationship configurations, including gay and lesbian couples. We also don’t know much about the long-term effects of the division of cognitive labor on women’s mental health and cognitive functioning. The unfair division of housework is a frequent source of stress in relationships and often cited by women as a reason for divorce. The cognitive load may be an underappreciated aspect of the domestic workload that warrants more attention from couples therapists, mental health counselors and premarital relationship educators.

https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/links-aging-disease-growing-body-163614027.html,What links aging and disease? A growing body of research says it’s a faulty metabolism,,Health,The Conversation,4 min read,"Targeting the key players that help your body regulate metabolism could reverse disease progression, including cognitive decline related to Alzheimer’s disease.","Melanie R. McReynolds, Penn State",2025-01-05T16:36:14.000Z,"Aging is a biological process that no one can avoid. Ideally, growing old should be a time to relax and enjoy the fruits of your labor. Aging also has a darker side, however, often linked to disease. Every second, your cells perform billions of biochemical reactions that fuel essential functions for life, forming a highly interconnected metabolic network. This network enables cells to grow, proliferate and repair themselves, and its disruption can drive the aging process. But does aging cause metabolic decline, or does metabolic disruption accelerate aging? Or both? To address this chicken-or-egg question, you first need to understand how metabolic processes break down during aging and disease. I am a scientist and researcher, and my lab focuses on exploring the complex relationship between metabolism, stress and aging. Ultimately, we hope this work will provide strategies to promote healthier aging and more vibrant lives. Aging is the most significant risk factor for many of society’s most common diseases, including diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative disorders. A key factor behind the onset of these health issues is the disruption of cellular and metabolic homeostasis, or balance. Disrupting homeostasis destabilizes the body’s internal environment, leading to imbalances that can trigger a cascade of health issues, including metabolic disorders, chronic diseases and impaired cellular functions that contribute to aging and other serious conditions. Disrupted metabolism is linked to many hallmarks of aging cells, such as telomere shortening, which is damage to the protective ends of chromosomes, and genomic instability, the tendency to form genetic mutations. A dysfunctional metabolism is also linked to poorly functioning mitochondria; cellular senescence, or when cells stop dividing; imbalances in gut microbes; and cells’ reduced ability to detect and respond to different nutrients. Neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, are prime examples of age-related conditions with a strong link between dysregulated metabolism and functional decline. For example, my research team previously discovered that in aging mice, the ability of bone marrow cells to produce, store and use energy is suppressed due to increased activity from a protein that modulates inflammation. This energy-deficient state leads to an increase in inflammation that’s worsened by these aging cells’ reliance on glucose as their main fuel source. Experimentally inhibiting this protein in the bone marrow cells of aging mice, however, revitalizes the cells’ ability to produce energy, reduces inflammation and improves plasticity of an area of the brain involved in memory. This finding suggests that some cognitive aging could be reversed by reprogramming the glucose metabolism of bone marrow cells to restore immune functions. In our newly published research, my team and I discovered a new connection between disrupted glucose metabolism and neurodegenerative disease. This led us to identify a drug originally designed for cancer that could potentially be used to treat Alzheimer’s. We focused on an enzyme called IDO1 that plays a critical role in the first step of breaking down amino acid tryptophan. This pathway produces a key compound called kynurenine, which fuels additional energy pathways and inflammatory responses. However, excessive kynurenine can have detrimental effects, including increasing the risk of developing Alzheimer’s. We found that inhibiting IDO1 can recover memory and brain function in a range of preclinical models, including in cell cultures and mice. To understand why, we looked at the metabolism of brain cells. The brain is one of the most glucose-dependent tissues in the body. An inability to properly use glucose to fuel critical brain processes can lead to metabolic and cognitive decline. High levels of IDO1 reduce glucose metabolism by producing excess kynurenine. So IDO1 inhibitors – originally designed to treat cancers such as melanoma, leukemia and breast cancer – could be repurposed to reduce kynurenine and improve brain function. Using a range of lab models, including mice and cells from Alzheimer’s patients, we also found that IDO1 inhibitors can restore glucose metabolism in brain cells. Furthermore, we were able to restore glucose metabolism in mice with both amyloid and tau accumulation – abnormal proteins involved in many neurodegenerative disorders – by blocking IDO1. We believe repurposing these inhibitors could be beneficial across various neurodegenerative disorders. The effects of neurological disorders and metabolic decline weigh heavily on individuals, families and the economy. While many scientists have focused on targeting the downstream effects of these diseases, such as managing symptoms and slowing progression, treating these diseases earlier can improve cognition with aging. Our findings suggest that targeting metabolism has the potential to not only slow neurological decline but also to reverse the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and dementia. Discovering new insights at the intersection of stress, metabolism and aging can pave the way for healthier aging. More research can improve our understanding of how metabolism affects stress responses and cellular balance throughout life.

https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/got-unaffordable-incorrect-medical-bill-151041867.html,Got an unaffordable or incorrect medical bill? Calling your hospital billing office will usually get you a discount,,US,The Conversation,5 min read,"Researchers found that nearly 74% of patients who reached out about a billing mistake received bill corrections. For those who negotiated their bills, nearly 62% saw a price drop.","Erin Duffy, University of Southern California",2025-01-05T15:10:41.000Z,"What do you do when you disagree with or can’t afford a medical bill? Many Americans struggle to pay medical bills, avoid care because of cost worries or forgo other needs due to health care cost burdens. It can be hard to understand what you’re being charged for on a medical bill. I’m a health policy and economics researcher who studies insurance and out-of-pocket health care expenses, and even I sit at my kitchen table trying to wrap my head around bills and explanations of benefits. In my newly published research, I surveyed a nationally representative sample of 1,135 American adults – a subset of participants from the University of Southern California’s Understanding America Study – to find out how they handle troubling medical bills. I learned that advocating for yourself can pay off when it comes to medical bills, and you may be missing out on financial relief when you don’t pick up the phone. My team and I found that 1 in 5 patients had received a health care bill in the prior year that they disagreed with or couldn’t afford. Nearly 35% of the bills came from doctor’s offices, nearly 20% from emergency rooms or urgent care and over 15% from hospitals. Other sources of bills included labs, imaging centers and dental offices. A little over 61% of respondents contacted the billing office about a troubling bill, but 2 in 5 did not. Why not? About 86% of patients said they did not think it would make a difference. But reaching out got results. Nearly 76% of patients who reached out got financial relief for an unaffordable bill. Nearly 74% who spoke up about a potential billing mistake received bill corrections. For those who negotiated their bills, nearly 62% saw a price drop. Additionally, 18% of patients who reached out got a better understanding of their bill, 16% set up payment plans and a little over 7% got the bill canceled altogether. Nearly 22% said their issue was unresolved, and 24% reported no change. The majority of people who reached out about their medical bills reported that it took less than one hour to handle their issue. We found that people with a more extroverted and less agreeable personality – based on the Big Five Personality Test – were more likely to reach out about a medical bill. People without a college degree, with lower financial literacy or with no health insurance were less likely to reach out to a billing office. Differences in who does and doesn’t call about a medical bill may be exacerbating inequalities in how much people end up paying for health care and who has medical debt. Many Americans are in health plans with high out-of-pocket cost sharing, including high-deductible plans. This so-called consumer-directed health care paradigm is intended to motivate consumers to be more cost-conscious when seeking care and navigating their bills. But by design, it puts the burden on patients to deal with billing issues. Another recent study my team and I conducted found that 87% of U.S. hospitals offer their own payment plans, but only 22% of these put plan details on their websites. You have to call for more information. In another recent study, my team called hospitals as “secret shoppers” planning an elective knee surgery. We sought information critical to assessing affordability: financial assistance, payment plans and payment timing options. While the information was often available, it was hard to access. We couldn’t reach a representative with information at about 18% of hospitals, even after calling on three different days. We were typically directed to three different offices to get all the information we wanted. Policymakers have made strides in price transparency in recent years. For example, hospitals are required to post prices for their products and services. Practices and policies that further reduce the administrative burden of accessing aid and navigating troubling bills. Patients who make the call are benefiting when it comes to medical bills. A colleague who knew I was working on this study asked me for advice about a $425 bill her household had received for a lab test at an urgent care center. The bill seemed inflated and unfair, forcing an unexpected stretch to her budget. I told her it was worth a call to the billing office to express her feelings about the bill and see whether any adjustments could be made to the amount owed or the timing of payment. It was worth the call. The billing office representative offered three options on the spot: a.) a payment plan, b.) a prompt payment of $126 paid immediately over the phone to settle the account, or c.) financial assistance if eligible based on income. My colleague chose option b and paid less than one-third of the original bill amount. The next time you get a medical bill that troubles you, pick up the phone or ask a disagreeable extrovert to make the call for you.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/lifestyle/nutritional-supplements-vitamins-more-popular-130000030.html,Nutritional supplements and vitamins are more popular than ever. Do they work?,,Health,NBC News,6 min read,"Dietary supplements — vitamins, minerals, botanicals and probiotics — are more popular than ever. Do they make a difference? Research is mixed.",Kaitlin Sullivan,2025-01-05T23:24:34.000Z,"Dietary supplements — vitamins, minerals, botanicals and probiotics — are more popular than ever. More than three-quarters of Americans take at least one, according to the Food and Drug Administration. Are any of them worth it? The research is mixed. Some vitamins, including multivitamins, have been shown to be beneficial in large, randomized clinical trials. Others have been shown to potentially cause harm. Many lie somewhere in between. As many as 100,000 different supplement products are sold in stores and online in the U.S., the FDA estimates. They range from multivitamins to herbs to concoctions that promise weight loss, including some that may be toxic or falsely claim to improve brain function. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for health and human services secretary, told podcaster Lex Fridman in 2023 that he takes “a ton of vitamins and nutrients,” which he said he couldn’t list because he “couldn’t remember them all.” In an October post on X, Kennedy accused the FDA of “aggressive suppression” of vitamins and nutraceuticals, among other things. In fact, the FDA has limited oversight over supplements after they’re on the market. In a published study from 2018, researchers with the California Department of Public Health raised concerns about products that contain unapproved and potentially unsafe ingredients. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 put dietary supplements in the same category as food under the FDA. This framework means the agency regulates dietary supplements as food products rather than pharmaceuticals. As a result, overseeing the products’ safety and efficacy is largely left up to the companies that sell them. “The FDA does not approve dietary supplements or their product labeling before they are sold to the public,” Dr. Cara Welch, director of the FDA’s Office of Dietary Supplement Programs in the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said in an interview on the agency’s website. “In fact, most products can be lawfully brought to the market without FDA even knowing.” If a company wants to sell a dietary supplement that contains an ingredient that i ’ot already present in food sold in the U.S., the company must submit a “new dietary ingredient” notification to the FDA, including a “history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that the dietary ingredient, when used under the conditions recommended or suggested in the labeling of the dietary supplement, will reasonably be expected to be safe.” The FDA reviews the notifications for safety issues but doesn’t approve or reject the supplement based on the efficacy of the ingredient. “Only a tiny fraction of the dietary supplements on the market have been rigorously tested for efficacy or safety,” said Dr. JoAnn Manson, chief of the division of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. Companies can also use a loophole called generally recognized as safe, or GRAS. This designation allows substances deemed as safe according either to research or to the fact that they are already used in food to be used in new products. No notification to the FDA is required. “Companies can just declare something as GRAS and then add it to supplements, and the FDA will never know about it unless there is a major problem,” said Jensen Jose, regulatory counsel at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. Many of the vitamins and minerals on the market are generally safe, if not always effective, and the agency does have the authority to request a recall if a product causes adverse side effects once consumers start using it or if the company is caught making misleading claims about a supplement. Some companies also voluntarily self-regulate. “What we do in self-regulation is above and beyond what is required in federal regulation,” said Steve Mister, president and CEO of the Council for Responsible Nutrition, a trade association and lobbying group that represents businesses that manufacture supplements. “There is a collective mindset that the industry needs to behave in responsible ways.” When it comes to research, understanding the effects supplements have on human health is difficult, time-consuming and costly, said Dr. David Seres, director of medical nutrition at the Columbia University Medical Center’s Institute of Human Nutrition. “The majority of the research that one hears about is observational, where two things are correlated but the cause-and-effect relationship cannot be established based on that research,” Seres said. “The majority of nutrition research tends to be these kinds of studies.” “There are clearly supplements with established benefits,” said Christopher Gardner, a professor of nutrition at Stanford University. “There are also many supplements that are likely not beneficial, but also not harmful.” Manson, who led the COSMOS-Mind clinical trial on multivitamins, said people should be cautious about vitamins that contain “mega doses.” “You have to look at the level and see what it says in terms of percentage of daily intake. Often it will say 400% or 500%, well above the daily intake value,” she said. Such high doses can be dangerous or a waste of money. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent panel of medical experts who make care recommendations regarding preventive and primary care, just drafted a new recommendation that advises against taking vitamin D to prevent falls and fractures among older people, based on evidence that shows it isn’t beneficial — unless someone has a diagnosed deficiency. There is some evidence that a daily multivitamin can protect against memory loss; however, numerous studies have failed to show that supplements have any miraculous effects on health. A diet like the Mediterranean diet, which is full of plants, vegetables and fatty fish, can lower risks of dementia or heart disease, but supplements usually don’t offer the same benefits, research has found. “In general, we should be able to get all the nutrients we need from foods, but the reality is many people do not always have access to a reasonable variety of healthy foods,” Gardner said, adding that people who don’t have access to a variety of nutritious foods may benefit from some supplements. For everyone else, more doesn’t mean better. “Most Americans meet all of their vitamin, mineral and nutritional needs. If intake is already adequate, it is rare when more would help,” he added. There isn’t one answer for why people take supplements that may provide little to no benefit, but it may be due to a strong desire to control their health, said Seres. “The hint of a benefit is a strong temptation when it is assumed that it can’t possibly be harmful and the airwaves are filled with ‘supports XYZ health,’” he said.

Police claim the evidence points to her husband James — alleging he purchased potassium cyanide and arsenic and laced her protein shakes with poison.,Natalie Morales,2025-01-05T07:09:15.000Z,"This story was originally posted on March 23. It was updated on Jan. 4, 2025. In Aurora, Colorado, James Craig was a well-known dentist. He and his wife Angela Craig were raising six children. On March 6, 2023, Angela Craig reported feeling sick and her husband took her to a hospital. There would be two hectic weeks and three hospital visits. On March 15, Angela Craig was put on life support; three days later, she was dead. Within hours, James Craig would be charged with first-degree murder. He has pleaded not guilty. Angela Craig's autopsy revealed she had been poisoned. And police claim the evidence points to her husband —  alleging he searched online videos about poison and then purchased potassium cyanide and arsenic. Podcaster Steffan Tubbs, who covered the case, says police allege in the arrest warrant that James Craig had made a Google search for ""How many grams of pure arsenic will kill a human?"" Authorities believe he went further, lacing his wife's drinks with poison. ""He administered, allegedly the poison via her protein shakes,"" said Tubbs. Skye Lazaro, an attorney familiar with cases involving poison, tells ""48 Hours"" contributor Natalie Morales that James Craig's defense might argue that police rushed to arrest him. ""It's essentially a three-day investigation,"" she said of the time it took police to charge him with his wife's murder. James Craig's defense has said he has a history of depression and had sought counseling in the past. Lazaro says they might argue he bought poison not to use on Angela Craig — but on himself. As for those allegedly poisoned protein shakes, Lazaro says that from what she's seen of the evidence made public so far, ""The state hasn't presented you any evidence that the poison was actually in the drink,"" she said. ANGELA CRAIG TEXTS HER HUSBAND ""I FEEL DRUGGED"" On March 18, 2023, in the Denver suburb of Aurora, Angela Craig died. Just days later, former radio personality Steffan Tubbs began his podcast about the sensational case and the unimaginable news. STEFFAN TUBBS (""Arsenic, DDS"" podcast): I want to personally send our condolences to the friends and family of Angela Craig, just 43 years old. She passed away, declared brain dead … And not lost on me … is the fact that this family has been temporarily … destroyed. James Craig had been almost immediately charged with the first-degree murder of his wife Angela. He has pleaded not guilty. The story of the dentist, his wife and the allegedly poisoned shakes would be told around the world. Steffan Tubbs: Come on. A dentist. Allegedly ordering potassium cyanide and arsenic. Really? But it was all as painfully real as a dentist's drill. Chelsea Otoya: Dr. Craig and Angela Craig were just like two peas in a pod. Chelsea Otoya: The two of them in the office was cute cause they would play pranks on each other all day long. Chelsea Otoya got to know James and Angela Craig when she worked for Dr. Craig at Summerbrook Dental. Chelsea Otoya: They seemed like the perfect couple. Until, according to Colorado police, James took his shot at the perfect crime. CBS NEWS STREAMING NETWORK: Investigators say he researched poisons in the days leading up to his wife's death. The idea that the dentist stood accused of murdering Angela, his wife of 23 years, seemed incomprehensible because the Craigs seemed so close. Chelsea Otoya: It just was heartbreaking for everyone, and I felt bad. Steffan Tubbs (driving): Coming up on our left, the former home of Summerbrook Dental. For Tubbs, the office building once home to Summerbrook, has become a tragic touchstone. Steffan Tubbs (driving): The last time that I had eye contact with Dr. Jim Craig, he gave me a root canal. Steffan Tubbs: I thought he was a great guy. I got incredibly competent friendly care. … He was a family man. We talked about his family, his kids … I — I met his wife. Angela Craig was the heart and soul of that family — mother to their six children and a hands-on partner in what seemed like a thriving business. Steffan Tubbs: She was not somebody just sit there and stay quiet. She was engaged in the dental practice. … She was somebody who was talking about ideas, and their marketing, their message. Tubbs helped refine that message, working on some of Summerbrook's advertising. He witnessed how those two peas in a pod worked side by side, with Angela pitching in as one of Jim's office managers. Steffan Tubbs: I thought it was kind of cool. You know, you've got a husband and wife, huge family. I thought it was — it was great to see a small Colorado business operated by, you know, husband and wife. Tubbs' podcast would delve into the disturbing details of Angela's medical journey: how and why she was allegedly murdered. That account from police is contained in a 52-page arrest warrant. Steffan Tubbs: In nearly 34 years of being a newsman, the most unbelievable and seemingly thorough arrest affidavit I have ever read. The warrant alleges that ""James has shown the planning and intent to end his wife's life by searching for ways to kill someone undetected."" Steffan Tubbs: This was not the James Craig that I knew. The James Craig Aurora knew was on display that March 6, 2023, the day Angela's odyssey began. James was at Summerbrook Dental when Angela texted from home: ""My eyes don't want to focus."" She texted ""I feel drugged."" James Craig headed right home. He picked up Angela and drove to the ER at Parker Adventist Hospital. She reported feeling dizzy and weak. Doctors fast went to work. Natalie Morales: She ends up going into the hospital, first time was March 6th, is that correct? George Brauchler: That's right. March 6th was her first time into the hospital. At the time, George Brauchler was another force in Colorado talk radio. He is also the former elected district attorney for Arapahoe County, where Angela Craig lived and would die, rattling this community. George Brauchler: This is a huge story. Like Tubbs, Brauchler has immersed himself in the details of Angela's final days—a desperate two-week ordeal. But on that March 6, as the hours passed in the ER, there were lots of questions, but few answers. George Brauchler: They really didn't have a good answer for what she was going through and … they end up releasing her and sending her home. Home — where Angela Craig appeared to think she was safe in her marriage. At least that's how she sounded in messages the couple sent each other, with Angela now home, recuperating from her ER visit. George Brauchler: There were texts … that would suggest a very supportive loving relationship. James Craig texts, ""I love you. It was so nice hanging out with you and just watching a show and snuggling."" Angela Craig texts James: ""Hi Baby! I love your face."" Back home, the busy couple picked up the daily routine that sustained them. George Brauchler: Jim and Angela apparently worked out in the morning. They worked out together. And one of the things that Jim did for his wife was to prepare her a protein shake … It was an absolute routine. George Brauchler: This was just part of the normal day. James Craig texts: ""I'll need to ask what you're hungry for and bring it to you. I'm kinda feeling just a smoothie or something."" ""I'm not feeling anything."" Angela Craig replies. ""Don't bring anything, I'll eat something here."" Within 24 hours, Angela Craig's symptoms came back fast and strong. She headed back to Parker Adventist. This time she would be admitted. Steffan Tubbs: The doctors and nurses are trying. They're conducting tests. … They just cannot figure out what is ailing this relatively normal and healthy 43-year-old woman. George Brauchler: All the steps that the doctors and medical staff had taken seemed to not be working. … it was a real mystery. UNRAVELING A MEDICAL MYSTERY Steffan Tubbs: There was nothing that would be even remotely a red flag, or this is a rocky, troubled marriage. None of that at all. With Angela Craig still terribly sick, in March 2023 she was back at Parker Adventist a second time, now as an admitted patient. According to the warrant during her stay, Angela Craig texted her husband James Craig to say, ""Now I'm hungry"" and he texted back later that was bringing food, writing ""Ok I gotchu."" George Brauchler: The loving husband who wants to see his wife remain healthy. That arrest warrant contains numerous texts detailing how as Angela Craig was hospitalized, James Craig went back and forth from their home to her bedside to Summerbrook — a husband seemingly supporting his wife and caring for their kids. Steffan Tubbs: He's continuing to go to work, and I don't begrudge him for that. He's got a family of six kids. And the warrant would show that apparent trust that Angela Craig placed in James, how she reached out to him to share her symptoms, texting, ""I'm cold, super tired, weak, shaky and dizzy"" And James Craig sent compassionate texts to Angela Craig: ""I love you and miss you and I'm so worried. I wish you were healthy enough to come home tonight and snuggle me."" Steffan Tubbs: Angela Craig was so sick. It seemed that all her symptoms had returned. Steffan Tubbs: She had horrible headaches. Horrible nausea … She was dizzy. … And doctors were at a loss. George Brauchler: Struggling to figure out what in the hell is causing this. What is making her sick? Steffan Tubbs: And they just could not get an answer. As Angela Craig stayed in the hospital without a diagnosis, James Craig was in touch with his friends Michelle and Ryan Redfearn.. Ryan Redfearn, a fellow dentist, had recently become business partners with James Craig, he would later tell police. George Brauchler: Ryan Redfearn went to dental school with Jim Craig all those 20-plus years ago. He'd known him all that time. … He was a close confidant. And with Angela Craig so sick, according to the warrant, James Craig also texted with Ryan's wife, Michelle Redfearn, trained as a nurse. Natalie Morales: What were they texting about? George Brauchler: The texts were really the kinds of things you would exchange with someone who's another medical professional. I mean, he was talking about blood pressure. He was talking about concerns the doctors had expressed about symptomology … that should have resolved by now. But one of James Craig's texts, in retrospect, seemed odd, as it appeared he was making light of Angela's mysterious illness. Steffan Tubbs: Jim Craig texts Michelle Redfearn, quote, ""If it wasn't my wife, this would be kind of a fun puzzle to try to work out, exclamation point."" Who says that? Still, a bad joke in times of crisis isn't unusual, says  former DA  Brauchler. George Brauchler: Everybody reacts to trauma differently. And James Craig seemed worried. It had been four hectic days since Angela was admitted. Police say Jim told others he was sleeping on a stool next to Angela that night when her vital signs crashed. Doctors responded through the night. Steffan Tubbs: I have thought about every agonizing minute that Angela Craig was in. But over the next day Angela Craig seemed to stabilize. And on March 14,  still with no answers as to why she was sick, Angela was released from Parker Adventist. Once again, Angela Craig came home to her husband of 23 years. But she wouldn't be home for long. Within a day she started feeling sick again. On March 15, she was admitted to nearby University Hospital. There would be more tubes, tests and monitors. James Craig was soon by her side. Steffan Tubbs: They had no idea what was wrong with her. Police say James Craig didn't stay long at first. Within half an hour, he drove home from the hospital. Then about an hour-and-a-half later, he returned, carrying food. Police say he then went into Angela Craig's room, alone. Soon after, Angela Craig had a seizure and once again her vital signs crashed. George Brauchler: It was critical. James Craig took photos of his wife as hospital staff tried to save her. George Brauchler: She is getting into dire, dire medical consequences. Angela Craig, once so full of life, was put on life support. George Brauchler: Doctors are struggling to figure out what in the hell is causing this? What is making her sick? What medical staff didn't know at the time was that days earlier, according to police, a package had arrived at James Craig's office. Authorities say what was in that package, ordered by James Craig himself, would become key evidence in this case. James Craig allegedly told a staff member ""that he would be receiving a personal package"" and ""not to open it."" Steffan Tubbs: Jim Craig had said don't open this package. Somebody did. She sees the words ""potassium cyanide."" Steffan Tubbs: Why are we getting potassium cyanide to a Colorado dentist's office? A PACKAGE MARKED POISON Angela Craig was on life support and fighting to survive. James Craig texted the photos he took to Michelle Redfearn, writing ""crash"" ""intubated"" and ""doc says she's 'very very worried'."" The couple raced to the hospital. Ryan Redfearn would later tell police he watched as James Craig broke down. Natalie Morales: He saw Craig crying after speaking to doctors about Angela's prognosis. George Brauchler: Yep. He did say he saw him crying afterwards. But according to police, Ryan Redfearn was far from convinced those tears were real. That's because, on his way to the hospital, he had gotten a call from a staff member at the office. The call was to alert Ryan Redfearn about that package marked potassium cyanide that had arrived at Summerbrook Dental — allegedly addressed and later given to James Craig. Steffan Tubbs: And there's the dominoes that are now falling one after the other. Ryan Redfearn led the way. George Brauchler: He does what any other normal person would do. According to police, while Angela Craig was on life support, Ryan Redfearn tells a nurse that James Craig ""recently ordered Potassium Cyanide,"" adding that there was no medical reason or purpose to order Potassium Cyanide for a dental practice."" Steffan Tubbs: The nurse, being a mandatory reporter, calls Aurora police, and I mean it's like that. Within five hours, probably even less, there is a member of the homicide unit with Aurora P.D. is at University Hospital. Police started asking questions. Then, according to the warrant, ""Ryan received a call from James's personal cell phone."" Natalie Morales: Tell me about that phone call. George Brauchler: I think Ryan and his wife are in the parking lot of the hospital when Jim calls them. According to police, James Craig asked Ryan Redfearn ""if he had said anything to the hospital staff."" Ryan Redfearn confirmed that he had and told James Craig that he knew what James Craig had ordered. And James Craig replied that the ""package was a ring for Angela and that he wanted to surprise her."" George Brauchler: And Ryan … says, ""… it's not a ring, we know what was in there."" I mean this is a testament to Ryan Redfearn. A decades-long friendship was about to be tested, then shattered. This tale was once again told in a text, revealed in that warrant, as the next morning James Craig pleaded with his pal and partner, texting in part: ""I want to make an urgent plea to you. … please don't talk to anyone … including any law enforcement officers. You are under no obligation to answer their questions unless you are served a subpoena and you will do more damage than good to my family by continuing to insert yourself into this."" Natalie Morales: How damning is that text in itself? George Brauchler: I'm trying to think of all the innocent applications of the phrase, please don't talk to the police. I can't come up with any. George Brauchler: It's a desperate effort to try to keep Ryan from cooperating any farther with law enforcement. But if that's what he was trying to do, it was too late. Police had already launched their investigation. On March 18, 2023, Angela Craig was taken off life support. A friend, wife, and mother of six was dead. Chelsea Otoya: I was in complete shock, in complete disbelief. … In my head, I'm like, this is crazy, it's not true. Chelsea Otoya: I thought maybe it was an accident. But investigators didn't think so. Just hours after Angela Craig died, Dr. James Craig would be arrested and charged with the first-degree murder of his wife. Steffan Tubbs: There's my dentist, a mugshot. James Craig would plead not guilty. Months later, Angela Craig's autopsy would be released. That autopsy states Angela Craig died from ""lethal concentrations of cyanide"" and ""a lethal concentration"" of tetrahydrozoline, the chemical found in some eye drops. And it says that Angela Craig had ""toxic concentrations"" of arsenic in her blood in those two earlier hospital visits. Steffan Tubbs: To think about what Angela Craig endured. … This woman was in agony, dying, for so long. Just a week before Angela Craig got sick, according to the warrant, James Craig set up a new email account using the alias ""Jim and Waffles"" and used it to research multiple poisons — all part of his plan, according to investigators, to murder Angela Craig. Steffan Tubbs: One particular Google search, ""how many grams of pure arsenic will kill a human?"" James Craig, investigators say, also found videos online with titles like ""Top 5 Undetectable Poisons That Show No Sign Of Foul Play."" And police say on the same day he did that online research, James Craig made a purchase — arsenic — and had it delivered straight to his family's mailbox. George Brauchler: I think he legitimately believed that he would be able to poison his wife, she would die, he would have her cremated. And then they'd … move on. Poison. Some call it the recipe for the perfect crime. A silent, invisible killer — no blood, no gun, no fingerprints. Even doctors can have a hard time spotting it. Dr. Jeff LaPoint: It's a pretty rare medical subspecialty. Doctor Jeff LaPoint is the director of the division of medical toxicology at San Diego's Kaiser Permanente Hospital. Dr. Jeff LaPoint: If it's a poison or a venom … that's what we specialize in. Natalie Morales: You're that guy? Dr. Jeff LaPoint: Yeah. So ""48 Hours"" asked him, and Dr. LaPoint focused in on the alleged actions of James Craig  and the final days of Angela Craig's life. He reviewed the arrest warrant for us, and some of the deadly drugs it lists. Natalie Morales: Let's start with arsenic. Dr. Jeff LaPoint: OK … yeah, arsenic is a very famous poison. It's … not detectable by taste or odor. LaPoint says Angela Craig's symptoms in those first two hospital visits are consistent with arsenic poisoning. Dr. Jeff LaPoint: Nausea and vomiting. Natalie Morales: Lower blood pressure, higher blood pressure? Dr. Jeff LaPoint: Generally lower. Natalie Morales: How much would kill a person? Dr. Jeff LaPoint: It does not take very much. But police say there was more. A week after he purchased that arsenic, they allege James Craig — as ""Jim and Waffles""— went back online. He ordered a second poison. Natalie Morales: Oleandrin, what is that? Dr. Jeff LaPoint: So, oleandrin is a toxin found in oleander. Natalie Morales: I'm thinking of those white flowers. Jeff LaPoint: Yeah, they're really beautiful. As lovely as a rose. Only deadly. Dr. Jeff LaPoint: It prevents the heart from beating very efficiently. But after three days, the oleandrin hadn't been delivered. That's when investigators say James Craig upped the ante. Police say he placed an order with a medical supply company for his strongest toxin yet: potassium cyanide. Dr. Jeff LaPoint: Cyanide is one of the most effective poisons that exist. Natalie Morales: Just a microdose could kill you then? Dr. Jeff LaPoint: Yeah, a very small amount per kilogram and you're not gonna live. … When you are poisoned with cyanide, you're being suffocated on a cellular level. … It's a very potent poison. … Your victim would die very rapidly. Cyanide is so deadly that you need a medical license to buy it. And police say that when Dr. James Craig placed his order from a medical supply company, he stated he needed it for a complex dental procedure. Dr. Jeff LaPoint: There's no use for potassium cyanide in my practice or I can't think of many medical practices. Natalie Morales: So, a dentist ordering arsenic, potassium cyanide and oleandrin … What does that suggest to you? Dr. Jeff LaPoint: Someone is trying to collect poison. But this father and husband would offer a very different story about why he wanted those deadly poisons. WAS INTEREST IN ANOTHER WOMAN A MOTIVE FOR MURDER? Detectives suspected James Craig had bought all those poisons to kill his wife, but they wanted to know why. They would find a lead miles away from Aurora on a trip James Craig made — and a woman he met — just before Angela Craig got sick. Steffan Tubbs: Doesn't it just always seem like there's another woman involved? Always, almost always. ""What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas."" It's a rule of the road there, but investigators allege it is yet one more rule James Craig didn't think he had to play by, when he met Karin Cain. Steffan Tubbs: Karin Cain, an orthodontist from Austin, Texas … She meets James Craig at a dental conference in Las Vegas. It was Feb. 23, a week-and-a-half before Angela Craig first went to the hospital. The doctor was traveling alone. And he rolled the dice. George Brauchler: They strike up a relationship. Steffan Tubbs: They hit it off … it's a whirlwind. A few weeks later, according to the warrant, Cain would fly to Colorado and rendezvous at a hotel with James Craig. He would use that newly created email, ""Jim and Waffles,"" to flirt with her. Skye Lazaro: It's not illegal to have affairs. Skye Lazaro is an experienced defense attorney familiar with cases involving poison. James Craig and his attorney declined our request for an interview. Lazaro reviewed the case against James Craig for ""48 Hours."" And she identified potential weaknesses. Skye Lazaro: Is it reasonable that you would kill your wife to be with someone that you had had a 10-day relationship with? Natalie Morales: The common defense strategy is affairs do not make a murderer. Skye Lazaro: Right. … One doesn't automatically mean you did the other. At the time she visited James Craig in Colorado, Cain did seem to know Angela Craig was very sick and in the hospital. In fact, she had sent a concerned e-mail to James Craig. It read in part: ""Hi honey, I am so sorry for what has transpired this week in your world. … I am praying for you and seeking God's wisdom for this time. I love you."" But there is no evidence to suggest Cain knew anything more. George Brauchler:  Nothing that I have seen … gives any indication that she knew that Jim was trying to kill his wife. And according to investigators, James Craig lied to Cain, telling her that he ""filed for divorce and was living separate in an apartment."" Steffan Tubbs: He gives the standard male, typical, ""I'm going through a divorce."" No, he's not. And a detective said she told them her relationship with James Craig was ""intimate but not sexual."" Cain sent ""48 Hours"" an email, writing: ""I had absolutely nothing to do with this horrific 'crime' and 'my heart is absolutely broken for Angela Craig and her family.'"" And she says she is ""cooperating fully with the police and prosecution."" Steffan Tubbs: Karin Cain … met the wrong guy at the wrong time. … She didn't know anything. Tubbs and Brauchler imply maybe no one knew anything about who James Craig really was. His pristine image — loving parent, church member, dedicated husband—now all being questioned. And as cops continued to investigate, another possible motive emerged. Steffan Tubbs: One of the things that surprised me in this story … is the financial duress that Summerbrook Dental was under. In fact, James Craig's business had filed for bankruptcy in 2020, and shortly after, his then-friend Ryan Redfearn signed on as a partner. Natalie Morales: Financial problems? George Brauchler: Financial problems. Natalie Morales: He was way in over his head then, in debt? George Brauchler: Way in over his head. And at a preliminary hearing in 2023, prosecutors argued that James Craig had ""about 3.4 million reasons to kill his wife"" — the value of Angela Craig's life insurance. George Brauchler: Jim had liabilities in excess of $2 million and we know that from some of the bankruptcy filings. But Lazaro says she's not convinced those financial problems give James Craig a motive for murder. Natalie Morales: Is this sort of the portrait of a desperate man? Skye Lazaro: Not necessarily. Skye Lazaro: We see businesses go through bankruptcy all the time and come out the other side. And, as for any poisons he may have ordered, Lazaro states those purchases may not even be illegal. Skye Lazaro: He can legitimately purchase it because he has a DEA number. Natalie Morales: As a doctor. As a dentist, right. Skye Lazaro: Right. Skye Lazaro: Just having it isn't murder. Natalie Morales: Mm-hmm. Administering it. Right. But according to the arrest paperwork, James Craig might have thought he had that figured out, too. Authorities say he could have slipped the poison into one of those protein shakes he so often made. Natalie Morales: A morning routine at home for example. George Brauchler: Yeah. On that morning of March  15 — the day Angela Craig would finally crash before she was taken to the hospital, she was home with James Craig. Investigators say that's when he may have made her one of those protein shakes and laced it with potassium cyanide. George Brauchler: It is tasteless. It is odorless. It is colorless. It is really hidable inside something like a shake. Natalie Morales: And highly lethal. George Brauchler: Highly lethal. But attorney Lazaro counters the evidence may not be there. She has reviewed the transcripts from that July 2023 preliminary hearing and says there's nothing there that shows James Craig put poison in Angela Craig's shakes. Skye Lazaro: They went and tested everything in the house and didn't find any trace evidence of there being arsenic or cyanide or anything in the protein powder, in the protein bottles. Skye Lazaro: The state hasn't presented you any evidence that the poison was actually in the drinks. And Lazaro says the defense can paint a picture of James Craig as a kind and attentive partner. Skye Lazaro: Jim's text messages to Angela are extremely loving and extremely caring. He repeatedly asks her how she's doing. He tells her he loves her. So if James Craig didn't poison his wife, who did? He had a story to tell about that. WHAT ANGELA CRAIG'S AUTOPSY SHOWED As Steffan Tubbs reported on his podcast, there may be another story to tell about James Craig and what happened to Angela Craig. The story wasn't about murder; it was about suicide. STEFFAN TUBBS (podcast): Craig says to the business partner on the phone … she was just playing chicken. According to the warrant, when Ryan Redfearn confronted James Craig about the cyanide, James Craig allegedly said that Angela Craig asked him to order it for her. That it was all a dare—kind of a deadly game of ""chicken."" Steffan Tubbs: According to Jim Craig … She's been threatening suicide. And this game of chicken is … Now … are you gonna take it? But according to that 52-page warrant, none of Angela Craig's family members told police she was suicidal. A more likely argument for the defense, says Lazaro, is that James Craig had been looking for cyanide not to kill Angela — but to kill himself. Skye Lazaro: There was some statements that he, in fact, was suicidal, not her. At that preliminary hearing in 2023, James Craig's defense team said he had spoken to a friend about his own past plans to die by suicide, and that ""Dr. Craig had made a statement"" to that friend that he was going to die by ""suicide with something that was not traceable."" The defense pointed out that James Craig ""suffered from depression"" and went to counseling in the past. And, the defense indicated, James Craig told Angela Craig at one point that he had actually drugged her years earlier, when he had tried to kill himself — hoping that while she was drugged, she wouldn't be able stop him. Natalie Morales: It sounds like there had been something that he had tried before with her. Skye Lazaro: Mm-hmm. ... That he had drugged her, so that she would fall asleep, so that he could go … essentially kill himself. And she wouldn't be there to render any aid or call for help. And remember when Angela Craig first started feeling sick, and she texted James Craig: ""I feel drugged""? James Craig's defense points out that he texted back, ""Given our history, I know that must be triggering. Just for the record, I didn't drug you."" The defense said this text supports the story of James Craig's past depression and suicide attempts. But Lazaro says it's unlikely the defense would try to tell a jury that Jim and Angela Craig were both trying to die by suicide. Skye Lazaro: You have to pick one at some point. Natalie Morales: Mm-hmm. Skye Lazaro: And it's either she's suicidal … or that he's suicidal … and this is why he bought the drugs. But perhaps the most compelling evidence authorities say they have is what Angela Craig left behind in her own blood. That autopsy revealed something investigators find remarkable—the levels of cyanide in Angela Craig's body actually increased while she was in the hospital on that final day. The possible implication? Tubbs wonders if prosecutors will contend James Craig gave his wife more poison in the hospital. Steffan Tubbs: If the allegations are true, this is about as cruel as it gets. Period. James Craig's defense has hired its own toxicologist. And, come his trial for murder, Lazaro says James Craig, innocent until proven guilty, may himself be portrayed as a victim — of cops too eager to make a fast arrest. Skye Lazaro: It's essentially a three-day investigation. James Craig's quick arrest, she says, could be a weakness for the state. Skye Lazaro: You decided from the get-go that this had to be poisoning … This was the foregone conclusion. … So you never went and looked for anything else. And as for that idea that poison might be the key to someone trying to commit the perfect crime, toxicologist Dr. Jeff LaPoint says that is just plain wrong. Jeff LaPoint: You're going to get caught. Natalie Morales: That's an important message. Jeff LaPoint: Yeah, very. Natalie Morales: There are ways that these will be traced, and you will be found. Jeff LaPoint: You'll be found. And while Angela Craig's friends and family are waiting for their day in court, they are left with photographs and their memories. Three of Jim and Angela Craig's six children are living with James Craig's brother. The other three are now adults living on their own, including their daughter Mira. On Mother's Day 2023, Mira wrote this message on social media: ""as of tomorrow my mom will be two months gone. I haven't the words to express the heartache my siblings and I feel every day."" Chelsea Otoya:  There's no words, you know? … the whole situation is just traumatic. Steffan Tubbs: This will all end, the lights will come down, the cameras leave. Thirty years from now, those kids who are in their teens right now still will be without a mom. Mira's last words in that post: ""I love you so much mama"" … ""we miss you."" In November 2024, prosecutors charged Jim Craig with soliciting the murder of one of the detectives on his case. Soon after this, Craig's attorney asked to be released from the case, citing a rule that allows attorneys to quit when they consider a client's behavior to be ""repugnant."" No new trial date has been set. ""48 HOURS"" POST MORTEM PODCAST Host Anne-Marie Green, Natalie Morales and ""48 Hours"" producer Sarah Prior go behind the scenes, discussing how James Craig used his license to order potassium cyanide, the suspicious ""jimandwaffles"" email address he created just weeks before his wife's death, and arguments the prosecution and defense might make when the case goes on trial.

LOZANO and PATRICK WHITTLE,2025-01-04T17:42:09.000Z,"HOUSTON (AP) — Winter weather brings various hazards that people have to contend with to keep warm and safe. These dangers can include carbon monoxide poisoning, hypothermia and frozen pipes that can burst and make homes unlivable. Public safety officials and experts say there are multiple ways people can prepare themselves to avoid these winter weather hazards and keep themselves safe. The hazards are on the radar this week because millions of people in the United States are set to be hit with moderate to heavy snow from Kansas City to Washington. Cold conditions are also gripping the East Coast. See for yourself — The Yodel is the go-to source for daily news, entertainment and feel-good stories. By signing up, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Policy. Staying safe inside your home Officials say that during a winter storm, people should stay indoors. But home heating systems running for hours can increase the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning as the deadly fumes can be produced by furnaces, stoves and heaters, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Carbon monoxide can also be created when people use portable generators or run cars in their garages to stay warm or charge their phones. Dr. Alex Harding, assistant professor of emergency medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said that because carbon monoxide is odorless and colorless, people won’t necessarily be aware of it. “The symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning can be really insidious. They can sneak up on patients and can range from just developing a headache or maybe a little bit of nausea to all the way to losing consciousness and seizures,” he said. Dealing with hypothermia The cold weather hitting much of the East Coast has the ability to be dangerous or deadly because of unsafe exposure to elements. This week's winter storms are tracking to the south, and cold air will likely be present as far south as Georgia, said Jon Palmer, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Gray, Maine. The cold temperatures could sneak up on people in parts of the country that have largely experienced a mild winter so far. “Really cold temperatures and winds can make temperatures feel a lot colder, and the result of that could be cold air that could eventually lead to frostbite at a much faster rate or hypothermia at a much faster rate than normal,” Palmer said. Prolonged exposure to frigid temperatures can put people at risk to hypothermia, a condition that happens when one’s body loses heat faster than it can produce it. “Hypothermia is definitely one of the bigger concerns, especially if we do have any kind of certainty in like power grids or electricity failing,” Harding said. The danger of hypothermia is greater for someone who is outside, exposed to wind gusts and isn’t wearing appropriate clothing or has clothing that gets wet. “If they have a safe place that’s warm, where they can hunker down, where they have water and food and all those kind of necessities … then that’s going to limit their exposure to those risks,” Harding said. But vulnerable populations like people with disabilities or homeless individuals can have problems finding a warm and safe place to stay. Protecting your home's pipes Frozen pipes in a home during severe winter weather is a particular problem in parts of the South because such equipment is often located outside structures. But other parts of the country also have to deal with this problem. Jose Parra, a master plumber with Abacus Plumbing, Air Conditioning & Electrical in Houston, advises people to insulate any pipes that are exposed to the outside, turn off and drain sprinkler systems and let faucets inside a home drip during freezing temperatures so water can run through the pipes and protect them. “A lot of what we’re fixing, I would say 80% to 90%, could have been prevented with just a little bit of work ahead of time,” Parra said. Electric vehicle troubles Experts acknowledge that cold weather can be hard for electric vehicles, but they say with some planning and a little adjustment, owners should be able to travel pretty much as normal. Inside EV batteries, lithium ions flow through a liquid electrolyte, producing electricity. But they travel more slowly through the electrolyte when it gets cold and don’t release as much energy. That cuts into the range and can deplete a battery faster. In the short run, automakers are likely to come up with better ways to protect battery life and warm them for charging, Neil Dasgupta, associate professor of mechanical and materials science engineering at the University of Michigan, told The Associated Press earlier this year. And there are new battery chemistries in development that are more resilient in cold weather. ___ Tom Krisher contributed to this story.",1,[],2025-01-06 04:07:37,2025-01-06 19:11:56

https://sports.yahoo.com/why-did-patriots-fire-jerod-mayo-as-head-coach-after-just-1-season-025612040.html,Why did Patriots fire Jerod Mayo as head coach after just 1 season?,,Sports,Yahoo Sports,6 min read,"Did Mayo get a fair shake after a single, abysmal season in New England?",jason owens,2025-01-06T02:56:12.000Z,"After a single season as Patriots head coach, Jerod Mayo's time in New England is done. The Patriots didn't bother waiting until Monday to dismiss him. They announced Mayo's firing Sunday afternoon with a statement from team owner Robert Kraft, just hours after a season-ending win over a Bills team that was resting key players ahead of the playoffs. A former Patriots linebacker who spent his entire eight-season playing career with New England, Mayo was a member of Bill Belichick's coaching staff for five seasons before becoming Belichick's successor last January. Expectations were low in 2024 on a talent-depleted roster built around a rookie quarterback. So what went wrong for Mayo that prompted the Patriots to give up on one of their own, who was hand-selected by Kraft, after just one season? Per a report from The Athletic's Jeff Howe, there was doubt about the hiring from the start among Patriots insiders. According to the report, members of the Belichick regime were skeptical from the beginning that Mayo was ready for the job when he was hired at 37 years old. Said skeptics believed that Mayo ""needed more experience game planning, involvement in play calling, handling bigger situational decisions,"" and that New England's 4-13 season played out ""about how we thought,"" per the report. Mayo's inexperience shone early in the season around the most important decision that he would make: Who would start at quarterback? Drake Maye was the QB of the future when the Patriots drafted him last spring. There was debate in the preseason over whether it made sense to play Maye as a rookie on a roster lacking talent at skill positions and on the offensive line. Before Maye took over in Week 6, Mayo initially decided that Maye should learn from the bench and named veteran Jacoby Brissett as New England's starter. The decision didn't raise eyebrows. Starting Maye on the bench instead of risking his health and development behind a shaky offensive line made sense. But how Mayo reached his decision certainly did. Before announcing Brissett as starter, Mayo declared that Maye had outplayed Brissett on the field, an assessment that was backed up by preseason statistics. ""It’s true competition, and I would say at this current point, Drake has outplayed Jacoby,"" Mayo said on Aug. 26. The proclamation suggested that Maye could end up as New England's starter. Two days later, Mayo named Brissett as the starter, setting Mayo up to walk back his previous comments. The public explanation didn't make sense, even if the unspoken sentiment that Maye was better off on the bench did. It wasn't a fireable offense, of course but it amounted to a public gaffe that helped set the tone for Mayo's lone season on the job. And it was a shock to the system in New England after two-plus decades of a Belichick regime playing its cards extremely close to the vest. Then came an early season statement from Mayo that drew direct criticism from Belichick himself. The Patriots traveled to London to face the Jaguars in Week 6, Maye's first game as a starter. They opened a 10-0 lead only to give up 25 straight points en route to a 32-16 loss. After the game, Mayo criticized Patriots players as ""soft."" ""We're a soft football team across the board,"" Mayo told reporters postgame. ""We talk about what makes a tough football team, and that's being able to run the ball, that's being able to stop the run, and that's being able to cover kicks. And we did none of those today."" Belichick took issue with those comments about a roster made up of many of the same players he had coached the previous season. He expressed his thoughts on the ""Pat McAfee Show"" the following Monday. ""I'm kind of hurt for those guys, because to call them soft, they're not soft,"" Belichick said. ""They were the best team in the league last year against the run. ... I feel bad for the defensive players on that one because those guys, that's a tough group. ... Those guys are all tough players. Like, they'll strap it up and go."" Calling his players soft in public also wasn't a fireable offense. But it was a sign of continued turbulence in New England. And as the season wore on, play on the field continued to suffer, and the losses piled up. The defeats were accompanied by game management decisions that repeatedly drew criticism in Patriots media. New England entered Sunday's finale ranked 31st in the league in yards per game, ahead of only the likewise abysmal Bears. Its defense was ranked 21st in yards allowed and 23rd in points allowed per game. The Patriots finished the season with a minus-128 point differential, good for 28th in the league. Outside of Maye's upside, there was little positive to take from a 4-13 campaign that produced a last-place finish in the AFC East. Near the end, public sentiment had turned against Mayo. He faced ""fire Mayo"" chants at Gillette Stadium during a 40-7 home loss to the Chargers in Week 17 that dropped the Patriots to 3-13. A week later, the Patriots did just that. Is it fair for the Patriots to have fired Mayo after his first year as a head coach? Mayo's roster was one of the worst in the league, and the expectations this season were not to win. Does it make more sense to give him another year to learn from his mistakes and develop? The decision in New England was ultimately no. And it was made amid an urgency to get things right around Maye and the hope that he ultimately leads the franchise back into contention. The decision on Sunday gives the Patriots a jumpstart on the coaching carousel as they seek out Mayo's successor. Will they look to another former Patriot in free-agent head coach Mike Vrabel? He's a coveted candidate who's expected to draw wide interest a year removed from his last season as Titans head coach. Will they look to an offensive-minded coach to amplify Maye's development? Whomever they hire, the Patriots want to have their choice of candidates, and starting the process early gives them a leg up. Fair or not, Mayo's time in New England is done. And the old idiom stands true. When following a legend, it's better to replace the guy who replaced the guy rather than to replace the guy.",334,[],2025-01-06 04:07:37,2025-01-09 00:31:22

At CES 2025, Samsung unveiled the Neo QLED 8K QN990F and QN900F, plus the Neo QLED 4K QN90F, QN80F and QN70F. The TVs come with glare-free technology and a suite of AI features driven by Samsung Vision AI. The Neo QLED 8K QN990F is Samsung’s top-of-the-line model and it features a super-slim, minimalist footprint and an NQ8 AI Gen3 Processor. Its AI abilities include proprietary 8K upscaling, frame-by-frame HDR remastering, adaptive sound, color boosting and AI Mode, which automatically optimizes picture and sound based on the content on screen. These represent updates to existing Samsung AI efforts. In line with the minimalist aesthetic, Samsung is also shipping a Wireless One Connect Box for the QN990F, allowing users to keep their TV space wire-free. This is similar to LG’s Zero Connect Box, and it’s a clever bit of clutter-clearing equipment. Samsung claims the Wireless One Connect Box works at a distance of up to 10 meters, even with obstacles in its transmission path. Meanwhile, Samsung’s QLED 4K line features an NQ4 AI Gen3 Processor, 4K AI Upscaling Pro, improved picture quality and a 165Hz refresh rate. The QN80F has a 100-inch option, while the QN90F comes in 115 inches. Samsung’s AI ambitions cover all of its 2025 TVs, with Vision AI delivering new personalization and optimization features across the board. Click to Search can identify people, places and products on-screen and then provide relevant information about these things in real time. Identify the actors in a scene, specific pieces of clothing or the displayed location, for instance. In a similar vein, the new Samsung Food ability can identify the grub on your TV and even provide relevant recipes. This feature can also analyze the contents of your connected Samsung fridge and build specific shopping lists, or prompt you to order groceries or takeout from the TV using third-party apps. Samsung AI Home Security turns your TV into a house-monitoring hub. It leverages the built-in microphone and connected cameras on your Samsung TV, and can detect unusual sounds and movements. It then delivers alerts to your phone or directly on the TV. Live Translate delivers real-time subtitle translations, and Generative Wallpaper allows users to create dynamic, personalized art canvases. In OLED land, Samsung is introducing the S95F, S90F and S85F. As the flagship in this line, the S95F includes an NQ4 AI Gen3 Processor, improved glare-free technology, a 165Hz variable refresh rate and a brighter display than ever before. There's also The Frame Pro, a TV so special that we have a separate story all about its new features. As usual, Samsung is primed to reveal more details about pricing and availability of its new hardware during CES 2025.",0,[],2025-01-06 04:07:37,2025-01-06 22:43:34

The storm will first impact the Central Plains later Saturday and spread into the Ohio Valley on Sunday before reaching the Mid-Atlantic late Sunday and into Monday. Northeastern Kansas into north-central Missouri could see over 15 inches. ""For some, this could be the heaviest snowfall in over a decade,"" the National Weather Service said. Blizzard and whiteout conditions are expected in the central Plains, making driving conditions either dangerous or impossible without the risk of becoming stranded. At least 8 inches of snow is expected in Indiana and central Kansas, while dangerous sleet or freezing rain is forecast between eastern Kansas and the Ozarks toward the Ohio Valley, according to forecasters. Meanwhile, the Central Appalachians will face freezing rain and ice, posing a risk of power outages and hazardous travel. Winter storm warnings and winter weather advisories remain in effect from western Pennsylvania and West Virginia to far western Maryland, where snow totals of at least 6 inches are expected. Lake effect snow warnings are also set to continue from northeast Ohio, far northwest Pennsylvania, as well as parts of western and northwest New York State. Snow totals could reach 1 to 2 feet, according to the weather service. ""Over a dozen states are forecast to be impacted by one or more aspects of this storm,"" AccuWeather Meteorologist Brandon Buckingham said. A winter storm watch is put in place when weather conditions favor a winter storm that threatens life or property, according to the National Weather Service. A winter weather advisory is included when there is expected to be any one or more of the following: Snow 3 to 5 inches within 12 hours; sleet less than half an inch; freezing rain with sleet or snow; or blowing snow. A winter storm warning comes when heavy snow of at least 6 inches in 12 hours or 8 inches of 24 hours, or sleet over half an inch is expected. Here's how many Americans are under winter storm alerts Saturday afternoon: Winter storm warning: Over 32,458,000 people, including a stretch from Kansas to Virginia. Winter weather advisory: Over 14,616,000 people across parts of Montana, the Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and more. Winter storm watch: Over 11,744,000 people, mostly in Mid-Atlantic states including Maryland and Delaware. Forecasters urged drivers to check their weather forecasts and prepare for potentially dangerous or impossible conditions over the weekend. From the Central Plains region into the Ohio Valley, severe travel delays are likely, the weather service said. Blizzard conditions are likely in the Central Plains, with wind gusts over 35 mph and heavy snow. ""Whiteout conditions will make travel extremely hazardous, with impassable roads and a high risk of motorists becoming stranded,"" the weather service said. From eastern Kansas to the Ozarks and Ohio Valley, travel will also be dangerous with likely fallen trees and power outages, the weather service said. Over one-quarter inch of ice is expected to accumulate. Lingering cold air after this winter storm could keep ice and snow on the ground for several days, AccuWeather said. Colder than average temperatures will impact much of the country next week, from the Rockies eastward, according to the weather service. Temperatures will be 10 to 20 degrees lower than normal for this time of year from the Central Plains and Mid-Mississippi and Ohio Valleys through the Appalachians next week, forecasters said. ""Brutally cold temperatures will extend through the upcoming week,"" the weather service in St. Louis, Missouri, said. Power outages could make the situation more dangerous as it dips into single digits overnight in the region, the weather service there said.

In a short Telegram post Sunday, the head of the Ukrainian Presidential Office, Andriy Yermak, said: “Kursk region, good news, Russia is getting what it deserves.” The Ukrainian military first launched an incursion into Kursk in August and has held much of the territory it took, despite efforts by Russian and recently deployed North Korean troops to drive Ukrainian units back across the border. The Russian defense ministry on Monday claimed that its forces had repelled Kyiv’s counterattack. The ministry said that Russian units, supported by aviation and artillery, launched a “decisive” response and destroyed Ukraine’s main forces that had gathered near the village of Berdin, some 15 kilometers (9 miles) from the border. It added that Russian forces “prevented the Ukrainian Armed Forces from breaking through.” CNN is unable to verify battlefield reports. The Kursk offensive – the first ground invasion of Russia by a foreign power since World War II – took Russia and Ukraine’s allies by surprise when it was launched. Kyiv’s troops advanced quickly, though Russia eventually began to push their forces back; the line of control has not changed dramatically in recent months. On Saturday, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said that in battles near the village of Makhnovka, the Russian army lost up to a battalion of North Korean soldiers and Russian paratroopers. A battalion is normally several hundred troops. Unofficial Russian military blogs, which often provide reliable reporting on the Ukraine conflict, acknowledged the fighting on Sunday. One said that the Ukrainians were pushing north towards Berdin. “The enemy has thrown reserves into the offensive in Kursk region,” said one blog Sunday. “For the breakthrough, the AFU covered the area with powerful radio electronic warfare systems, hampering the work of our UAVs (drones),” the blog said. “There are small arms battles, our artillery and tanks are actively working against the enemy.” A second blog carried a similar account, saying the offensive had begun from the Sudzha area, but the Ukrainians had also landed paratroopers and intensified fighting in other directions. “In this offensive the enemy uses mine clearance trawls, tanks and other armored vehicles,” the blog said, adding that frosty ground was enabling the attack, but that was not expected to last. It added that Russian bombers were in action. Ukrainian and Western assessments say that some 11,000 North Korean troops are deployed in the Kursk region, where Ukrainian forces occupy swathes of territory after staging the cross-border incursion. A senior Ukrainian officer told CNN that the Russians had begun a heavy bombardment of the town of Sudzha, which the Ukrainians took last August. Col. Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, press officer for the military commandant’s office in the Kursk region, told CNN there were swarms of drones in the area and constant explosions, with missiles landing directly on the town. “The enemy is dismantling the city floor by floor, block by block, trying to clear the city before the main assault,” Dmytrashkivskyi said. He said civilians holed up in a boarding school wanted to leave but Russia had not consented to their transportation. “There are currently approximately 2,000 people there. About 39 people have been killed by air and artillery strikes, and more than 100 have been wounded.” In eastern Ukraine, the Russian military has reported advances near the town of Kurakhove, a critical area of the battlefield in Donetsk region. The unofficial Ukrainian monitoring group DeepState said that Russian forces had advanced in Kurakhove and Toretsk, and published video of a column of Russian vehicles entering the village of Yelyzavetivka before coming under heavy fire. A Russian military blog claimed that a special forces detachment had raised the Russian flag on the western outskirts of Kurakhove. Russian President Vladimir Putin declined to say when Russia would recapture the southern Kursk region after a phone-in question at his year-end news conference last month. “Our guys are fighting, there is a battle going on right now, and serious battles. It is unclear why, there was no military sense in the Ukrainian Armed Forces entering the Kursk region, or holding on there now as they are doing, throwing their best units there to be slaughtered,” Putin said. One possible motive behind Kyiv’s decision to enter Russia was to improve its hand ahead of any potential future ceasefire negotiations. Incoming US President Donald Trump has said he would end the war “in 24 hours,” but not how, and has demurred over future military aid to Ukraine. Last week, Zelensky said that the North Korean military has been facing severe losses and accused Russia of sending them to the battlefield with “minimal protection.” This story has been updated with additional developments.

Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) — a frequent Donald Trump critic after his 2020 election loss — revealed why it’s “interesting” that critics tag him with the “RINO” acronym, which stands for “Republican in name only.” “The reality is the entire Republican Party today is the RINO. They’re Republicans in name only,” said Kinzinger in an interview with Salon shared Saturday. “They hold the title to the Republican Party, a lot of them still think they’re holding a legacy, but that’s exactly right, it’s gone,” he continued. Kinzinger, the focus of a new documentary, “The Last Republican,” from “Hot Tub Time Machine” director Steve Pink, added that “what it means now to be a Republican” is that you’re “driven by anger” and division. “I think what they stand for is supporting culture war, rage, and one person, one personality, and that’s Donald Trump. Now, they’ll never admit it, but that’s the reality of it,” he said. Kinzinger, one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump over his role in the deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, served on the House committee that investigated the insurrection. He endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in last year’s election and, in a speech at the Democratic National Convention, declared that he was “putting our country first.” In a separate interview with Forbes published Friday, Kinzinger said he’s built “new alliances” in recent years and has realized he’s “probably closer to a Democrat now because of how the Republican Party has changed.” “The Democrats are now the party that’s defending America’s role in the world, defending Ukraine, which I’m really passionate about,” said Kinzinger, who predicted that the GOP is “toast for a while” as “Trumpism” won’t “survive past these four years.” The former congressman, in his interview with Salon, said he thinks Trump is “already a lame duck,” before noting that his control over his base could pose a “concern” for Republicans when the president-elect’s second term ends. “If you think about George W. Bush toward the end of his second term, Republicans were falling away. That won’t happen with Trump,” Kinzinger said. “All those Republicans who should be falling away will still have to face reelection even though Donald Trump doesn’t,” he continued. Kinzinger added that he doesn’t think the GOP can be “saved in the near term,” but he hopes people don’t “give up on it.” “Because the reality is that there’s probably forever only going to be two major parties in this country, and the Republican Party will be one of them,” he said. “We can either write it off and lose elections, with such consequences as we’ve just had, or we can continue to fight inside.” Canadian Lawmaker Blasts 'Loser' Kevin O'Leary For Marching In Mar-A-Lago 'Grifters Parade' ‘Fatal Mistake’: Democrats Blame DOJ As Trump Escapes Accountability For Jan. 6 Trump Ordered To Appear For Sentencing In Hush Money Trial",4.4k,[],2025-01-06 04:08:32,2025-01-06 19:12:05

Refresh to see the latest. Indiana's first snowstorm of the year — predicted by the National Weather Service Indianapolis for days — is well underway in Indianapolis and across the state. Areas around the city had seen 4 to 6 inches of snow by mid-evening, covering roads faster than crews could clear them. The latest NWS forecast calls for a total of at least 8 inches of snow along and south of Interstate 70 by Monday evening, with a possibility of freezing drizzle. North of the interstate, light to moderate snow is expected to continue for a total of 4 to 8 inches accumulation by Monday evening. A winter storm warning remains in effect. Travel could be difficult as roads, bridges and overpasses will likely become slick and hazardous due to continued snow accumulation and freezing drizzle over parts of Central Indiana. Strong winds and the weight of snow may also bring down power lines, causing sporadic outages. More than 100 flights were canceled at Indianapolis International Airport on Sunday, and 50 more have already been canceled for Monday. Here's what to know about the storm and its impact so far: Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department officers were called to more than 80 accidents, slideoffs and disabled vehicles beginning at noon Sunday, the agency said at 7:40 p.m. ""If you don’t have to be out - stay home!"" IMPD said on X, formerly Twitter. Roads and interstates throughout the region are snow covered. Plows are working on roadways downtown and major thoroughfares across the city. You can track progress through the city’s Snow Force Viewer. You can see traffic updates from the Indiana Department of Transportation at 511.org. As snow kept falling Sunday evening, school district leaders across the Indianapolis area made the call to replace in-person classes with remote instruction Monday or to cancel coursework entirely. Read IndyStar's list of closures here: School closures: Is school closed or delayed Monday? Here's the list for the Indianapolis area All Indianapolis Public Library locations will be closed Monday due to weather, the library network announced late Sunday via email and a notice posted online. Patrons are encouraged to visit indypl.org for additional updates and use the library’s website for services. More than 200 flights scheduled to fly to or from the Indianapolis airport Sunday and Monday have been canceled or delayed due to heavy snowfall brought on by Winter Storm Blair. Flight tracking website FlightAware shows 113 canceled flights Sunday — about 24% of outbound flights and 43% of inbound flights Sunday — and airlines have started canceling Monday flights, as well. At Chicago O'Hare International Airport, 336 flights had been delayed and 178 canceled as of 6:45 p.m. IND traffic: Snow delays or cancels flights for both Sunday and Monday Snowfall totals mounted Sunday evening, with some areas of Southern Indiana recording as much as 8.5 inches.

See snowfall totals around the state. 5:55 p.m.: Central Indiana residents took to social media Sunday afternoon to document the accumulating snow as they ventured outside their homes and into their neighborhoods. Some braved temperatures in the low 20s to shop for last-minute groceries and goods. Others tried to go to work, while some saw an opportunity to play. They posted before and after pictures of their yards and shared videos of themselves frolicking in the snow. Entrepreneurs on Nextdoor.com advertised their snow removal services to would-be customers, and others inquired about borrowing shovels to earn some cash. One Greenwood company posted drone footage on Facebook.com, showing how the blanketing snow changed the landscape over the course of several hours. 4:45 p.m.: Local agencies are calling for only essential travel in a number of Indiana counties as a wintry mix in the state's southern half makes roads perilous. County emergency management workers have issued travel watches in 19 Indiana counties, signaling conditions bad enough to recommend traveling only for work or emergencies. All are in Southern Indiana except for Hamilton County. Four Indiana counties near Louisville are under travel warnings, the highest level signaling residents should refrain from all travel, according to a statewide map. All other counties along or south of the I-70 corridor, including Marion, are under a lower warning called a travel advisory. This means hazards are largely confined to certain areas. The National Weather Service predicts that a wintry mix with some sleet and freezing drizzle will continue in the Vincennes region and hit the Bloomington area by 6 p.m. Indianapolis is forecast to receive heavy snowfall until midnight. 3:30 p.m.: Snow coverage will gradually spread north in Central Indiana on Sunday afternoon as bouts of heavy snowfall make driving increasingly hazardous, according to NWS Indianapolis. Starting in the state's southwestern portion, sleet will mix in with snow at times. South of I-70, approximately 2-5 inches of snow have already been reported, with more than 8 inches measured in the town of Ferdinand. 3 p.m.: The city of Indianapolis has begun its plan to deploy a fleet of 70 snowplow drivers per shift as snowfall starts to accumulate. This afternoon, crews will keep laying down salt to combat ice as they start plowing snow from the roadways, according to Auboni Hart, a spokeswoman for the Department of Public Works. Officials urge drivers to keep a safe distance from snowplows, especially if trying to pass them from behind. The snowplow blades are set at an angle to divert snow to the roadside and can slice cars that come too close, Hart said. ""That plow will treat these cars like a can opener and rip them right open, so we don't want that for them,"" Hart told IndyStar Sunday afternoon. Track where snowplows are in real-time using the city's Indy Snow Force map. NWS Indianapolis had reported 1.4 inches of snow by 1 p.m. Sunday, and more than 8 inches are expected. 2:15 p.m.: Multiple crashes and patches of ice have been reported across the Indianapolis area as snowfall picks up this afternoon. At least three crashes had occurred on I-465 by 2:15 p.m., closing down parts of the roadway, according to INDOT. In northeast Indianapolis, between 71st Street and 56th Street, the southbound left lane was closed for a crash. Just north of that area, at the intersection of I-465 and I-69, another crash slowed down southbound traffic. Near the intersection of I-465 and I-70, a crash closed the northbound right lane. A crash on I-65 near Beech Grove had closed part of the roadway but was cleaned up by 2:15 p.m. Icy conditions are being reported at the interchange between I-74 and I-465, in southeast Indianapolis, and in downtown Indianapolis on Market Street near I-65. INDOT also reports black ice on the Georgetown Road bridge over I-65, in northwest Indianapolis. Gov. Eric Holcomb activated the Indiana National Guard Sunday to assist with the winter storm system barreling through the region. The activation includes a highway assistance team to help stranded motorists and 122 Hoosier Guardsmen working across seven Indiana National Guard armories in Bedford, Edinburgh, Evansville, Indianapolis, New Albany, Shelbyville and Washington. The activation will remain in place through Tuesday, the National Guard said. Before heading out the door, check the status of road conditions, including road closures, crashes and live webcams using Indiana's online Trafficwise map at 511in.org, or visit our gridlock guide page for live traffic cams and more. INDOT's CARS Program provides information about road conditions, closures and width and weight restrictions. The website has a color-coded map of Indiana's highways and highlights hazardous road conditions and travel delays. The interactive map also shows road work warnings, closures, roadway restrictions and other information helpful to drivers. 12:15 p.m.: While most of Southern Indiana will see up to 12 inches of snow, areas north will see wide differences in snowfall totals, NWS says. Indianapolis is predicted to get 6 to 8 inches while areas north such as Hamilton County could see anywhere from 4 to 8 inches. As of 11 a.m., a light but steady snow had begun to fall along the I-70 corridor and south of the city, according to NWS Indianapolis. The further you travel south in the state, the heavier the snow. Parts of southwest Indiana have already received up to 4 inches of snow by 11 a.m., according to NWS. ""We're already seeing snow-covered roadways [on the south side], so if you're down in Martinsville or Franklin or down toward Bloomington, anything that you need to do, you might want to do really over the next hour, and then kind of settle in,"" said NWS Indianapolis meteorologist Mike Ryan. Meanwhile, the north side of I-70 remained largely dry for now. Snow will continue to fall and pick up steam in the mid-afternoon around 3 or 4 p.m. in the Indianapolis metro area, worsening road conditions as the day goes on. A light sprinkling of snow was falling on the north side of the city by 11 a.m. ""As we've been saying for the last day or so, we expect the primary more significant impact here in the area to probably hold off until late afternoon into Sunday night,"" Ryan said. ""Things are not going to be too bad north of the city until probably closer to sunset."" The 11 a.m. update follows much of the predicted forecast from the last few days, with road conditions expected to worsen throughout the day Sunday and into Monday. The Indianapolis Colts are set to take on the Jacksonville Jaguars at 1 p.m. at Lucas Oil Stadium in the team's season finale as scheduled. The stadium roof and window will be closed, owner Jim Irsay announced on social media Saturday. Wondering the best way to measure the amount of snow that's fallen outside? NWS Indianapolis posted a video showing best practices for measuring. NWS recommends placing a piece of cardboard outside before the snow hits and using a yardstick to measure accumulating snow. If you don't have a piece of cardboard outside, simply place a yardstick in the ground and measure to the nearest tenths of an inch. Don't forget to measure in multiple spots. 7 a.m.: Early Sunday meteorologists predicted Indianapolis could see more than 8 inches of snow during the storm. Areas south of the I-70 corridor could see more than 10 inches of snow. A major Winter storm will bring significant snow and mixed precipitation to central Indiana today through Monday.

In a series of tweets posted late Saturday night, the Tesla CEO and confidant of President-elect Donald Trump expressed fury at House members who voted nay in September 2024 on the “Violence Against Women by Illegal Aliens Act” put forward by Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC). “These awful people all need to be voted out, either in the primaries or the general election,” he wrote. “They sully the Capitol Building with their presence.” It marks the latest in Musk’s high-profile attacks on Congress since Trump was elected—his ire was previously trained on the GOP when he torpedoed a Republican-backed government spending bill last month. What Musk left out of his latest attack, trained on Democrats, is that opponents of Mace’s legislation said, despite its name, the bill won’t actually do anything and may end up punishing victims of domestic and sexual violence. Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY), who voted nay, accused Mace of putting forward “purely a messaging bill,” invoking a term for legislation introduced for political reasons to rile up voters and that either has little chance of passing or does little to address the issue it raises. Mace claimed the bill “ensures predators who pose a threat and have been previously convicted of sexual assault, domestic violence and other heinous crimes are turned away or immediately deported.” Nadler noted these things are already illegal and grounds for deportation. “It would be almost entirely redundant to current law. Let me repeat: because all of the conduct described here already constitutes a deportable offense, this bill would ensure that no additional dangerous individuals would face immigration consequences. Zero,” said Nadler (D-NY). Nadler also noted that nearly 180 groups as part of the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence opposed the legislation because it used a broader definition of domestic violence—used in the Violence Against Women Act for grants and funding, not in criminal law—that could sweep up women who use self-defense against their abusers. In other words, victims could be deported. “I guess I shouldn’t be surprised considering that this is the same party supporting a man who was found liable for sexual assault and bragged about grabbing and forcibly kissing women without their consent,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), who opposed the bill. “At first, we thought it was a satirical story in the Onion,” wrote the Charleston City Paper of Mace’s legislation. “The bill is unnecessary. And what’s worse, experts say its text is so vague and poorly drafted that it’s likely to get survivors–yes, survivors–of sexual violence tossed out of the country."" The bill passed in the House in a 266-158. It was referred to, but noted voted on, in the Senate before the end of the end of the 118th session of Congress, and would need to be reintroduced in the new Congress to be considered again. Mace, meanwhile, voted against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act in 2021.",820,[],2025-01-06 04:08:32,2025-01-06 04:08:32

She won for her go-for-broke performance as an aging celebrity in the body horror satire “The Substance.” “I’m in shock right now. I’ve been doing this a long time — like, over 45 years — and this is the first time I’ve ever won anything as an actor,” Moore, 62, said from the stage. “I’m so humbled and grateful.” More from Variety Sebastian Stan Wins Golden Globe for 'A Different Man': 'Our Ignorance and Discomfort Around Disability and Disfigurement Has to End Now' 'Conclave' Screenwriter Defends Film Amid Megyn Kelly's Claims It's 'Anti-Catholic': 'I Stand By It' Kieran Culkin Wins Golden Globe for 'A Real Pain,' Says 'Whole Speech Is Gone' After Taking Shot of Tequila With Mario Lopez Moore has been nominated for four Globes across nearly 25 years, scoring prior nods for “Ghost” in 1991 and two for the anthology series “If These Walls Could Talk” in 1997. While she’s won an ensemble award at the Independent Spirit Award for 2012’s “Margin Call,” the prize for “The Substance” is, indeed, Moore’s only solo acting honor from a major awards body. In securing the prize for “The Substance,” Moore beat Amy Adams (“Nightbitch”), Cynthia Erivo (“Wicked”), Karla Sofía Gascón (“Emilia Perez”), Mikey Madison (“Anora”) and Zendaya (“Challengers”). In her emotional speech, Moore, who rose to fame in the 1980s through films like “Blame It on Rio,” “St. Elmo’s Fire” and “About Last Night” before starring in box office successes like “Ghost,” “A Few Good Men,” “Indecent Proposal” and “Disclosure,” reflected on her earlier days in Hollywood. She claimed a discouraging power broker had suggested to her that commercial acclaim and awards attention were mutually exclusive. “Thirty years ago, I had a producer tell me I was a popcorn actress. At that time, I made that mean that this,” she said in reference to the shiny trophy in her hand, “is not something I was allowed to have. That I could do movies that were successful and made a lot of money, but that I couldn’t be acknowledged. I bought in, and I believed that. That corroded me over time, to the point where I thought a few years ago that maybe this was it. Maybe I was complete. Maybe I had done what I was supposed to do.” Moore revealed she was at a “low point” when a “magical, bold, courageous, out-of-the-box, absolutely bonkers script come across my desk.” She’s referring, of course, to director Coralie Fargeat’s “The Substance,” in which her character Elisabeth Sparkle, a fading Hollywood star, turns 50 and uses a black market drug that literally splits her open to produce a younger, more perfect version of herself (played by Margaret Qualley). Naturally, the bootleg pharmaceutical leads to some unexpected side effects. The film, which received five Globe nominations in total, also scored at the box office with $77.8 million against a $17.5 million budget. “The universe told me: You are not done,” Moore said before thanking “people who stood by me and believed in me when I haven’t believed in myself.” She hoisted up her statue, referring to the hardware as “marker of my wholeness” and “[reminder] that I do belong,” before concluding with words of wisdom. “In those moments when we don’t think we are smart enough or pretty enough or skinny enough or successful enough, or basically, just not enough…,” Moore said. “I had a woman say to me, ‘Just know, you will never be enough, but you can know the value of your worth if you just put down the measuring stick.'” Best of Variety New Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week What's Coming to Disney+ in January 2025 What's Coming to Netflix in January 2025 Sign up for Variety's Newsletter.

Some cause minimal damage, and others have long-term effects. As a natural leaper who explodes into the air, Jonathan Kuminga has rolled his ankle multiple times throughout his basketball life. The sprain to his right ankle he sustained Saturday night in the Warriors’ win against the Memphis Grizzlies wasn’t his most painful, but will likely require the longest recovery time. The Warriors on Sunday announced an MRI revealed Kuminga has a significant lateral sprain that will sideline him for at least the next three weeks. “It’s probably going to take a little bit longer than usual,” Kuminga said at his locker on Sunday. “Just trying to heal better.” Kuminga revealed it is the outside of his ankle that he injured. He says he knew right away that something was wrong. Pain was immediate, which is why he motioned to the Warriors’ bench to take him out, knowing his night was done then and there. The 22-year-old is hoping age is in his favor to return as fast as possible. “I’m still young, so my body heals faster,” Kuminga said. “I hope it heals faster this time. But the last time I had an ankle injury it healed fast.” But Kuminga will listen to director of sports medicine and performance Rick Celebrini, following his lead and the rest of the Warriors’ training staff to ensure he comes back as close to full strength as possible. He will stay back in the Bay Area and not travel with the Warriors on their upcoming road trip. Kuminga currently isn’t in a boot, but has to use crutches and can’t put much weight, if any at all, on his right ankle. “I would love to be back before the [three weeks], but I’m going to trust the process slowly,” Kuminga said. “I trust the guys behind the doors. They know what they’re doing. I’m going to listen to them and take it slowly until I heal right.” A three-week re-evaluation means Kuminga will miss at least 11 games. Between how well he has been playing and the upcoming Feb. 6 NBA trade deadline being a month away, when the injury occurred is frustrating for all parties. Kuminga, 22, averaged 21.0 points and 6.3 rebounds for the month of December. In 13 games for the month, Kuminga scored 20 or more points seven times, and had three games of at least 30 points. All aspects of the game, from the outside looking in, have slowed down for the former No. 7 overall draft pick. Kuminga credits a handful of people for empowering him to gain more trust and confidence in his fourth professional season. “Just the confidence and the trust coming from my teammates, coming from Steve [Kerr] himself,” Kuminga said. “A lot of talks with Steve. A lot of talks with [Warriors assistant coach Anthony Vereen], who I watch film with, just talking basketball and him telling me there’s another level that I still have to unlock that I didn’t even think about. “A lot of things just started clicking.” As the Warriors’ young player with the most upside, Kuminga’s name will be thrown around in trade rumors, just like they have been time and time again. Though that part of his future is out of his hands, Kuminga, who will be a restricted free agent this summer, says he’s comfortable in his place with the organization now and in the future. “I feel good. I feel good,” Kuminga said. “Like I’ve said before, you never know what’s going to happen, but I’m very confident where I’m at. I feel good about where I’m at with everything that’s going on.” Download and follow the Dubs Talk Podcast",0,[],2025-01-06 04:08:32,2025-01-06 04:08:32

This comes as some stations are charging a whopping $0.50 per kWh, compared to the average $0.09 per kWh to charge a Tesla at home. Since Tesla implemented the price reduction, one Supercharging station in Quebec showed the price dropped from $0.50 per kWh to $0.42 per kWh. Ideally, one would be able to charge their Tesla at home daily for a greatly reduced price, but Superchargers offer a convenient and efficient alternative when on a road trip or driving for an extended time. According to the Tesla website, there are over 60,000 Superchargers around the globe. And with the ability to get a 200-mile recharge in just 15 minutes, it's a fast, environmentally friendly, and cost-efficient alternative to traditional fossil fuel. Tesla head of charging Max de Zegher has stated on X, formerly known as Twitter, the company's goals for Supercharging pricing are twofold: ""1) Price low to accelerate EV adoption, we pass on cost efficiencies and 2) be financially sustainable to invest in the network, growing dependable freedom to travel."" Forbes notes EV registrations increasing by 40% between 2022 and 2023 — that's nearly one in every five cars purchased being electric. However, there are still multiple obstacles many potential consumers face like affordability and infrastructure accessibility. And while it's vital these barriers are addressed to make EVs more accessible, the benefits of electric vehicles cannot be overstated in regard to your wallet, your health, and the planet. As mentioned by the Natural Resources Defense Council, EVs are more reasonable to fuel, contribute to cleaner air, and produce no tailpipe pollution. With Tesla's latest move to reduce Supercharging prices, it's an emboldened step to encourage more EV adopters, as Max de Zegher suggested as one of their primary goals. One pragmatic commenter on Electrek's article states that, ""The Tesla charging network is still the best/most reliable, but, there are competitors cropping up everywhere, and the Tesla network isn't the only game in town. So...good for Elon/Tesla on this, but...the days of a monopoly are quickly ending."" It's a step in the right direction, but there's still a long way to go for Tesla and the EV market as a whole to reach the ""mass-market tipping point"", as the International Energy Agency states.

One common error is not placing a limit on your child's purchasing ability. That's easy to do and can often be done before your cruise or with a visit to guest services. If you don't limit what your child can spend, they may come back to the room with $25 worth of candy or run up a massive bill in the arcade. Arcades are a massive spending trap as you have to scan your room card, but the cost isn't listed, and charges pile up fast. Related: Royal Caribbean makes its new beverage policy very clear Another key area where people run up massive bills is with their smartphones.

Dan's note: On multiple occasions, I have had my phone on Airplane Mode and still come home to a large T-Mobile bill. Fortunately, in each case, the carrier worked with me to eliminate the charges. In one case, I made a long phone call from Mexico, which I thought was included in my plan. In reality, I could call Mexico from the United States, but not vice versa. Adding global calling was like a $10 charge, and T-Mobile dropped the original bill and retroactively charged me for the global add-on. In a second incident, I turned off Airplane Mode in Key West, Fla. — a U.S. port, and forgot to turn it back on until I got a text from T-Mobile the next morning. That night, while I was sleeping, I incurred over $100 in charges. T-Mobile dropped those too, after a phone call.

My question concerns ongoing conversations we have been having about my hair color. The first couple of years we were together, my hair was gray, and then I dyed it red. While I know he loved it, I did it for one reason: I wanted to avoid aging myself unnecessarily in the workplace. My husband knew this. Two years ago, now retired, I decided to stop coloring my hair. Since then, he continually mentions that he wants me to return to red hair. I have told him repeatedly that I’m unwilling to do that. He says he loved me so much when I was a redhead (does that mean he loves me less now?) and that my “going gray” has made HIM feel old. I am dismayed and annoyed by his continuing campaign to have me color my hair again, and I have said so. He even brings it up in front of our friends, which feels to me as though he’s trying to gather outside support for his argument. I LIKE my gray hair. It saddens me that my husband finds me less attractive or that my gray hair may be the reason he “feels old,” but I wonder why my hair color choice bears that burden of responsibility. Isn’t it rightfully my choice? I wouldn’t dream of directing him about how to wear his hair. Your thoughts? — SILVER GIRL IN NEW YORK DEAR GIRL: This shouldn’t be a power struggle, which it appears it has turned into. Yes, your hair color is your choice, and rightfully so. (Would wearing a red wig when your husband is feeling amorous be a workable compromise?) If he “feels old” when he sees gray hair, perhaps coloring his own hair would make him feel younger. DEAR ABBY: I have worked successfully in the creative arts most of my professional life. My problem? My spouse never misses an opportunity to denigrate my work. If I show an unusual inspiration or spark of creativity which I am proud of, they instantly find fault and say it’s not a good or valid idea. It’s crushing! This could destroy our long and happy marriage. It’s painful because I love my spouse in every way. I am always respectful and supportive of their professional work. — NO VALIDATION IN CALIFORNIA DEAR NO VALIDATION: Spouses are supposed to support each other. Is your spouse equally successful in their creative and work endeavors? If the answer is no, they may be jealous of, or threatened by, your success. They could also be insensitive about how their remarks affect you. Have you asked your spouse why they are trashing your work? If you have and the response was unsatisfactory, a way to deal with this may be to tell your spouse you prefer that from now on, they keep their opinion to themself, and quit looking to them for validation.

https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/ok-feed-wild-birds-tips-150643637.html,It’s OK to feed wild birds – here are some tips for doing it the right way,,Science,The Conversation,6 min read,"Millions of Americans feed wild birds, especially in winter and spring. Studies show that this can influence birds’ health and behavior in surprising ways.","Julian Avery, Penn State",2025-01-05T15:06:43.000Z,"Millions of Americans enjoy feeding and watching backyard birds. Many people make a point of putting food out in winter, when birds needs extra energy, and spring, when many species build nests and raise young. As a wildlife ecologist and a birder, I know it’s important to understand how humans influence bird populations, whether feeding poses risks to wild birds, and how to engage with birds in sustainable ways. There is still much to learn about the risks and benefits of feeding birds, particularly through large integrated national citizen science networks like Project FeederWatch. But we now have enough information to promote healthy interactions that can inspire future generations to care about conservation. Birds have been taking advantage of human civilization for thousands of years, congregating where grains and waste are abundant. This means that people have been influencing the abundance and distribution of species for a very long time. Studies show that providing food has myriad effects on birds’ decisions, behaviors and reproduction. One significant finding is that winter bird feeding increases individual survival rates, can encourage birds to lay eggs earlier in the year, and can also improve nestling survival. All of these factors alter species’ future reproductive performance and can increase total bird abundance in later years. It’s not always clear how increased abundance of feeder birds impacts other species through competition, but rarer and smaller species can be excluded. This interactive diagram, based on citizen science data, shows how North America’s top 13 feeder species fare when they compete at feeders. Credit: Cornell Lab of Ornithology Supplemental food has also led to reduced reproductive success in a few species. This may happen because it improves survival odds for less healthy birds that otherwise would be unlikely to survive and reproduce, or because it leads birds to eat fewer types of natural foods, making their diets less nourishing. Research also shows that birds are extremely promiscuous. One review examined 342 species and found that in approximately 75%, birds had one or more side partners in addition to their nest mate. It’s not always clear why birds cheat, but several studies have found that supplemental feeding can reduce the amount of infidelity in certain species, including house sparrows. This hints that feeding birds might alter their behavior and have an effect on genetic variation in urban populations. For birds that provide pollinating services, like hummingbirds and lorikeets, there is some evidence that providing them with sugar water – which mimics the nectar they collect from plants – can reduce their visits to native plants. This means they will transfer less pollen. Since much bird feeding happens in densely populated urban areas, it’s unclear how much impact this might have. Some bird populations depend completely on feeding and would collapse over the winter without it. For example, Anna’s hummingbirds in British Columbia rely on heated feeders. Other species, such as hummingbirds in the southwest U.S., have become more locally abundant. Northern cardinals and American goldfinches have shifted and expanded their ranges northward with the availability of food. In one incredible instance, garden feeders seem to have played a role in establishing a new wintering population of migratory blackcaps in the United Kingdom. This group is now genetically distinct from the rest of the population, which migrates further south to Mediterranean wintering grounds. Scientists still know little about how bird feeding affects transmission of pathogens and parasites among birds. It is not uncommon for birds at feeders to carry more pathogens than populations away from feeders. Some well-documented outbreaks in the U.S. and U.K. have shown that feeding birds can increase problems associated with disease – evidence that was collected through feeder watch citizen science projects. Because we still have a poor understanding of pathogen transmission and prevalence in urban areas, it is extremely important to follow hygiene guidelines for feeding and be alert for new recommendations. Feeding can also attract predators. Domestic cats kill an estimated 1.3 to 4 billion birds in the U.S. every year. Feeders should not be placed in settings where cats are present, and pet cats should be kept indoors. Feeders can also support both native and introduced birds that outcompete local species. One study found that feeders attracted high numbers of crows, which prey on other birds’ chicks, with the result that less than 1% of nearby American robin nests fledged young. In New Zealand, bird feeding largely benefits seed-eating introduced species at the expense of native birds. The good news is that studies do not show birds becoming dependent on supplemental food. Once started, though, it is important to maintain a steady food supply during harsh weather. Birds also need access to native plants, which provide them with habitat, food and insect prey that can both supplement diets and support species that don’t eat seeds at feeders. Diverse food resources can counteract some of the negative findings I’ve mentioned related to competition between species and impacts on bird diets. Good maintenance, placement and cleaning can help minimize the likelihood of promoting pathogens at feeders. Initiatives like Project FeederWatch have recommendations about feeder design and practices to avoid. For example, platform feeders, where birds wade through the food, are associated with higher mortality, possibly through mixing of waste and food. It’s also important to manage the area around feeders. Be sure to place feeders in ways that minimize the likelihood that birds will fly into windows. For instance, avoid providing a sight line through a house, which birds may perceive as a corridor, and break up window reflections with decals. There are lots of great reasons to bring birds into your life. Evidence is growing that interacting with nature is good for our mental health and builds public support for conserving plants and wildlife. In my view, these benefits outweigh many of the potential negatives of bird feeding. And if you get involved in a citizen science project, you can help scientists track the health and behavior of your wild guests.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/carbon-offsets-help-bring-energy-150332350.html,Carbon offsets can help bring energy efficiency to low-income Americans − our Nashville data shows it could be a win for everyone,,US,The Conversation,6 min read,"Insulating attics, replacing windows and adding heat pumps can save money and reduce emissions − if residents can afford the upgrades. Carbon-offset purchases by local companies could help.","Zdravka Tzankova, Vanderbilt University; Carol Ziegler, Vanderbilt University, and James Muchira, Vanderbilt University",2025-01-05T15:03:32.000Z,"Under pressure from customers and investors, many U.S. companies have pledged to voluntarily reduce their impact on the climate. But that doesn’t always mean they’re cutting their own greenhouse gas emissions. A large number of companies are instead paying others to reduce carbon emissions on their behalf through projects that generate carbon offsets. There are reasons for skepticism about this practice. Chief among them is that projects developed for carbon offsets have a history of taking up land in poorer countries, displacing small-scale farmers and threatening livelihoods in the process. The quality of some globally traded voluntary offsets has also proven challenging to verify. Investigations of forest-offset projects, for example, have suggested that many aren’t as effective at sequestering carbon as they claim. We think there is a better solution: Companies could spend some of their carbon-offset money on climate-friendly projects that don’t just cut emissions but also improve people’s lives in the U.S. communities where these companies operate. Our team at the Climate, Health and Energy Equity Lab at Vanderbilt University has been exploring the possibility of corporate offset dollars paying to improve energy efficiency in low-income housing, starting with a pilot study in our hometown of Nashville. Efficiency upgrades can save energy and money and reduce carbon emissions. At the same time, they reduce some of the many health risks created or elevated by living in a home that is hard to properly heat and cool. Such upgrades can be financed by selling carbon offsets on the “social carbon” segment of the voluntary carbon market. The combined economic, health and climate benefits of low-income energy upgrades could make these projects attractive for companies seeking to fulfill their climate commitments and earn positive attention in the local community. On average, low-income households in the U.S. spend 6% to 10% of their income on energy costs. Often, these renters and homeowners are struggling to keep aging, poorly insulated homes at healthy temperatures. For some people, the cost of heating a home can get so high it becomes a choice of “heat or eat,” which can take a physical and mental health toll. In Nashville, we looked at implementing four key types of energy efficiency upgrades in low-income housing. Together, they can reduce energy use and energy-related carbon emissions while also earning offset credits on the voluntary carbon market. We calculated that the combination of upgrading the windows, refrigerator and heating and cooling system and also insulating the attic in a two-bedroom Nashville rental unit could reduce its carbon emissions from home energy use by an estimated 592 tons over the 25-year life of the upgrades. If carbon reductions from upgrades to that Nashville home were packaged as carbon offsets and sold on the voluntary carbon market at US$30 to $45 per ton, the money earned could cover the substantial material costs for the energy efficiency upgrades. This pricing is consistent with prices commanded by other carbon offsets with significant and meaningful social benefits. It is also quite possible that the community health benefits would be more attractive to some corporate buyers than the carbon reductions themselves. The offset transactions can be facilitated by nonprofits, social enterprises or local governments. Many of these upgrades are prohibitively expensive for low-income households without outside financial help. They also tend to be avoided by landlords, since it is tenants, not landlords, who pay the utility bills. Projects are already mobilizing carbon-offset funding for renewable energy and energy efficiency in the U.S. One of the early innovators was the Maine State Housing Authority. The agency piloted financing residential energy efficiency upgrades with the sale of carbon offsets in the early 2000s and discovered how complicated the process can be. Chevrolet’s $750,000 purchase of carbon credits from the Maine project in 2012 enabled efficiency upgrades to about 170 homes. The project revealed some important lessons, including the need for a large number of homes and a high carbon price for the project to pay off. A 2012 review of the program noted that, while each house could generate hundreds of dollars in carbon credits, setting up the project, measuring and validating the value, and selling this type of offset can cost tens of thousands of dollars before the work on homes begins. To lower that cost, Maya Maciel-Seidman, a member of our team, developed a way to quantify carbon reductions from home energy upgrades. She was able to reduce the time and cost by relying on publicly available utility and government data combined with easy to perform on-the-ground measurements. Another challenge this type of carbon offset – and offsets that support clean energy geneartion – can run into is the question of additionality: Would low-income energy upgrades happen anyway, without funding from carbon offsets? We don’t think so. There are federal programs that provide funding for energy efficiency upgrades in low-income housing. However, the 40-plus-year track record of the federal Weatherization Assistance Program and Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program suggests the vast majority of eligible low-income households aren’t reached by these programs. A solar startup in the U.S. Southeast offers another example of carbon offsets with environmental and economic co-benefits close to home. Clearloop generates carbon offsets by building utility-scale solar farms in the dirtiest parts of the U.S. electric grid, regions with little renewable energy and highly polluting power plants. The company finances solar developments through the up-front sale of carbon offsets representing the emissions saved during the lifetime operation of each solar farm. Using carbon offsets isn’t a substitute for reducing emissions, or for public policies and funding aimed at eradicating energy poverty and insecurity. But we believe that mobilizing the voluntary carbon market to finance energy efficiency upgrades in low-income homes could offer meaningful relief to many households. The physical proximity to corporate supporters of such projects should also allow for greater transparency and accountability. When companies purchase carbon offsets that are locally generated and bring additional benefits to their host communities, they bolster their social license to operate while making progress toward meeting climate commitments.

New Glenn could lift off as early as next week.","Jackie Wattles, CNN",2025-01-04T19:45:27.000Z,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. On a Florida launchpad that has been dormant for almost two decades, a new, roughly 320-foot (98-meter) rocket — developed by Jeff Bezos’ company Blue Origin — is poised for its maiden flight. The uncrewed launch vehicle, called New Glenn, will mark Blue Origin’s first attempt to send a rocket to orbit, a feat necessary if the company hopes to chip away at SpaceX’s long-held dominance in the industry. New Glenn is set to lift off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station as early as next week. The rocket, which stands about as tall as a 30-story building, consists of several parts: The first-stage rocket booster gives the initial thrust at liftoff. Atop the booster is an upper rocket stage that includes a cargo bay protected by a nose cone that will house experimental technology for this mission. And, in an attempt to replicate the success that SpaceX has found reusing rocket boosters over the past decade, Blue Origin will also aim to guide New Glenn’s first-stage rocket booster back to a safe landing on a seafaring platform — named Jacklyn for Bezos’ mother — minutes after takeoff. Like SpaceX, Blue Origin will seek to recover, refurbish and reuse first-stage rocket boosters to drive down costs. For this inaugural mission, a smooth flight is not guaranteed. But the eventual success of New Glenn, named after storied NASA astronaut John Glenn, is instrumental to some of Blue Origin’s most ambitious goals. The rocket could one day power national security launches, haul Amazon internet satellites to space and even help in the construction of a space station that Blue Origin is developing with commercial partners. Blue Origin formally announced the development of New Glenn — which aims to outpower SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rockets and haul spacecraft up to 45 metric tons (99,200 pounds) to orbit — in 2016. The vehicle is long overdue, as the company previously targeted 2020 for its first launch. Delays, however, are common in the aerospace industry. And the debut flight of a new vehicle is almost always significantly behind schedule. Rocket companies also typically take a conservative approach to the first liftoff, launching dummy payloads such as hunks of metal or, as was the case with SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy debut in 2018, an old cherry red sports car. Blue Origin has also branded itself as a company that aims to take a slow, diligent approach to rocket development that doesn’t “cut any corners,” according to Bezos, who founded Blue Origin and funds the company. The company’s mascot is a tortoise, paying homage to “The Tortoise and the Hare” fable that made the “slow and steady wins the race” mantra a childhood staple. “We believe slow is smooth and smooth is fast,” Bezos said in 2016. Those comments could be seen as an attempt to position Blue Origin as the anti-SpaceX, which is known to embrace speed and trial-and-error over slow, meticulous development processes. But SpaceX has certainly won the race to orbit. The company’s first orbital rocket, the Falcon 1, made a successful launch in September 2008. The company has deployed hundreds of missions to orbit since then. And while SpaceX routinely destroys rockets during test flights as it begins developing a new rocket, the company has a solid track record for operational missions. SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket, for example, has experienced two in-flight failures and one launchpad explosion but no catastrophic events during human missions. So far, Blue Origin has been known mostly for its space tourism efforts, launching paying customers and celebrities on New Shepard — a much smaller, suborbital rocket that is not powerful enough to send satellites to space. Of the more than 20 flights New Shepard has conducted so far, the vehicle has experienced one failure during an uncrewed science mission. While SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk and Bezos have been known to spar and bluster publicly about their rocket companies, Musk’s input on New Glenn’s debut so far has been positive: “Godspeed!” he posted on his social media platform X on December 27. In some ways, New Glenn has already made its mark on the launch industry. Blue Origin has for years pitched the rocket to compete with both SpaceX and United Launch Alliance — a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin that buys engines from Blue Origin — for lucrative military launch contracts. The US Space Force selected Blue Origin, ULA and SpaceX in June to compete for $5.6 billion worth of Pentagon contracts for national security missions slated to launch over the next four years. Blue Origin also has deals with several commercial companies to launch satellites. The contracts include plans to help deploy Amazon’s Kuiper internet satellites and a recently inked deal with AST SpaceMobile to help launch the Midland, Texas-based company’s space-based cellular broadband network. New Glenn could also be instrumental in building Blue Origin’s planned space station, called Orbital Reef. Blue Origin and it commercial partners, including Sierra Space and Boeing, among others, hope the station will one day provide a new destination for astronauts as the International Space Station is phased out of service. New Glenn packs significant power. Dubbed a “heavy-lift” vehicle, its capabilities lie between SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket and the more powerful Falcon Heavy launch vehicle. SpaceX’s workhorse Falcon 9, for example, can haul up to 22.8 metric tons (50,265 pounds) to space. While New Glenn is capable of carrying about double that mass, it may also be roughly the same price as a Falcon 9: reportedly around $60 million to $70 million per launch. “I think in order to compete with Falcon 9, you have to go head-to-head or better on price,” said Caleb Henry, the director of research at Quilty Space, which provides data and analysis about the space sector. The question, however, is whether Blue Origin will be able to sustain a competitive price point, Henry added. Still, one feature that makes New Glenn stand out is its large payload fairing, or nose cone. The component protects the cargo bay and is a whopping 23 feet (7 meters) wide — nearly 6 feet (2 meters) larger than that of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 or Falcon Heavy. Henry said Blue Origin likely opted to outfit New Glenn with such a large fairing in order to help fulfill Bezos’ vision of the future. The tech billionaire has long described a desire to one day move manufacturing and other polluting, “heavy” industries off Earth, leaving our home planet as a sort of national park for humans to visit and enjoy. And to do that, he would need rockets that can carry huge objects. Though New Glenn outpowers the Falcon 9, SpaceX is in the process of developing the groundbreaking flagship of its rocket arsenal. Like Bezos, SpaceX’s Musk has his own concept of our future in space, with humans living and working on other planets, particularly Mars. To help realize that vision, SpaceX is developing Starship, the largest and most powerful launch vehicle ever constructed. The nearly 400-foot-tall (121-meter) rocket dwarfs New Glenn in every sense: Musk has said he hopes Starship will haul up to 300 tons to orbit. SpaceX has billed Starship as a rocket that could make all others obsolete because it aims to drastically reduce the price per kilogram of getting cargo (or people) to space. Whether that will actually happen remains to be seen, Henry noted. “But I think that if SpaceX continues to lower the cost of access to space, they’ll always be the No. 1 competitor,” Henry said. Blue Origin had planned to launch a pair of Mars-bound satellites on behalf of NASA for the first flight of New Glenn. But delays with the rocket’s development prompted the space agency to change course, moving that flight to this spring at the earliest. So for this inaugural flight, Blue Origin opted to instead fly a “demonstrator” that will test technology needed for the company’s proposed Blue Ring spacecraft — which will aim to serve as a sort of in-space rideshare vehicle, dragging satellites deeper into space when needed. The demonstrator on this New Glenn flight will remain aboard the rocket for the entire six-hour flight, Blue Origin said, and it will validate “communications capabilities from orbit to ground” as well as “test its in-space telemetry, tracking and command hardware, and ground-based radiometric tracking.” The Blue Ring Pathfinder demonstrator is part of a deal Blue Origin inked with the US Department of Defense’s Defense Innovation Unit. Similar to SpaceX, Blue Origin is aiming to recover and refly its first-stage rocket boosters in a bid to make launches less expensive. “Reusability is integral to radically reducing cost-per-launch,” the company said in a recent news release, using the same oft-repeated sentiment that SpaceX has touted since it began landing rocket boosters in 2015. Bezos, however, has acknowledged the importance of reusing rocket parts since he founded the company in 2000 — two years before Musk established SpaceX. And the company has already developed its suborbital New Shepard tourism rocket to be reusable. “It’s not a copy cat game,” Henry said. “Blue Origin has been pursuing reusable vehicles since before reusable vehicles were cool. Now it’s much more of a mainstream idea (because of SpaceX). The difference is that it’s taken Blue Origin so much longer to get to orbit.” If successful, returning the New Glenn rocket booster for a safe landing will be a stunning feat. After expending most of its fuel to propel the rocket’s upper stage to space, the first-stage booster will need to make a clean separation. The booster must then maneuver with pinpoint guidance and reignite its engines with precision timing to avoid crashing into the ocean or the Jacklyn recovery platform.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Exploring space has opened our eyes to numerous wonders, but these cosmic feats haven’t come without challenges. Each SpaceX Starship launch from South Texas creates a stunning spectacle, previewing maneuvers that could one day be used to carry humans to Mars. But the most powerful rocket ever built also unleashes an earsplitting sonic boom when its Super Heavy rocket booster returns for a landing. Now, with more launches on the horizon, new research suggests the noise could spell trouble, including environmental risks and potential hearing damage. Meanwhile, a massive fragment of a space object crashed to Earth in a remote village of Kenya. The space debris is just one of several pieces that have plummeted back to the planet. However, experts are more worried about the growing number of objects circling our world. Tens of thousands of identifiable pieces of space junk orbit Earth, along with potentially millions more that can’t be seen or tracked. These stray objects pose a risk to astronauts, satellites, and other space-based technologies that we rely on for internet and other services. “The number of objects in space that we have launched in the last four years has increased exponentially,” said Dr. Vishnu Reddy, a professor of planetary sciences at the University of Arizona in Tucson. “So we are heading towards the situation that we are always dreading.” The scenario, in which space debris collides and creates more debris, is called Kessler Syndrome. Eventually, the proliferation could make Earth’s orbit too clogged for satellites to orbit — or for space missions to launch. While we may not be in dire straits yet, space traffic needs to be addressed sooner rather than later, experts say. Scientists studying comb jellies, one of the oldest animals on Earth, discovered that individuals have the ability to fuse their bodies, as well as the nervous and digestive systems, to become one organism. Injured comb jellies could fuse and move as a unit, the biologists found. Time-lapse imaging of the fusion process showed just how quickly the jellies were able to synchronize their muscle movements and effectively become one. This pairing, resulting in a single animal with multiple sensory organs, may be a survival mechanism, the researchers believe. Researchers have finally pinpointed the location of a “mystery volcano” that erupted so violently it cooled Earth’s climate in 1831. The eruption, the most powerful of the 19th century, lofted so much sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere that the annual average temperatures for the Northern Hemisphere dropped by about 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit). An in-depth study of ice cores taken from Greenland enabled researchers to look back across time and isolate volcanic glass shards deposited nearly 200 years ago. Analyzing and mapping the likely trajectory of the particles helped scientists zero in on the Zavaritskii volcano on the remote and uninhabited Simushir Island, part of the Kuril Islands archipelago disputed by Russia and Japan. A devastating heat wave caused the worst single-species mortality event documented in modern history, and the birds affected by the disaster aren’t bouncing back, according to a recent study. The marine heat wave, known as “the Blob,” stretched across the ocean from California to the Gulf of Alaska between 2014 and 2016. The spike in temperatures killed about 4 million common murres in Alaska, which represents half of the state’s population of those seabirds. The birds play a critical role as predators in the marine food web. “There are about 8 million people in New York City, so it would be like losing half of the population … in a single winter,” said Brie Drummond, a wildlife biologist at the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. A tiny seahorse relative, an adventurous moth and a vegetarian piranha named after a “Lord of the Rings” villain are just a few of the hundreds of previously unknown species announced by scientists in 2024. Scientific divers had one chance to explore South African reefs, where they spotted a pygmy pipehorse. The golf tee-size species was found camouflaged near some sponges, expanding the creature’s known range from the waters of New Zealand’s North Island to the Indian Ocean. Meanwhile, a moth found its way into the boot of a photographer, who accidently transported the insect from South America to her home in Wales. Her daughter, ecologist Daisy Cadet, spied the unusual moth as it fluttered around the house and reached out to London’s Natural History Museum.

Here's how to listen in,,Science,Space,4 min read,NASA's beleaguered Mars Sample Return program currently faces extreme costs of up to $11 billion and a timeline that could reach 2040.,Tariq Malik,2025-01-04T13:00:00.000Z,"When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission. The year 2025 isn't even a week old and NASA is already gearing up for its first big announcement, this one about the agency's ambitious, yet beleaguered, Mars sample return mission. On Tuesday (Jan. 7), NASA's top brass will hold an audio-only press conference to update the public on its Mars sample return program. The media briefing will begin at 1:00 p.m. EST (1800 GMT), and you'll be able to listen in online via NASA's website. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson and Nicky Fox, the agency's associate administrator for science missions, will host the Mars exploration briefing. ""The briefing will include NASA's efforts to complete its goals of returning scientifically selected samples from Mars to Earth while lowering cost, risk and mission complexity,"" NASA officials wrote in a Jan. 3 statement. NASA's Mars Sample Return program is designed to do just what its name suggests: return pieces of Mars to Earth so scientists can study the Red Planet up close. To that end, NASA's Perseverance rover on Mars has already collected and cached a bevy of samples since it arrived on the planet in 2021. ""The agency's Mars Sample Return Program has been a major long-term goal of international planetary exploration for more than two decades,"" NASA wrote in the statement. ""NASA's Perseverance rover is collecting compelling science samples that will help scientists understand the geological history of Mars, the evolution of its climate, and prepare for future human explorers. The return of the samples also will help NASA's search for signs of ancient life."" But the mission to return those Perseverance Mars rover samples to Earth is at a crossroads. One plan to return Perseverance's samples to Earth called for a lander to touch down near the rover, use a sophisticated robotic arm (or perhaps robotic drones like NASA's Ingenuity Mars helictoper) to collect the samples from Perserverance and store them in a rocket that would then launch into orbit. Another spacecraft, provided by the European Space Agency, would then collect the sample capsule for the trip to Earth. In 2020, the estimated cost of that Mars sample return plan maxed out at around $3 billion. By April 2024, the mission's complexity and technical challenges were clearer, and its price tag rose to an estimated $11 billion at its high end. An assessment in September 2023 also found more bad news: Because of the complicated architecture of the plan, NASA would likely not be able to return Perseverance's samples to Earth until 2040, a full 20 years after the rover first launched to Mars. RELATED STORIES: — NASA wants new ideas for its troubled Mars Sample Return mission — Perseverance rover's Mars samples must be brought back to Earth, scientists stress — China moves Mars sample-return launch up 2 years, to 2028 ""The bottom line is that $11 billion is too expensive, and not returning samples until 2040 is unacceptably too long,"" Nelson said of that finding during an April 2024 media call. China, for example, plans to launch its own sample return mission to Mars in 2028 with the goal of returning those samples to Earth in 2031. So, NASA isn't alone in its race to collect samples of Mars. Throughout 2024, NASA has worked to revamp its Mars sample return plan into a scenario that would reduce its cost and complexity. Tuesday's media briefing may reveal some of the new thinking that could go into that plan. Last month, Nelson told reporters at NASA's Kennedy Space Center that the new Mars sample return plan will include more than just NASA centers. ""What’s coming out is by involving industry, and not NASA centers like [the Jet Propulsion Laboratory], combining with others, they're coming out with much more practical (proposals), where they can speed up the time and considerably lower the cost,"" Spaceflight Now quoted Nelson as saying during the Dec. 18 meeting.",14,[],2025-01-06 04:10:13,2025-01-06 22:43:29
https://www.yahoo.com/news/small-satellite-constellation-could-reveal-130000247.html,Small satellite constellation could reveal black holes like never before,,Science,Space,4 min read,A constellation of small satellites could help researchers view processes in close vicinity of supermassive black holes like never before.,Tereza Pultarova,2025-01-04T13:00:00.000Z,"When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission. Researchers in South Korea are developing a constellation of satellites that could reveal what goes on in the vicinity of supermassive black holes like never before. The constellation, dubbed Capella, is a brainchild of Seoul National University astronomy professor Sascha Trippe. An expert in black holes, Trippe has grown frustrated with the limitations of humanity's existing instruments for observing black holes and concerned that unless major technological advances are made, research may soon reach a ""dead end."" When the first-ever image of a supermassive black hole — the one at the center of the Messier 87 galaxy some 55 million light-years away from Earth — was revealed to the world in 2019, it caused a sensation. It showed a glowing ring the shape of a donut, enclosing an eerie dark spot. It confirmed that black holes, these mind-boggling hotspots of gravity so potent that not even light can escape from them, indeed exist. In 2022, an image of the black hole at the center of our own galaxy, the Milky Way, followed. As captivating as the images were, for researchers like Trippe, they were nowhere near perfect. These imperfections are a result of the limitations of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), a planet-wide network of radio telescopes that acts like a single planet-wide observatory thanks to a technique known as very long baseline interferometry. ""The problem is that at any given point in time, each pair of antennas [of EHT] only measures one point of the target image,"" Trippe told Space.com. ""You end up with an image that is mostly empty and requires a lot of processing. For that reason, we miss a lot of structure, because features under a certain size simply cannot be imaged."" For example, astronomers know that a powerful jet of hot gas blasts from the Messier 87 black hole at the speed of light. This jet, however, cannot be seen in the famous 2019 image. One way to improve the resolution of black hole images is to measure emissions of radio signals that have higher frequencies and thus shorter wavelengths. But that is impossible from the surface of our planet because water vapor present in Earth's atmosphere mostly absorbs this signal. Radio telescopes on satellites would have an unobstructed view of this kind of radiation. They would also solve two additional problems. The Capella satellite constellation envisioned by Trippe and his colleagues would consist of four satellites orbiting at altitudes between 280 and 370 miles (450 and 600 kilometers). No longer restricted by the perimeter of the planet, the orbiting radio-telescope network — through the interferometry technique — would have a larger diameter than the planet-wide EHT, therefore providing better image quality and better resolution. As the satellites move around the planet, circling it multiple times per day, their measurements leave no empty spots, unlike the sparse network of Earth-based EHT telescopes. Trippe says the system would open a completely new window into the processes taking place in the vicinity of the black holes' event horizons, the boundaries from beyond which nothing escapes. ""We would really like to understand how the relativistic jets are formed from the gas accreted by the black hole,"" Trippe said. ""But it requires observations in resolutions that are currently impossible and could only be handled by a space-based radio interferometer like the Capella constellation."" The orbiting black-hole watching system could image black holes in nearby galaxies at a much faster rate than the Earth-bound EHT and provide more accurate estimates of their masses. It would also help researchers understand the processes that take place inside the glowing rings that surround those black holes, according to Trippe. Scientists have so far not attempted to place many radio telescopes into orbit. Due to the long wavelengths of the radio signals, the receiving antennas must be quite large and are therefore not easily launched into space or deployed. But with advances in technology, Trippe thinks a modest radio observatory could now fit into a 1100-pound (500-kilogram) satellite bus. RELATED STORIES: — The top 7 black hole discoveries from 2024 — Black holes can squash star formation, James Webb Space Telescope finds — Supermassive black holes prefer to eat from wobbly plates ""Technology is just becoming available now so that we can actually build these systems sufficiently small and sufficiently cheap,"" said Trippe. He envisions the whole system to cost no more than $500 million. South Korea's recently formed Korea Aerospace Administration has expressed interest in the project, Trippe said, and will decide next year about providing funding. If all goes well, scientists might be able to shed more light on the insatiable monsters at galactic centers as soon as early 2030s. Trippe and his team presented the concept in paper published on arXiv.",2,[],2025-01-06 04:10:13,2025-01-06 21:12:04
https://www.yahoo.com/news/learned-black-hole-los-angeles-110120906.html,What I learned from a black hole in Los Angeles,,Entertainment,Space,10 min read,PST: Art and Science Collide exhibits are on view across Los Angeles.,Monisha Ravisetti,2025-01-04T11:01:20.000Z,"When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission. On York Boulevard in Los Angeles, a blurred black hole hangs on a dark wall, joined only by a pair of headphones playing looping echoes of its siblings colliding. It's a familiar scene of our galaxy's supermassive central void, and certainly one that has flown far and wide over the years. I'd bet you've seen it. Journalists (including myself) have fawned over this image, affixing it to exhilarating news stories under titles like ""First Image of Milky Way's Black Hole"" or ""Center of Our Galaxy Revealed."" Universities have thrown it onto press releases about the Earth-spanning array of radio telescopes it owes itself to, and scientists have published it in heady studies while endearingly calling its subject just what it looks like: a fuzzy orange doughnut. However, at the OXY ARTS gallery in Los Angeles, that abstruse portrait of Sagittarius A* looks a little different. Isolated on its assigned wall, the 4.3-million-solar-mass black hole takes up space outside its usual astrophysical boundaries, both in the cosmos and in academia, to open itself up to artistic criticism and reflection. I have to admit, when I first saw it, my initial feeling was that it's curious to exhibit an unedited scientific image of the cosmos in an art gallery, and especially one that artists featured across the gallery didn't have a hand in creating. It seemed hollow, and even slightly ostentatious. But, after some time, I softened. The intentionally empty area around Sgr A*'s frame seemed to actually punctuate its conceptual and visual weight in a way its typical online backdrop of search bars and Google Chrome tabs never has for me. The piece itself wasn't groundbreaking in my opinion, but the choice to put it up on a gallery wall at all might have been. This made me start to wonder whether wavelengths of art and science tend to constructively or destructively interfere with one another, or whether they are really the same to begin with. For example, something that is extremely intrinsic to art, but not to science, is the idea of individuality. A true work of art is often considered irreplicable, but an ideal scientific conclusion relies on replicability to prove itself as a universal truth. Though, on the other hand, one of the most well-known examples of someone who sang the song of art and science is Leonardo Da Vinci, whose masterpieces are specifically built on principles of anatomy, physics and mathematics. Would it be fair to ask which of the two disciplines came first for Da Vinci? Which was bubbling in his mind to begin with, reaching out to call for the other? To be fair, I don't know whether I was wringing water from a stone with this thought. But even if I was, I think there's something interesting about that, too. French painter Marcel Duchamp once said in his 1957 talk about artistic criticism that ""the creative act is not performed by the artist alone; the spectator brings the work in contact with the external world by deciphering and interpreting its inner qualifications and thus adds his contribution to the creative act."" This becomes more relevant when we think about why I was looking at this Sgr A* exhibit in the first place. For six days in September of last year, The Getty Museum's PST: Art and Science Collide event invited me to travel to about 30 galleries across Los Angeles and absorb the results of a challenge they gave various artists and art curators: to create exhibits that tiptoe the line separating art and science. In a sea of art journalists, I was one of the only science news representatives — if not the only one — meticulously searching canvases and sculptures for traces of contemporary discoveries and fundamental theories I'm so used to reading in black and white. In other words, I arrived on this trip as an outsider. Almost immediately, on day one, my status as a non-art-journalist became quite clear, and truthfully, enhanced the imposter syndrome I typically feel no matter the occasion. I didn't have the background knowledge of my peers when talking about up-and-coming artists, I didn't know the precise dynamics of art gallery bureaucracies and, more than once, I had to awkwardly ask one of my new friends how prolific the person I just talked to was. I simply didn't have the expertise necessary to comfortably judge art in an objective way, and in fact find the entire concept of artistic criticism a really complex one that's hard to penetrate. But what I did have was my knowledge of science. Thus, I dutifully hunted for threads of equations in the art we saw — even if only to have something to hold on to. I treated it like a scientific conference, and this is where I started thinking about Duchamp's ideas. Duchamp wondered about an elusive phenomenon in which a spectator reacts to a piece of work despite the artist technically having no part in that reaction. ""This phenomenon is comparable to a transference from the artist to the spectator in the form of an esthetic osmosis taking place through the inert matter, such as pigment, piano or marble,"" he says, and I think the transference greatly depends on the mental pathways one is already predisposed to taking. The concept reminds me of a scene from the TV show ""Mad Men"" in which someone buys an incredibly expensive piece of art but doesn't allow anyone in the workplace to see it. At last, a few characters manage to catch a glimpse, finding it to be no more than an annoyingly plain canvas with abstract red splotches. They immediately start reacting because they expected something more conventionally beautiful. But then, one of them, Ken, reflects that maybe reaction itself is the point. ""When you look at it, you feel something,"" he states. Alas, without existing in the room, the artist managed to provoke emotion and spur a conversation about aesthetics. With these scientific art exhibits, it seemed like the artwork inherently required both artistic and scientific spectators' reactions to bring the pieces toward their true potential. One exhibit took place in Doug Aitken's industrial art studio, where strings of light ricocheted across the wall as a film played on the artist's projector, depicting evocative dancers in an Amazon factory, drivers in the countryside and a myriad other human experiences. It made me wonder whether quantum entanglement had anything to do with the piece, seeing as photons are quantum particles and entanglement involves these particles being connected despite existing in separate locations. It's even possible if the particles are on opposite sides of the universe, like Amazon workers in delivery trucks and billionaires on private jets. However, someone else I met at the exhibition, who writes about dance, wasn't thinking about quantum mechanics. He pointed out the intricacies of the dancers' movements, and others across the room seemed to be paying close attention to Aitken's musical decisions and film direction. At the Hammer Museum, walking into a small veiled room brought you to a large glass box within which live bees build honeycomb patterns on top of sculptures that coax those patterns into works of art. I and three others watched as a bee flew to the bottom of the container and carried one of its dead brethren to the top, where there is a tunnel to the outside world. In another room of this museum, a dynamic black hole exists inside a space that comes with a warning about epilepsy. We don't know what black holes look like to the unaided eye, but I started pondering out loud whether they'd need an epilepsy warning for those who can circumvent getting stretched into noodle-like strips when faced with the void's gravitational pull — to the horror of a writer I met who was trying to capture the exhibit's striking colors on his phone because those colors fluctuated in peculiar ways on his mobile camera. Nearby, you could sit on the floor and listen to the simulated sounds of the wilderness, while watching a video of the real wilderness, in front of a simulated pond with simulated ripples. I stayed there for a while, reminiscing about how this might be a window into our future once unchecked climate change ravages our world. Artwork at the SCI-ARC gallery, under the title ""Views of Planet City"" uses real satellite images and futuristic video game formats to imagine a hypothetical world in which humanity lives in a single city to allow the rest of the planet to heal. This brought me to tears in a way detached news about record temperatures didn't, and I noticed a few others having a similar reaction. At the Brand Library and Art Museum, stalks of grass connected to mechanical blocks on the ground moved according to Martian wind patterns recorded by NASA's Perseverance rover on Mars. The movements were choppy not because the wind is jagged on Mars but because there are gaps in our data represented by gaps in the sway of the grass. Outside, a wall was decorated with bright yellow tape in a chevron pattern, tape that NASA uses to wrap instruments that blast off to locales far beyond Earth. On another wall, there was a microchip containing millions of people's names. It has since been sent on a journey to Jupiter's moon Europa. In his talk, Duchamp considered the two poles of the creation of art to be ""the artist on one hand, and on the other the spectator who later becomes the posterity,"" giving essentially equal weight to both the creator and the one who witnesses the creation and carves its legacy. Seeing or feeling artwork can be thought of as part of the artwork itself, in a sense; this becomes complex when considering how many different people, from different generations and with different perspectives, will act as spectators.

Vote now,,Celebrity,Yahoo Canada Style,6 min read,The Golden Globes red carpet was full of fashion hits and misses. We need your help to declare a winner — and a loser.,Elizabeth Di Filippo·Lifestyle & Features Editor,2025-01-06T04:07:49.000Z,"The 2025 Golden Globes red carpet was a feast for the eyes. The biggest names in Hollywood descended upon the Beverly Hills Hotel in Beverly Hills, Calif. to celebrate standout achievements in film and television, with comedian Nikki Glaser serving as host. While not everyone could go home with a golden statue, A-list celebrities were vying for the title of best dressed. We combed through every look from the red carpet and have narrowed down our picks for best — and worst — dressed at this year's awards. Now, we're putting it to a vote and want Yahoo Canada readers to weigh in. Scroll down below to cast your vote and dub the best and worst dressed star from the 2025 Golden Globe Awards! We'll share the winner (and loser) tomorrow. Kidman is Hollywood royalty and brings an otherworldly presence to the screen and the red carpet. The Babygirl star looked like a sparkling goddess in a one-shoulder Grecian-inspired custom gown by Balenciaga, paired with statement-making sapphire and diamond earrings. While Kidman's look from Balenciaga hit a fashion high-note, Wong's offering from the brand was a major miss. According to fashion correspondent Zanna Rassi, the tulle pieces of the avant-garde look had to be curled with a curling iron before the comedian hit the red carpet. While we appreciate the commitment to the look, we'd rather this Elmo-inspired ensemble make the trek back to Sesame Street. Anderson is in her movie star era. The actress ditched the glitz and glam of her character in The Last Showgirl in favour of a classic black gown reminiscent of old Hollywood icons. Melissa McCarthy is undoubtedly one of the funniest people in Hollywood. While we love to laugh with her, we don't necessarily want to be laughing at her — or her clothes. This custom Christian Siriano look was an odd choice for the Golden Globes, specifically the elaborate ruffled cape that was so large, it reportedly took 15 minutes for the actress to get into the car. Demi Moore looked regal in a champagne gown by Armani Privé with Swarovski crystals as she took home the Golden Globe for her performance in The Substance. With the help of her friend and stylist Brad Goreski, Moore's run of red carpet looks while promoting her hit film has been flawless, and the accolades for her performance — and red carpet impact. A controversial pick, but we've seen what Ariana Grande can do on the red carpet — and this isn't her best. The Wicked star dipped into the Givenchy archives to wear a 1966 butter yellow gown with ornate detailing that overwhelmed her petite frame. If you're going to win your first Golden Globe, this is the dress you want to be wearing! The actress star took home the award for her performance in the musical Emilia Pérez wearing a stunning sequin gown by Saint Laurent, topped off with sparkling Cartier diamonds. It's hard for Klum to look bad on a red carpet. The model and TV host is stunning, but this dress by Sophie Couture and particularly this shade of green pulls all of the focus. If only it were a different colour and perhaps had one less under-boob cut-out, it could have been a fashion hit. Zendaya never misses. She may not have taken home a Golden Globe for her performance in Challengers, but she stole the spotlight in this burnt orange look by Louis Vuitton. From the silhouette of the dress and its the elaborate train to the sparkling Bulgari diamonds, this may be one of Zendaya's most glamorous looks of all time. We love when men think outside of the box on the red carpet, however Redmayne's checkered Valentino suit is a reminder to all that sometimes a classic black tuxedo will do just fine. Let's hear it for the boy! Andrew Garfield wasn't nominated for a Golden Globe this year, but this hunter green Gucci suit and its accessories deserves all the praise. Eddie Redmayne, take notes. It feels blasphemous to put Jolie on a worst dressed list, but here we are. The Maria star has delivered some of the greatest red carpet moments and yet fell flat with the styling of this gun metal Alexander McQueen gown. We have high hopes that Jolie will pull out all the stops for awards season! Let us know what you think by commenting below and tweeting @YahooStyleCA!

Here's who hit their numbers. All information via Spotrac and ESPN. Evans earned a $3 million bonus in dramatic fashion, crossing the 1,000-yard receiving yardage mark on the final play of the season. The 9-yard catch in a win over the New Orleans Saints triggered a massive celebration by Evans and teammates. In addition to the $3M, he also cashed $666,666 by finishing top-10 in the NFL in receiving touchdowns, with 11. Smith cashed $6 million in total bonuses in Sunday's win over the Los Angeles Rams by reaching a career high in passing yards, completion percentage and helping Seattle to 10 wins. Not bad for a day's work. Mayfield picked up an extra $2.5 million by finishing top 10 in the league or top five in the NFC each of these five categories: passer rating, touchdown passes, passing yards, completion percentage and yards per pass attempt. Those stats were worth $500,000 each for Mayfield. Miller recorded an early sack agains the Patriots, which brings him to six on the season and earns him a $1.5 million bonus. Sutton received $500,000 bonuses for reaching 500 and 750 yards receiving, then added an additional $500,000 by eclipsing 1,065 yards on the season during Sunday's game against the Kansas City Chiefs. Hollins caught two passes early against the Patriots and hit 30 catches on the season, earning a $50,000 bonus. That's right, punter incentives! Martin needed one more punt downed inside the 20, and he got it. Payout: $100,000. Henry entered Saturday having already earned plenty of money. He had incentives of $500,000 each when he hit 1,200 and 1,500 rush yards, which he's already banked with 1,783 rushing yards. His 14 touchdowns mean he's also earned another $500,000 for scoring 13 TDs, but then he scored two more to earn yet another $500,000 for 15 TDs. And if he and the Ravens win the Super Bowl, Henry gets another $500,000. He hit the 12.5-sack mark with his takedown of Cleveland's Dorian Thompson-Robinson, triggering a $250,000 incentive. He celebrated the windfall like most of us would. Gesicki needed 3 receiving yards to reach 600 on the season, which would trigger a $125,000 incentive. He got it on Joe Burrow's first completion of the game Saturday vs. the Steelers, a 12-yard reception. There are a few more incentives left for Barkley to get, but those aren't based on his play in Week 18. With 2,283 yards from scrimmage, Barkley has already banked $500,000 in incentives for surpassing both 1,500 and 2,000 yards from scrimmage. The rest of his contract incentives are about awards and playoff wins. He picked up $250,000 Thursday for being named to the Pro Bowl. He gets $500,000 if he's a first-team All-Pro. He also gets $250,000 if the Eagles win the conference championship, and another $250,000 if they win the Super Bowl. Ertz was set to earn $250,000 each for catching 60-plus passes, tallying 600-plus receiving yards, and scoring six touchdowns. Coming into Sunday, Ertz needed five catches, 62 yards, and two touchdowns to hit those incentives. And thanks to one heck of a game against the Atlanta Falcons, Ertz did it. In total, including overtime (which the Commanders won), Ertz caught six passes for 72 yards and two touchdowns, earning all three incentives and $750,000 total. But he wouldn't have done it without overtime, during which Ertz snagged three passes for 16 yards and a touchdown.",62,[],2025-01-06 04:10:13,2025-01-09 00:30:46

With several former teammates in the building, the native son of Chicago was honored in a ""Derrick Rose Night"" halftime ceremony at the United Center on Saturday during a game between the Bulls and the New York Knicks, the two teams that represented 11 of Rose's 15 seasons in the NBA. You can watch the entire ceremony here. Speakers consisted of Bulls commentator Stacey King, and Bulls and Knicks teammate Joakim Noah. The latter's speech moved Rose to tears.

You have to show courage that [even though] people dislike you or whatever it is, that I'm confident in my choice. I'm confident that I will make it. I want to be great. You want to be great ""So thank you Chicago for forcing me to be great, putting those expectations on me, not understanding that I was trying to be great the entire time too, and I just didn't know the environment that I was in that was forcing me to. So thank you for everybody that watched me since I was in sixth grade, seventh grade, eight grade, injuries, MVP, playoff losses, playoff wins, thank you."" Rose announced his retirement in September, with his place in Chicago basketball history more than secure. He was the local star from Simeon High School who came back, by a stroke of fortune, as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2008 NBA Draft and turned the suffering Bulls into an Eastern Conference contender. Injuries ultimately ended his run as an elite player, but his reception Saturday showed the city still thinks of him as a star. The Bulls announced earlier Saturday that Rose will be the fifth player in team history to have his number retired, joining Michael Jordan (23), Scottie Pippen (33), Jerry Sloan (4) and Bob Love (10), with a ceremony to be held at a later date.

The entire state is under a winter storm warning as of Sunday with Gov. Wes Moore declaring a state of preparedness Saturday, which enhances the state’s ability to respond effectively to potential weather hazards.

The White House said on Monday that Biden will use his authority under the 70-year-old Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to protect all federal waters off America’s east and west coasts, the eastern Gulf of Mexico and portions of the northern Bering Sea in Alaska. Meanwhile, Trump’s victory over Biden’s vice president Kamala Harris in November’s presidential election will be formally certified by a joint-session of Congress today, the occasion coinciding with the fourth anniversary of the Capitol riot of January 6 2021.

Now she is set to certify his win Biden stresses importance of remembering Jan 6 in Washington Post editorial Trump trails ‘powerful bill’ and rages about hush money sentencing 12:40 , Joe Sommerlad President Joe Biden has moved to ban new offshore oil and gas development along most US coastlines, a decision that President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to boost domestic energy production, may find difficult to reverse. The White House said on Monday that Biden will use his authority under the 70-year-old Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to protect all federal waters off the East and West coasts, the eastern Gulf of Mexico and portions of the northern Bering Sea in Alaska. The ban will affect 625 million acres of ocean. Biden said the move was aligned with both his climate change agenda and his goal to conserve 30 per cent of US lands and waters by 2030. He also invoked the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, saying the low drilling potential of the areas included in the ban did not justify the public health and economic risks of future leasing. “My decision reflects what coastal communities, businesses, and beachgoers have known for a long time: that drilling off these coasts could cause irreversible damage to places we hold dear and is unnecessary to meet our nation’s energy needs,” Biden said in a statement. “It is not worth the risks.” The announcement comes as Trump has pledged to reverse Biden’s conservation and climate change policies when he takes office later this month. During his term, Biden limited new oil and gas leasing on federal lands and waters, drawing criticism from drilling states and companies. But the Lands Act, which allows presidents to withdraw areas from mineral leasing and drilling, does not grant them the legal authority to overturn prior bans, according to a 2019 court ruling. That order came in response to Trump’s effort to reverse Arctic and Atlantic Ocean withdrawals made by former President Barack Obama at the end of his presidency. Even Trump used the law to ban sales of offshore drilling rights in the eastern Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida through 2032. Biden’s decision will protect the same area with no expiration. Trump transition spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, on X, called Biden’s decision “disgraceful” and reiterated Trump’s campaign pledge to increase US drilling, without offering details. An oil and gas industry trade group said the decision would harm American energy security and should be reversed by Congress. 12:10 , Joe Sommerlad Here’s the latest bluster from the president-elect on social media, which finds him keeping the heat under Mike Johnson days after his narrow re-election as House speaker and continuing to stew over Judge Juan Merchan’s plan to sentence him on Friday over May’s hush money conviction. 11:40 , Joe Sommerlad Reflecting on the events of four years ago in an editorial for the Post this morning, the president tells America its way of life was sorely tested that winter’s day in January 2021 but prevailed. As Trump plots a mass pardoning for the 1,600 people prosecuted over their roles in the Capitol riot, Biden warns against historical revisionism by writing: “We should be proud that our democracy withstood this assault. And we should be glad we will not see such a shameful attack again this year. “But we should not forget. We must remember the wisdom of the adage that any nation that forgets its past is doomed to repeat it. We cannot accept a repeat of what occurred four years ago. “An unrelenting effort has been underway to rewrite – even erase – the history of that day. To tell us we didn’t see what we all saw with our own eyes. To dismiss concerns about it as some kind of partisan obsession. To explain it away as a protest that just got out of hand.” 11:10 , Joe Sommerlad Here’s more from Kelly Rissman on what promises to be a pretty galling day for the vice president after she spent her summer and fall denouncing the incoming president as a “petty tyrant” and a “fascist” and now finds herself presiding over the formal recognition of his victory. Harris called Trump a danger to democracy. Now she is set to certify his election win 10:40 , Joe Sommerlad Good morning! Donald Trump’s victory over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in November’s presidential election will be formally certified by a joint-session of Congress on Monday, the occasion coinciding with the fourth anniversary of the Capitol riot of January 6 2021. One of the darkest days in American history, the date will live in infamy for the violent scenes that erupted between Trump supporters and local law enforcement on the steps of the Capitol, clashes that resulted in the deaths of five people and left many more injured as the legislative complex was invaded and vandalized. The rioters were fired up by the 45th and soon to be 47th president’s false claims that he had been cheated out of a second term by a nationwide conspiracy to rig the 2020 vote in Joe Biden’s favor, which he continues to insist took place despite failing to produce any evidence. The states’ electoral vote records will be transported to the House of Representatives, where they will be unsealed at 1pm ET (6pm GMT) today and read aloud in alphabetical order. Given that the duty of presiding over the process falls to the vice president, Harris will have to formalize her own defeat. Here’s more. Congress to certify Trump’s election on fourth anniversary of Capitol riot 09:30 , John Bowden House speaker emerita Nancy Pelosi discussed the ongoing threat of political violence and the dangers posed by Donald Trump’s 2020 misinformation campaign in an interview Sunday on Face the Nation. The former top Democrat in the lower chamber said that her husband, Paul Pelosi, still faces medical issues resulting from a violent attack he suffered in 2022, when an intruder in their home attacked him with a hammer. The suspect, David DePape, was convicted of the violent attack and found to have been consumed by far-right conspiracy theories promoted by various figures aligned with MAGA Republicanism, including the 2020 stolen election conspiracies promoted by Trump himself.

The streaming arm of the tech giant got exclusive licensing rights for a streaming and theatrical release later this year, the company said Sunday. Filming is already underway on the documentary. The company said in a statement that the film will give viewers an “unprecedented behind-the-scenes look” at Melania Trump and also promised a “truly unique story.” The former and now future first lady also released a self-titled memoir late last year. Her husband takes office on January 20.

In an op-ed published in The New York Times, Aquilino Gonell, a former sergeant in the Capitol Police, said a pardon “outrageous mistake,” that could put him and other law enforcement officers in danger. “I remain haunted by that day. Now Mr. Trump’s promised actions could erase the justice we’ve risked everything for,” he said. “Releasing those who assaulted us from blame would be a desecration of justice. If Mr. Trump wants to heal our divided nation, he’ll let their convictions stand.” 03:30 , Eric Garcia After a whipsaw couple of hours, Mike Johnson remained speaker of the House of Representatives with the help of some pressure from President-elect Donald Trump. The move shows that the mild-mannered Louisianan is a far more deft politician than his predecessor Kevin McCarthy, who had to go fifteen rounds before he became speaker two years ago. But Johnson’s speech afterward did not set the tone, nor did the speech of House Republican Conference Chairwoman Lisa McClain. Rather, it came when House Democratic Caucus Chairman Pete Aguilar nominated Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and called Democrats the “governing majority.” Keep reading: Mike Johnson may be the speaker, but Democrats will still have power 02:00 , Josh Marcus Conservative commentators were outraged after the Biden administration gave billionaire investor and Democratic mega-donor George Soros the Medal of Freedom. Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon called on the incoming Trump administration to rescind the medal, the nation’s highest civilian honor. “Send a team to track down Soros and take the medal back,” Bannon said on his War Room podcast. “It is a disgrace that a demonic individual like that—who has been going out of his way to try to destroy this country, to mock this constitutional republic, which he hates and has dedicated his life to destroying—that we would be presenting him, awarding him, the highest civilian honor that you can give.” Read more: MAGA-world in meltdown after seeing George Soros awarded Medal of Freedom 00:30 , Katie Hawkinson MSNBC panel members burst into laughter while reading President-elect Donald Trump’s most recent social media rant. Trump posted a rant on Truth Social Saturday morning decrying his legal woes after Judge Juan Merchan ordered him to appear for sentencing in his hush-money case on January 10, just over one week before his inauguration. “There has never been a President who was so evilly and illegally treated as I,” Trump wrote. “Corrupt Democrat judges and prosecutors have gone against a political opponent of a President, ME, at levels of injustice never seen before.” Sunday 5 January 2025 23:00 , Katie Hawkinson Republican Senator Jim Banks revealed he believes Speaker Mike Johnson wouldn’t have won his leadership role without President-elect Donald Trump’s support. “Donald Trump weighed in in support of Mike Johnson. I don’t think Mike Johnson would be Speaker of the House this morning if Donald Trump wouldn’t have weighed in last week, spent political capital helping him get elected on one vote,” Banks told CNN on Sunday. “And to me, that’s a positive sign that House Republicans are unified behind Donald Trump, the Trump agenda,” he added. Sunday 5 January 2025 22:30 , Katie Hawkinson New York Representative Mike Lawler, a Republican, suggested Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election in part due to his hush-money conviction. “Well, the great irony in all of this is that I don’t think anyone did more to help elect Donald Trump president of the United States than Alvin Bragg and Tish James,” Lawler told Fox News, referring to Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who prosecuted the hush-money case. In May, Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with a scheme to silence adult film stat Stormy Daniels, whose story about having sex with Trump threatened to derail his 2016 presidential campaign. The judge overseeing the case ordered Trump to appear for sentencing on January 10. However, he has indicated the sentence will be an unconditional discharge. This means Trump will face no jail time, probation or fines.

Trump spoke at the event, praising Eastman and insisting he was “right the whole time,” the outlet reports. MSNBC’s Symone Sanders Townsend slammed Trump’s speech, calling the celebration “sickening.” The party was held without formal invitations or notifications to the media, The Daily Beast reports. Sunday 5 January 2025 21:00 , David Maddox There is an old Asian proverb which goes along the lines of: “He who rides the tiger must beware lest he end up inside.” Nigel Farage might be reflecting on that after his spectacular fall-out with the world’s richest man on an otherwise quiet Sunday. Making an ally of X (Twitter) owner Elon Musk with his vast wealth and enormous influence was always going to be too tempting to refuse for a man who, for the first time in his political career, feels like he has a sniff of actually winning power. The power of a giant social media platform and the possibility of $100m in funds seemed to be a surefire way of getting a shortcut to turning British politics on its head again, after doing it once already with Brexit. Read more: When egos collide: Trump could be next after angry Musk turns on Farage Sunday 5 January 2025 20:30 , Katie Hawkinson Laura Loomer has chimed in on the feud between Elon Musk and Nigel Farage, after the billionaire called for him to step down as leader of the Reform Party. The apparent feud comes after Farage did not back Musk in calling for the release of jailed far-right political activist Tommy Robinson. “President Trump is friends with @Nigel_Farage, @elonmusk,” Loomer wrote on X. “Trump loves Nigel. You can support @Nigel_Farage and also support Tommy Robinson. I know both of them. Tommy is a close friend.” Sunday 5 January 2025 20:00 , Io Dodds With every passing day, the US government inches closer to doing something unprecedented: banning a social media app used by an estimated 170 million Americans each month. But what would happen next? Find out below: What happens if the US bans TikTok? Sunday 5 January 2025 19:30 , John Kampfner As Germans headed into a year gripped by foreboding, I was reminded of an episode a decade ago that struck me then as absurd, and that now makes me marvel at its prescience. I was chairing a conference about the internet in Berlin, sponsored by Google, when one of the participants suggested that the German government should establish a public internet company. Silicon Valley, she proffered earnestly, was the preserve of the American super-rich and could not be trusted to tell the truth or preserve democracy. I scoffed at the idea, though I was too polite to say so. Half of her analysis was, and still is, impossibly quaint and ridiculous. The notion of the state being relied upon to provide an online platform for comment and information – in the very country of Goebbels and the Stasi – stretches credulity. But I must admit that the speaker foresaw the malignancy of the likes of Elon Musk far earlier than I, or anyone I know, ever did.

Sunday 5 January 2025 18:00 , John Bowden Chuck Schumer denied on Sunday that his party misled the public about the extent of Joe Biden’s decline as presidential insiders tell news publications that the lame-duck president still believes he could have won the 2024 election. The leader of the Senate Democratic caucus, now in the minority in the upper chamber, sat down with NBC’s Meet the Press and spoke about the incumbent president’s legacy in an interview on Sunday.

The Tesla tycoon said Mr Farage, who founded the party and is credited with its recent surge in the polls, “does not have what it takes”. His call for change comes as a bitter blow after days of Mr Farage fawning over the world’s richest man, describing him as “a hero” and claiming he makes Reform “look cool”.

His first speech, which Biden intends to deliver after he comes back from Italy on January 12, will be dedicated to foreign policy, NBC News reported. His second and final speech as president will be a farewell address reflecting on his 50-plus years in public service. Neither speech has been fully drafted, but the broad strokes of them have been established, sources told the outlet. Read on: Biden to give two final speeches as he looks to secure legacy before Trump’s return Sunday 5 January 2025 15:30 , Andrew Feinberg When President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden’s belongings are swiftly removed from the White House during President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration, one thing that will leave with them will almost certainly not be replaced – a White House pet. Unlike the official residence of the British Prime Minister, there is no “chief mouser” for the Executive Office of the President who remains in office from administration to administration. Read on: Trump’s return to the White House will make it pet-free again Sunday 5 January 2025 15:00 , Kelly Rissman Republicans now control both chambers. But what is the demographic makeup of Congress? Although only 58 percent of the general population is white, 84 percent of Senators and 72 percent of House Reps in the new Congress are white, according to WDSU. Just 7 percent of the Senate and 8 percent of the House are Hispanic — despite the fact that Latinos make up nearly 20 percent of the U.S. population. Only 5 percent of Senators and 12 percent of Representatives are Black in the 119th Congress, while Black Americans account for nearly 14 percent of the population. The outlet also broke down the demographics by party. Almost all — 92 percent — of Republican Congress members are white; that’s compared to 56 percent of Democrats in Congress who are white. Sunday 5 January 2025 14:49 , Katie Hawkinson President-elect Donald Trump met with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni for an informal visit at his Mar-a-Lago estate on Saturday evening. Trump praised Meloni, saying she has “taken Europe by storm.” “I’m here with a fantastic woman, the prime minister of Italy,” he said. “She’s really taken Europe by storm, and everyone else, and we’re just having dinner tonight.” Sunday 5 January 2025 14:00 , Archie Mitchell Nigel Farage has distanced himself from Tommy Robinson after Elon Musk swung behind the jailed political activist, calling for his release. The Reform UK leader said Mr Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, is “not what we need”, as his party seeks to challenge Labour in upcoming elections. Mr Farage heaped praise on Mr Musk, reportedly mulling a multi-million pound donation to his party, calling him a “hero figure, especially for the youth”.

Fox walked up to the stage to accept the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Joe Biden. Fox is one of 19 people, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Bono, to be given the award on Saturday, the nation’s highest civilian honor. “You defend the values of America, even when they’re under attack,” Biden told the honorees. “Together, you leave an incredible mark on our country, with insight and influence that can be felt around the globe.” Read more: Michael J Fox cheered at White House as he receives Medal of Freedom from Biden Sunday 5 January 2025 11:00 , Kelly Rissman President-elect Donald Trump claimed that Democrats are “giddy” about flags being flown at half-staff in a sign of mourning and respect to honor the late Jimmy Carter during his inauguration. President Joe Biden ordered flags be flown at half-staff to honor the late president, who died Sunday at age 100. Trump has tried to politicize the gesture, since the flags will still be lowered during his second inauguration on January 20. “The Democrats are all ‘giddy’ about our magnificent American Flag potentially being at ‘half mast’ during my Inauguration,” Trump wrote on Truth Social Friday afternoon. “They think it’s so great, and are so happy about it because, in actuality, they don’t love our Country, they only think about themselves. Look at what they’ve done to our once GREAT America over the past four years - It’s a total mess!” Read on: Trump claims Dems are ‘giddy’ flags will be half-staff for his inauguration Sunday 5 January 2025 10:00 , Kelly Rissman Ohio Lt. Gov. Jon Husted is the top candidate to take Vice President-elect JD Vance’s seat in the Senate, CNN reported. Republican Governor Mike DeWine ultimately makes the appointment. But first, Vance must resign before he takes office on January 20. Sources told the outlet that both Husted and DeWine met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in December. It’s not clear what they discussed. The sources also clarified that it’s not a certainty that Husted would accept an appointment since he’s had his eyes set on becoming governor. Sunday 5 January 2025 09:30 , Katie Hawkinson Sunday 5 January 2025 08:00 , Katie Hawkinson Maggie Haberman, CNN political analyst and author of Confidence Man: The Making of Donald Trump and the Breaking of America, said the president-elect may want a ‘display of fighting’ his sentencing next week. “He’s very angry about this case in particular,” Haberman told CNN on Friday. ”He may decide that he wants some kind of a display of fighting it.” “I don’t think we’re going to know that for another two days or so,” she continued. Trump will be sentenced in his hush money case by Judge Juan Merchan on January 10. Merchan indicated on Friday Trump wouldn’t be jailed at his sentencing, instead noting he’ll impose “a sentence of unconditional discharge.” This means no jail time, probation or fines will be imposed on the president-elect. Sunday 5 January 2025 07:00 , Kelly Rissman A majority of Republicans — about 6 in 10 — say they are confident that the votes in the 2024 presidential election were counted correctly after Donald Trump’s victory, according to a new poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Before the election, however, another poll showed that most Republicans were skeptical of the integrity of the vote count. In October, a poll showed that just 2 in 10 Republicans were confident. From the time he lost the 2020 election through his election victory in November, Trump had expressed doubt about the accuracy about the country’s elections — including on Election Day. “A lot of talk about massive CHEATING in Philadelphia,” he baselessly wrote in a Truth Social post on November 5.

He voiced support for one reconciliation package rather than two, which the GOP leadership had endorsed, newly re-elected House Speaker Mike Johnson informed Republicans Saturday, sources familiar with the matter told Politico. Johnson told fellow Republicans that Trump hopes for “one big beautiful bill” that would address border security, energy, and an extension of his 2017 tax cuts, the outlet reported. The president-elect’s preference aligns with that of House Ways & Means Chair Jason Smith, who has pushed for just one piece of legislation rather than the two that Senate Majority Leader John Thune has favored. Thune wanted one bill to be dedicated to tax and the other bill to be dedicated to the border and energy.

So it is unlikely that the prime minister was responsible for telling The Times that Donald Trump “veered off on a series of tangents” in their conversation on 18 December. The president-elect said that so many birds were being killed flying into wind turbines in the US that the coyotes were growing fat. If Starmer, or anyone acting on his behalf, did leak it, it could prove quite the misstep. This is harmless stuff by Trump’s standards, reflecting his known antipathy to “windmills”, as he called them, in a public post on Truth Social yesterday. But the breach of confidence will make it harder for Starmer to engage with the unpredictable fireball coming his way.

Salma Hayek has brought her va-va-voom energy to the 2025 Golden Globes. The actor and philanthropist walked the red carpet at Hollywood’s Beverly Hilton hotel in a Gucci gown. It was a plunging burgundy dress with a sequined bodice and asymmetric train. She upped the ante with her jewelry, which included layers and layers of green Colombian emeralds from Lorraine Schwartz jewelry (over 300 carats, actually), including a gem necklace, dangly earrings, and a cocktail ring. She even wore bright-green eyeshadow to match. Her hair was styled in a wavy half-up, half-down ’do—with some beautiful grays shining through. “So excited to share that I’ll be presenting at this year’s @goldenglobes 🏆” the House of Gucci star wrote in an Instagram post ahead of the ceremony. The award show may be Hayek’s first red carpet of the year, but her look is reminiscent of several gala-worthy gowns she wore in 2024. Just recall the sequined burgundy Gucci gown she wore to the Toronto International Film Festival, or the strapless red dress she slipped into to accept WSJ Magazine’s Innovator Award for Entertainment & Altruism, or the sequin-covered little black dress she debuted at her Kering Foundation’s Caring for Women dinner. Hayek is not nominated for any awards at this year’s ceremony, but she is joining a lengthy and star-studded list of presenters. These include Andrew Garfield, Anya Taylor-Joy, Ariana DeBose, Catherine O’Hara, Colin Farrell, Colman Domingo, Demi Moore, Elton John, Jeff Goldblum, Jennifer Coolidge, Kate Hudson, Kerry Washington, Margaret Qualley, and Zoë Kravitz, among many others.

Counties in northeastern Wisconsin could also get smaller amounts of snow, between a half-inch and two inches. Higher amounts are possible right along the lake. That broad range accounts for the fact that some areas might not experience the snow band at all, explained Phil Kurimski, meteorologist at the NWS' Green Bay office. ""Whoever gets in the band will see heavier totals,"" he said. Part of forecasting snowfall is computing a snow-to-liquid ratio, or how much water the snow is equivalent to. Milwaukee typically sees a 14-to-1 ratio, but tomorrow's snow could be up to 20-to-1, Sheppard said. ""The reason why lake-effect snow tends to produce some of those larger accumulations is it tends to have a higher ratio, meaning that snow is lighter and fluffier and occupies more space,"" he said. More: Hearing a lot about 'lake-effect' snowstorms in the East? They can happen here too. Sheppard said it's important to drive carefully in these conditions, including leaving plenty of space between yourself and the vehicle in front of you. If your community sees higher than expected accumulations, it could be a good idea to avoid commuting and work remotely if you have that option, he said. ""Once you travel west, out of that lake-effect zone, you find yourself in no trouble at all,"" Sheppard said. Temperatures will remain chilly in Wisconsin this week, around the mid-20s, with gusty winds that could make it feel colder.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/saving-species-slow-return-iberian-012859762.html,Saving a species: The slow return of the Iberian lynx,,World,BBC,5 min read,"After edging close to extinction, there are now some 2,000 Iberian lynxes in Spain and Portugal.","António Fernandes - BBC News, Portugal",2025-01-06T09:57:18.000Z,"With his leopard-like spots, Navarro - a male lynx - calls out during mating season as he walks towards a camera trap. Just short of 100cm (39 inches) in length and 45cm in height, the Iberian lynx is a rare sight. But there are now more than 2,000 in the wild across Spain and Portugal, so you're much more likely to see them than you were 20 years ago. ""The Iberian lynx was very, very close to extinction,"" says Rodrigo Serra, who runs the reproduction programme across Spain and Portugal. At the lowest point there were fewer than 100 lynxes left in two populations that didn't interact, and only 25 of them were females of reproductive age. ""The only feline species that was threatened at this level was the sabre tooth tiger thousands of years ago."" The decline of the lynx population was partly down to more and more land being used for agriculture, a rise in fatalities on the roads, and a struggle for food. Wild rabbits are essential prey for the lynx and two pandemics led to a 95% fall in their number. By 2005, Portugal had no lynxes left, but it was also the year that Spain saw the first litter born in captivity. It took another three years before Portugal decided on a national conservation action plan to save the species. A National Breeding Centre for Iberian lynxes was built in Silves in the Algarve. Here they are monitored 24 hours a day. The aim is twofold – to prepare them for life in the wild and to pair them for reproduction. Serra speaks in a whisper, because even from a distance of 200m you can cause stress to the animals in the 16 pens where most of the animals are kept. Sometimes, though, stress is exactly what the lynxes need. ""When we notice a litter is becoming a bit more confident, we go in and chase them and make noise so they are scared again and climb the fences,"" says Serra. ""We're training them not to get close to people in the wild."" That's partly for their own protection, but also so they stay away from people and their animals. ""A lynx should be a lynx, not be treated like a house cat."" So the lynxes never associate food with people, they are fed through a tunnel system at the centre. Then, when the time comes, they are released into the wild. Genetics determines where they end up, to diminish the risks of inbreeding or disease. Even if a lynx was born in Portugal it might be taken to Spain. Pedro Sarmento is responsible for reintroducing the lynx in Portugal and has studied the Iberian lynx for 30 years. ""As a biologist there are two things that strike me when I'm handling a lynx. It's an animal with a fairly small head for its body and extraordinarily wide paws. That gives them an impulse and ability to jump which are rare."" The breeding programme and the return of the lynx have been hailed as great successes, but as their numbers climb there may be problems too. As lynxes are often released on private land in Portugal, the organisers of the reproduction programme have to reach an agreement with the owners first. Where the animals go after that is up to them, and although there have been some attacks on chicken coops, Sarmento says there have not been many. ""This can lead to uneasiness within locals. We've been strengthening the coops so lynxes can't access them, and in some cases we keep monitoring the lynxes and scare them off if needed."" He recounts the story of Lítio, one of the first lynxes released in Portugal. For six months Lítio stayed in the same area but then the team lost track of him. He eventually made his way to Doñana, a national park in southern Spain where he had come from originally. As Lítio was sick, he was treated and then returned to the reproduction team in the Algarve. Within days of his release from the centre he began heading back to Doñana, swimming across the Guadiana river to reach Spain. For a time he disappeared, but eventually he was brought back to the Algarve. When he was released for a third time, Lítio did not venture back to Spain but instead he walked 3km (two miles), found a female and never moved again. ""He is the oldest lynx we have here, and he's fathered plenty of cubs ever since,"" says Sarmento. Three decades after Spain decided to save the lynx, the species is no longer endangered, and Sarmento hopes it'll reach a favourable conservation status by 2035. For that to happen, the numbers need to reach 5,000-6,000 in the wild. ""I saw the species disappearing. It's surreal that we're in a place where we can see lynxes in nature or through camera trapping almost daily,"" says Sarmento. The reproduction team are not being complacent and there are risks involved in their work. Last year 80% of lynx deaths took place on the roads. For now, though, they feel confident the Iberian lynx has been saved.

Martemyanov, who had been working for Izvestia since 2014, was wounded last year in a Ukrainian attack on Donetsk city but had returned to work after his recovery, his paper says. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova called the incident ""deliberate murder"". In a statement, she described it as ""another brutal crime in a series of bloody atrocities"" carried out by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's government.

The waiter, 24, was charged last month for allegedly supplying the late One Direction star with drugs prior to his fatal fall. Paiz was arrested at his home outside of Buenos Aires, Argentina on Friday, January 3, and could face between four and 15 years in prison. Paiz was under house arrest at the time local authorities raided his home. People reported on Friday that both Paiz and his lawyer Fernando Madeo Facente are maintaining that the hotel employee is innocent. Suspect in Liam Payne’s Death Speaks: Braian Nahuel Paiz Claims He ‘Never Supplied’ Star With Drugs Payne, who shot to fame as one of five members of boy band One Direction, died on October 16, 2024, after falling from a third-floor balcony at the CasaSur Palermo Hotel in Buenos Aires. He was 31. A preliminary autopsy cited “multiple traumas” as the cause of Payne’s death, including hemorrhages in his chest, skull and abdomen. The partial autopsy found multiple drugs were reportedly found in his system at the time of his passing, including traces of “pink cocaine” — a mix of methamphetamine, ketamine and MDMA — cocaine, benzodiazepine and crack. Paiz was one of five people charged on Monday, December 30, by Argentina’s National Criminal and Correctional Prosecutor’s Office in connection to Payne’s death. In addition to Paiz, CasaSur employee Ezequiel Pereyra was also charged with allegedly supplying drugs to Payne ahead of his death. Meanwhile, Payne’s friend Roger Nores is among those facing manslaughter charges, along with Esteban Grassi, a receptionist at the CasaSur Palermo Hotel, and the hotel’s head of security Gilda Martin. During an interview with Argentina’s Telefe Noticias that aired in November 2024, Paiz denied dealing drugs to the late musician. Paiz claimed he initially met Payne when he dined at the restaurant where Paiz works in Puerto Madero in the weeks leading up to his death. According to Paiz, Payne “was already under the effects of drugs and he didn’t actually eat anything” at the restaurant. He continued, “We swapped details and saw each other later that night. It was all normal.” 2 Suspects ‘Could Be Arrested’ Soon in Liam Payne Death Investigation: Report Paiz insisted, “I never supplied Liam with drugs,” adding that the pair arranged to meet at the “Hyatt in Palermo” on October 2.

The spokeswoman said there may also be delays due to the weather, but take-offs will not be affected by the restrictions. Meanwhile, Germany's busiest airport in Frankfurt saw 120 of 1,090 flights scheduled for Sunday cancelled, a spokesman for airport operator Fraport told dpa. As runways needed to be cleared and visibility was reduced, the airport's capacity was limited, he said. Additionally, the de-icing of aircraft was taking longer due to the weather conditions, he added. The spokesman advised passengers to check with their airline regarding their flights and, if necessary, to allow extra time for the journey to the airport. Fraport had already warned of possible flight cancellations due to the weather conditions. Train services in the Frankfurt area were also experiencing disruptions due to the winter weather, rail operator Deutsche Bahn reported on Sunday. The disruptions were causing significant delays as well as partial and complete cancellations of trains. By midday, operations were largely back to normal, with only occasional delays reported by the railway company. Long-distance services passing through Frankfurt were primarily affected, with some individual InterCity Express (ICE) trains stopping at Frankfurt South station instead of the main station as a substitute. According to the Deutsche Bahn's press office, other regions in Germany were only indirectly affected.

This is the second town seized by the M23 group in as many days in the mineral-rich North Kivu province. The group has taken control of vast swathes of eastern DR Congo since 2021, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes. Angola has been attempting to mediate talks between President Félix Tshisekedi and his Rwandan counterpart, Paul Kagame. But these broke down last month. ""It is with dismay that we learn of the capture of Masisi centre by the M23,"" Alexis Bahunga, a member of North Kivu provincial assembly, told the AFP news agency. He said this ""plunges the territory into a serious humanitarian crisis"" and urged the government to strengthen the capacity of the army in the region. One resident told AFP that the M23 had held a meeting of the town's inhabitants, saying they had ""come to liberate the country"". The Congolese authorities have not yet commented on the loss of the town. It is not clear how many people were killed in the fighting between the M23 and the army and pro-government militias. The town was reported to be quiet on Sunday. Chinese nationals arrested with gold bars and $800,000 cash in DR Congo Masisi, which has a population of about 40,000, is the capital of the territory of the same name. It is about 80km (50 miles) north of the North Kivu provincial capital Goma, which the M23 briefly occupied in 2012. On Friday, the M23 captured the nearby town of Katale. Last year, there were fears that the M23 would once again march on Goma, a city of about two million people. However, there was then a lull in fighting until early December when fighting resumed. In July, Rwanda did not deny a UN report saying it had about 4,000 soldiers fighting alongside the M23 in DR Congo. It accused the Congolese government of not doing enough to tackle decades of conflict in the east of the country. Rwanda has previously said the authorities in DR Congo were working with some of those responsible for the 1994 Rwandan genocide against ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus. The M23, formed as an offshoot of another rebel group, began operating in 2012 ostensibly to protect the Tutsi population in the east of DR Congo which had long complained of persecution and discrimination. However, Rwanda's critics accuse it of using the M23 to loot eastern DR Congo's minerals such as gold, cobalt and tantalum, which are used to make mobile phones and batteries for electric cars. Last month, DR Congo said it was suing Apple over the use of such ""blood minerals"", prompting the tech giant to say it had stopped getting supplies from both countries.

Ukrainian and Russian officials confirmed the offensive, but the sides offered varying accounts of the scale and efficiency of the new operation. Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the Ukrainian Center for Countering Disinformation, said on Telegram that Ukrainian troops were working to attack the Russians in several directions, and Moscow was “in great distress” from the surprise offensive. “Russia is getting what it deserves,” added Andriy Yermak, a top presidential adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in a brief Telegram post. Ukraine’s General Staff of the Armed Forces has not officially commented on the Kursk offensive, nor has Zelensky or the Ministry of Defense. Russia’s Ministry of Defense said in a post on Telegram that Ukraine launched an offensive Sunday morning Moscow time with two tanks, a mine-clearing vehicle and 12 armored combat vehicles with landing troops. Russian officials claimed to have defeated the initial advance, though it said operations to repel the assault were continuing. Russian military bloggers also confirmed that a major offensive was underway, with popular writer Rybar posting on his Telegram channel that Ukraine introduced into Kursk several formations that had been gathering in the Ukrainian region of Sumy, which neighbors Kursk. Rybar claimed that Ukraine was concentrating its efforts from the city of Sudzha, which Ukraine captured in August, and further north toward the district of Bolshesoldatsky. The offensive comes as Ukraine’s surprise August invasion of Kursk, the first foreign invasion on Russian soil since World War II, has petered out and come under heavy pressure from a Russian counterattack supported by thousands of North Korean soldiers. Ukraine has lost dozens of square miles of territory to the Russian counterattack and has been on the back foot in the region for more than a month. Zelensky said Kursk was a major strategy in the war effort, with the aim being to divert Russian troops from the main fighting in eastern Ukraine while also taking prisoners, destroying Russia’s military assets and proving Moscow was undefended.

The remarks and lack of cooperation for the arrest warrant could push the country’s political crisis toward another confrontation, the outlet reported. Hundreds of protesters braved freezing temperatures early Sunday near Yoon’s residence, calling for his arrest before the warrant expires. Investigators and police attempted to execute the warrant against Yoon on Friday, but retreated from his residence after a standoff with the president’s security service, The Associated Press reported. South Korea’s parliament voted to impeach Yoon last month after he briefly declared martial law and thrust the country into chaos. Yoon apologized after declaring martial law, the first time in the country since 1980. The action sparked outrage from citizens and lawmakers, and the parliament blocked the martial law declaration. Yoon vowed never to declare martial law again, but the impeachment measure passed with wide support. Law enforcement authorities requested an arrest warrant for Yoon as they investigate whether his actions amount to rebellion.

A number of airports across the UK closed their runways Sunday because of heavy snow and ice. Vast swathes of the country were under snow and ice warnings on Sunday, including most of Northern Ireland, the majority of Scotland, and a large part of central and northern England, according to the UK’s Met Office. Almost all of Wales is under a yellow rain warning. Manchester Airport, the country’s third largest airport by passenger size according to the Civil Aviation Authority, said on Sunday morning that it had temporarily closed its runways due to heavy snow. Staff members on the ground were working to clear the snow from the runway, it said in a post on social media, before the runway reopened around 9:45 a.m. Liverpool’s John Lennon Airport also temporarily closed its runway on Sunday morning due to snow, before reopening it at 10:15 a.m. Newcastle International Airport said that “heavy and continuous snowfall” was causing disruption to flight schedules. Birmingham Airport closed for several hours around midnight so that staff could clear the snow, but reopened later on Sunday “as a result of (resilient) teams working throughout the night,” it said on X. And while Bristol Airport in west England closed its doors on Saturday because of “challenging weather conditions,” it reopened later in the evening. The airport warned that the closure may still affect departing flights on Sunday. Train routes in England, Scotland and Wales have also been affected by the poor weather, the country’s National Rail said Sunday morning. “Ice and snow can mean speed restrictions and line closures are implemented to ensure trains are able to run safely on the railway,” it said in a service disruption announcement. National Highways, the government company that operates major roads in England, put out a countrywide severe weather alert for snow across England on Saturday and Sunday. “Road users are advised to take extra care if travelling over the weekend,” it said. Meanwhile in Germany, snow and black ice, as well as poor visibility forced the cancellation of dozens of flights at Frankfurt airport, Germany’s largest. A total of 120 out of some 1,090 flights at the airport were cancelled, Associated Press reported. At Munich airport only one runway was open. Following the snowfall overnight, Germany’s meteorological office warned freezing rain would continue on Sunday, and advised people to avoid unnecessary travel. This story has been updated.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/tanzanias-fuel-revolution-slowed-down-010443913.html,Tanzania's fuel revolution slowed down by lack of filling stations,,World,BBC,5 min read,The authorities want vehicles to switch to gas but the transition has been hampered by a lack of filling stations.,"Basillioh Rukanga & Alfred Lasteck - BBC News, Dar es Salaam",2025-01-05T01:04:43.000Z,"A revolution in vehicle fuel is gaining momentum in Tanzania, but a lack of filling stations means it is stuck in second gear. Like Nigeria and some other countries on the continent, Tanzania is beginning to embrace compressed natural gas (CNG) as an alternative to petrol and diesel. It is seen as cleaner and better for the environment than those fossil fuels, but its relative cheapness is the biggest draw for the 5,000 or so motorists in the East African state who have embraced the change - particularly commercial drivers. This represents a small fraction of Tanzania's vehicles, but the early adopters are paving the way for a wider acceptance of CNG - the government reportedly wants near total adoption by the middle of the century. Tanzania has large reserves of gas under the sea and for those filling up, CNG can cost less than half its petrol equivalent. The potential saving was enough to persuade taxi owner Samuel Amos Irube to part with about 1.5m Tanzanian shillings ($620; £495) to convert his three-wheeled vehicle – known locally as a bajaji - to CNG. But now, having to get the gas twice a day, he often spends more time waiting at a filling station in the largest city, Dar es Salaam, than he does earning money. There are only four places in Tanzania's commercial hub where he can fill up. Quietly frustrated, he says he has to wait for at least three hours every time he wants to refuel, but the savings make it worth it, as he spends just 40% of what he would on the equivalent amount of petrol. The slow-moving queues of vehicles at the Ubungo CNG station snake down the road. Things are orderly – there are three clear lines, one for cars and two for bajajis – but the irritation is palpable. Medadi Kichungo Ngoma, in the queue for two hours already, stares at the vehicles ahead of him as he waits by his silver pick-up truck. He tells the BBC that he was among the first people in the city to convert his vehicle, which involved installing a large cylinder in the back of the pick-up, and reminisces about the short queues. ""Sometimes the attendant would have to be called to serve us,"" he says. He complains that the infrastructure has not expanded to accommodate the increasing demand. This is also the refrain heard at the largest of the city's CNG filling stations near the airport. Sadiki Christian Mkumbuka has waited here for three hours with his bajaji. ""The queue is very long,"" he says, adding that ""we should have as many stations as there are for petrol vehicles"". But the price consideration will keep people coming back. ""I pay 15,000 shillings ($6; £5) to fill my 11kg gas tank, which goes for about 180km,"" says another motorist who introduces himself as Juma, adding that this is less than half the cost for petrol to cover the same distance. The push to encourage motorists to adopt CNG-powered vehicles in Tanzania was hatched over a decade ago but did not begin in earnest until 2018. Those in charge of the project acknowledge that they did not foresee the rapid rise in demand. Aristides Kato, the CNG project manager at the state-oil firm, the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC), tells the BBC that there ""has been a very drastic increase"" recently in the use of natural gas by vehicle owners. ""We found ourselves not having enough infrastructure to support the demand for gas-using vehicles,"" he admits. The authorities, though, want more people to switch to CNG because it is a relatively clean-burning fossil fuel that results in fewer emissions of nearly all types of air pollutants, according to the UN. Plus the locally available natural gas should allow for cheaper prices than petrol. But the cost of converting a vehicle plus the lower mileage that a full tank gives a motorist compared to petrol or diesel may be putting some people off. However, the country manager of Taqa Arabia, an Egyptian company that runs the filling station near the airport, sees the growing demand as a ""positive sign that CNG use has started to develop in Tanzania"". Amr Aboushady says his firm plans to build more stations and hopes to ""replicate our success story in Egypt by helping the [Tanzanian] government best utilise natural gas as an affordable, reliable, cleaner source of energy"". Egypt has pioneered the use of CNG on the continent, with about half a million vehicles converted to a dual-fuel system since the 1990s. Other African countries that have approved CNG use for vehicles include South Africa, Kenya, Mozambique and Ethiopia. The authorities in Tanzania are committed to rolling out more infrastructure and hope to encourage more private investors to get involved. A central CNG ""mother station"" is being built in Dar es Salaam by TPDC, which will supply gas to smaller stations around the country. In addition, TPDC is acquiring five mobile CNG units that will be located in Dar es Salaam as well as the capital, Dodoma, and Morogoro. These measures should in the medium-term lead to shorter queues, but for the time being the lack of filling stations will continue to frustrate Tanzania's CNG pioneers.

Some would surely laugh at the idea of doing such a thing with a 997, although they’d honestly mock the idea with a 996 even more, but we think this build pulls the look off wondrously. Excellent Bad Idea: Ariel Nomad Tactical Even though the car hails from Stuttgart, this 911 now resides in Japan. That helps explain the insane amount of custom work that’s been poured into it. Many Japanese owners like to shave, trim, nip, and tuck their rides to create something new. Not everyone is going to like the results. But we’ve seem some pretty amazing Porsches, Lamborghinis, Ferraris, and plenty of other brands customized in ways that are quite unique. This particular build was done by Mun Luck, a gearhead who resides in Gunman, Japan. The guy is obviously proud of his ride and we’re sure just loves the video Harnett Media did featuring it. After all, not only is the cinematography fantastic, it features a cool soundtrack to produce just the right vibe. The front end of this car is courtesy of an Old and New Japan Porsche 997 Slant Nose Conversion kit. You might not have seen one before since they’re not horribly popular in the US and elsewhere, but there are others. With the modified nose comes the relocation of the headlights in the lower front fascia. That really switches up the look of the 997. As for the widebody treatment, it’s a somewhat common thing to do in Japan. People do it elsewhere, but this one not only has those sick fender flares, it has been dropped to an ant’s height of the road. That low, wide stance just looks like a predator ready to strike. Thanks to airbags, the owner can keep this 997 from bottoming out. The ride also sports a roll cage, aftermarket exhaust, nice wheels, and probably plenty more. Sit back and enjoy this video, it’s really cool. Image via Harnett Media/YouTube",6,[],2025-01-06 04:14:04,2025-01-06 21:12:41

Some discontinued parts can now be recreated from a computer drawing—which can introduce an opportunity for innovation and improvement. Such is the case for the owner of a vintage Toyota Corolla who creates 3D parts the way the factory should have but, you know, didn’t. Ryan is the owner of Fat Lip Collective, a Melbourne, Australia-based 3D printer of classic car components and accessories. Mostly focusing on JDM Mazda, Nissan, and Toyota models (e.g., Corolla, RX-7, Silvia, and Skyline), the shop offers bits for the Holden Commodore, too. However, it’s the painstaking level of detail and planning that Ryan puts into each CAD-developed piece that sets him apart. Or, maybe it just makes him a typical mechanical engineer. Consider his latest video, for example. In the 26-minute explainer, Ryan focuses solely on his rhyme, reason, and rhythm in creating a new switch panel for his second-gen KE25 Corolla. To Ryan, nothing is done without a purpose, even if the purpose is to fail. “It’s good to test things as you go before you run off and commit to a design, and possibly pay for a bunch of manufacturing only to realize your errors when it’s too late,” he says, as if from experience. “It’s really what 3D printing is perfect for. Fail fast and fail often.” However, getting to the creative art of failure requires a whole lot of prep work. Let’s backtrack a bit. All Ryan wanted was an “OEM plus” dash insert. Starting at the 2:25 mark, he says he “wanted the switch panel to look like it could’ve been an optional extra in 1974.” But with non-Toyota supercar inspiration a la the chunky style dash switches in Ferraris and DiTomasos of the 70s and 80s because “he likes the vibe.” Other updates include indicator lights, legible text for each control, and the inclusion of Omori JDM meter gauges. One thing he considers is ensuring the 3D part fitment is to OE spec and not the “unceremoniously cut” dash space meant to force-feed an aftermarket head unit. The Toyota dash features steel and plastic so materials come into play, too. Ryan will have to decide whether to replicate that or not. If the latter, then he’ll need to use a strong enough plastic and rethink mounting supports. For the switches themselves, he openly discusses fuses, relays, and, importantly, what he wants them to control. And all of this happens before the pen-to-paper overview that feels like a scene from The Beautiful Mind. Add a James Horner score, and you’ve got the montage of a genius’ thought process (before he goes insane). Thankfully, Ryan remains clear-headed. When addressing why he created a separate custom piece instead of going the easier route of directly modifying the OEM dash, his reason is simple: it limits him. Altering the OE dash means if he wanted to make more of the 3D-printed hybrid, he’d have to get more OE dashes, which Toyota isn’t producing for a 50-year-old Corolla. Even with sufficient supplies, the hybrid part might be challenging to reproduce. Most importantly, he wants to preserve the originality of non-replaceable parts. “If I don’t have to do it, I try not to,” he asserts. Ryan doesn’t reveal the finished product but does show off a prototype PLA print when the clock strike 21:06. Keep in mind, although he proceeds to solder screws and connect the pieces, it’s just a practice run until he gets it perfect.

John Hardy, also known as John George, was last in touch with his family on 14 December, when he drove from Alicante to Benidorm. Mr Hardy's father Billy George, who has travelled to Spain, has said he believes his son is dead. On Friday, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) issued a fresh appeal for members of the public to share information as they assist Spanish police with the investigation. It comes as a search and rescue team from Northern Ireland, that has been in Spain since New Years' Day, has ended its search. On Saturday evening, K9 Search and Rescue NI, an all-volunteer canine search and rescue team, said its search was ""coming to an end, for now, with unfortunately no results in locating missing Belfast man John George"". 𝐔𝐩𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐀𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐞, 𝐒𝐩𝐚𝐢𝐧. Search efforts for our team are coming to an end, for now, with unfortunately no results... Posted by K9 Search & Rescue NI on Saturday, January 4, 2025 Ryan Gray is the team leader of K9 Search and Rescue NI who have been helping locals with the efforts to find Mr Hardy. Mr Gray says this is the first time they have had to deal with a missing person outside of the UK. He said: ""We've searched for people missing in England and Scotland before, but in terms of searching for a person missing from Northern Ireland abroad, this is the first time."" Mr Gray told BBC News NI on Saturday night that the search was ""very productive"". ""We covered very large areas and the challenges that come with that...there's all different sorts of terrain, scrubland, urban areas, water. ""But unfortunately we didn't find anything relating to John."" He added that the family, who asked the team for their assistance, are still in Spain alongside ""lots of John's friends"" and are ""still searching for him"". ""They're definitely going to continue on searching for John."" He said the team are going to keep in ""very close contact"" with John's family and added the team ""don't want to leave"". ""We came out here to find John and we haven't...we will return if the family ask us to come back."" There are seven team members and a victim recovery dog assisting the search. Earlier on Saturday Mr Grey said the weather was ""hot, about 17 or 18 degrees"" and although the team were managing, the search covered ""fairly large areas"". Mr Gray mentioned that issues can crop up regarding logistics to an effort like this, he said that ""a couple of guys had to ask for leave"" and that ""to get our dog out here we had to use a Spanish airline, which involved a few stops along the way, but we're always ready"". On Friday, a public portal opened for information in relation to Mr George's disappearance. The PSNI has said it is ""liaising closely with the missing man's family and other law enforcement agencies"". Additionally, they said liaison officers have been appointed to provide support to the family at this time. ""While the investigation must be progressed by Spanish police, the Police Service of Northern Ireland have made an offer of assistance to police in Spain and will assist with any local enquiries as requested by them,"" a PSNI spokesperson said. Police have asked for anyone who believes they may have information, which could assist the Spanish investigation team, to contact them. Any photographs or footage, including CCTV, mobile phone or dash cam footage, can be shared with the PSNI through the Major Incident Public Portal, and that information will be forwarded to Spanish Police. The PSNI has no jurisdiction over the investigation in Spain and assistance is confined to Northern Ireland at this time.

The accident, which occurred in China, has been making waves on social media, with a video showing the aftermath of the collision. While the accident does not appear to be severe, the implications are significant, particularly for the driver of the Buick. Repairing even minor damage on a car like the Koenigsegg Agera R can be astronomically expensive. With its bespoke components and hand-crafted carbon fiber body, the repair bill could easily run into the tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars. If the accident is deemed to be the Buick driver’s fault, the financial repercussions could be disastrous. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Hao Wai (@haowai_hw) The Koenigsegg Agera R is not just any car; it is one of the fastest hypercars on the planet, renowned for its performance and engineering excellence. Powered by a twin-turbocharged V8 engine, the Agera R produces a staggering 1,124 horsepower and 885 lb-ft of torque. These impressive figures allow the Agera R to achieve incredible speeds, including a sprint from 0 to 186 mph in just 14.53 seconds and a 0–300–0 km/h record of 21.19 seconds. The Agera R held several world records for speed and acceleration, further cementing its place in automotive history. However, the significance of the Agera R extends beyond its performance. With only a limited number produced, each Agera R is a rare and valuable piece of automotive art. The car’s exclusivity, combined with its record-breaking capabilities, makes it highly sought after by collectors and enthusiasts alike. The prospect of damaging such a rare vehicle, even in a minor accident, is a nightmare scenario for any driver involved. As the video of the incident circulates, it serves as a stark reminder of the risks and responsibilities associated with driving near such high-value vehicles. While accidents can happen to anyone, the consequences of even a minor collision can be far-reaching, particularly when it involves a car as rare and valuable as the Koenigsegg Agera R. For now, the details of the incident, including who was at fault, remain unclear. However, one thing is certain: the repair costs for the Agera R will be anything but ordinary, potentially leaving the Buick driver facing a hefty financial burden.

By studying tiny rocks brought back by the Chang’e-5 mission, they found the moon’s magnetic field measured two to four microteslas about two billion years ago, less than 10% of Earth’s current surface field, findings published in Science Advances showed. Ross Mitchell from the Institute of Geology and Geophysics in Beijing explained that the moon's magnetic field persisted much longer than previously believed. The study suggests the weak but enduring magnetic field was likely driven by internal processes such as the crystallization of the moon’s core or core-mantle interactions, according to planetary scientist Benjamin Weiss from MIT, who was not part of the research. These processes likely sustained the moon’s magnetic engine, known as the lunar dynamo, for billions of years. Weiss noted that the findings align with the Chang’e missions' symbolic connection to the moon goddess, who is associated with immortality in Chinese mythology, the South China Morning Post reported. Now, the findings suggest that the moon's persistent magnetic field could have shielded its surface from solar radiation and helped retain volatile compounds like water. This deeper understanding of the moon’s magnetic history provides crucial insights into planetary habitability and evolution. Although the moon no longer generates a magnetic field, evidence suggests it once did. Samples from NASA’s Apollo missions indicated that over three billion years ago, the moon's magnetic field was as strong as Earth’s current field, which ranges from 25 to 65 microteslas. Chinese researchers studying rocks from the moon’s far side, collected during the Chang’e-6 mission, reported that about 2.8 billion years ago, the moon’s magnetic field measured between five and 21 microteslas. However, the duration of the lunar dynamo remains uncertain. Studying Apollo samples to answer this question has been difficult due to their older age, large iron grains that poorly preserve magnetic signals, and other challenges, according to Weiss. In contrast, the 1.73kg (3.8lbs) of rocks collected by China’s Chang’e-5 mission in 2020 are precisely two billion years old, making them much younger than the samples from Apollo or the Soviet Luna missions of 50 years ago. The researchers selected nine small basalt fragments, each 3-8mm (0.1-0.3 inch) in size and weighing less than 0.3 grams (0.01 ounce), for this study. These fragments acted as magnetic recorders, preserving the magnetic field from when they formed billions of years ago. The team then used sensitive lab techniques to extract the ancient magnetic signals. Lead author Cai Shuhui, a colleague of Mitchell’s at the Institute of Geology and Geophysics, explained that small sample sizes result in weak magnetic signals, requiring difficult and meticulous lab work. Fortunately, the Chang’e-5 samples were of sufficient quality for the study, the researcher added.",5,[],2025-01-06 04:14:04,2025-01-06 21:12:52

Razvozhaev’s announcement came after authorities in Russia’s southern Krasnodar region announced a region-wide emergency last week, as the fuel oil continued washing up on the coastline 10 days after one tanker ran aground and the other was left damaged and adrift on Dec. 15. Krasnodar regional Gov. Veniamin Kondratyev said that almost 7,000 people were still working to clean up the spill on Saturday. More than 96,000 tons of contaminated sand and soil have been removed along the region’s shoreline since the original spill, he wrote on Telegram. On Dec. 23, the ministry estimated that up to 200,000 tons in total may have been contaminated with mazut, a heavy, low-quality oil product. Russian President Vladimir Putin has called the oil spill an “ecological disaster.” The Kerch Strait, which separates the Russia-occupied Crimean Peninsula from the Krasnodar region, is an important global shipping route, providing passage from the inland Sea of Azov to the Black Sea. It has also been a key point of conflict between Russia and Ukraine after Moscow annexed the peninsula in 2014. In 2016, Ukraine took Moscow to the Permanent Court of Arbitration, where it accused Russia of trying to seize control of the area illegally. In 2021, Russia closed the strait for several months.

So clear skies and calm winds, overnight low temperatures should fall into the mid to upper 20s. Again another night of cold temperatures. Be sure to protect the pipes and plants. Bring in any outdoor animals. As we head into Sunday, a brief break in the dry air mass. We will start to see some clouds build into the area, especially in the late afternoon, and overnight hours. Our temperatures will warm into the low 50s on Sunday. Sunday night we will see clouds increase, as our next storm system moves into the area. Monday will feature an unsettled day across the area. We will see warm air move into the coastal communities, thanks to some south to southwest winds. This will help elevate high temperatures into the low to mid 60s. Any peaks of sunshine could push temperatures even warmer. This also will bring some rain, and if enough instability can build up some scattered storms across our coastal areas. Inland, depending how far the warm front pushes inland, our temperatures could stay in the 50s or warm well into the 60s. Current thinking is the warm front could advance close to the Interstate 95 corridor. We will continue to watch the progress and update as needed.

In Beijing, Institute 101 of the Academy of Aerospace Propulsion Technology under CASC tested four engine types, including a new hydrogen-oxygen engine. Seen as a crucial step in rocket engine development, the test run involves dozens of mission types, each designed to assess different aspects of the engine's performance and reliability. Tests are expected to be carried out across various stages, both before and after the engine's development, to ensure that every component meets the required standards. According to a Science and Technology Daily report, the comprehensive testing process will provide valuable data to refine the engine design and support its successful deployment in future space missions. The test at the Institute 101 featured an upper-stage hydrogen-oxygen engine, which ignited at 11:21 am on Thursday. It operated for approximately 100 seconds before a standard power-off. As per the report, this marks the successful completion of the engine's ground calibration test run ahead of delivery. Xia Wei, a professional at CASC observed the test evaluated the engine's overall coordination and gathered key performance parameters. ""The just-completed experiment tested an upper-stage hydrogen-oxygen engine. It tested the overall coordination of the engine and obtained performance data. After assessment, we concluded that the test was a complete success,"" Wei explained. Three additional tests were carried out, focusing on the rocket's main propulsion engine, upper-stage engine, and attitude-orbit control engine. Moreover, a liquid-oxygen methane engine test was conducted on a vertical dual-station test stand for the high-thrust hydrogen-oxygen rocket engine in Laiyuan. The report stated that all the tests mentioned were highly successful, making it possible to complete five test runs in a single day. Xia added that in 2025, they will focus on researching and testing multiple engines for deep space exploration, heavy rockets, and other types of engines, which will contribute to the successful execution of China’s major space projects. The new achievement builds upon last year's successes, including the retrieval of China's first reusable and returnable test Shijian-19 satellite. The Shijian-19 met its objectives in several technological areas, including reusability, payload capacity, and re-entry. The satellite also acted as an effective platform for research in microgravity science and space life sciences. Furthermore, the flight tests confirmed the technical specifications of a new generation of high-performance, reusable space experiment platforms. Payloads included 20 categories, such as staple crops, industrial crops, microbial space breeding specimens, electronic components, and space technology experiments.

""At the airport, for example, you may not only get black ice on the runway, [ice] may also get heavy on the plane so it can't take off - so it will cause a lot of disruption. ""It is quite rare for us to get that in the UK."" People are being urged to check in on the vulnerable during the wintry conditions, with amber cold health alerts in place across England. The UK Health Security Agency issues alerts when temperatures are likely to affect people's wellbeing, in particular those who are elderly or have health conditions. NHS chiefs warn the number of people with flu in hospital in England rose sharply over Christmas. The latest data shows there were 5,000 patients in hospital with the virus at the end of last week - almost 3.5 times higher than the same week in 2023. For the second consecutive night, temperatures plummeted across the UK on Saturday. The lowest temperature recorded was -8.6C in Aberdeenshire. In England, it fell to -6C in Bournemouth while in Wales it dropped to -4.2C in Usk, Monmouthshire. Northern Ireland saw a low temperature of -5.5C in Katesbridge, County Down. Police are investigating whether a crash on Thursday night on the A1 near Grantham that led to the death of a seven-month-old boy is linked to icy weather conditions. Three hillwalkers needed to be rescued overnight in the Cairngorms in Scotland after they got into difficulty in the wind and snow. What are cold weather payments and who can get them?

Watch BBC Weather forecast for the week ahead Does the UK get less snow than it used to? Age UK's director Caroline Abrahams said the cold weather would bring the government's decision to limit winter fuel payments ""into sharp relief"", and added the charity had already been contacted by people ""worrying about what to do"". She urged older people ""to do everything they can to stay warm"" including risking spending more on their heating. Ms Abrahams added energy companies had ""an obligation to help"" those struggling and there may be support from local councils too. When asked about the cold weather, Health Secretary Wes Streeting pointed out Chancellor Rachel Reeves had retained the winter fuel allowance for the ""poorest pensioners"" - those in receipt of pension credit. The cut aims to save £1.5bn a year. The Department for Work and Pensions said some postcodes would receive cold weather payments, which entitles some households in postcodes with sustained temperatures below 0C to a £25 payment. This included some postcodes in Eskdalemuir in Dumfries and Galloway, Redesdale in Northumberland, and Shap in Cumbria.

Photo: Shutterstock Images> China last year introduced its home appliance trade-in scheme, offering each local consumer a rebate of up to 2,000 yuan (US$274) per item. Eligible products include refrigerators, washing machines, televisions, air conditioners, computers, water heaters, household stoves, and range hoods. The renewed programme in 2025 enables consumers who already claimed subsidies last year to receive new rebates. Policymakers plan to expand the scope of eligible items to consumer electronics devices, such as smartphones, tablet computers and smart wearables, according to an official from the National Development and Reform Commission on Friday. The project forms part of Beijing's broader efforts to motivate spending and stimulate the economy. As households locked up more of their savings in bank deposits, retail sales in China saw just a 3 per cent year-on-year increase in November, which marked the slowest pace of growth in three months, according to the latest official data. Property investment continued to drag, falling by 10.4 per cent in the first 11 months. When the trade-in programme was rolled out in 2024, Tmall and JD.com were also among the first e-commerce platform operators to quickly launch special landing pages, making it easier for shoppers to browse product listings and use the subsidies when placing orders. During last year's Singles' Day sales events, both companies reported strong sales, particularly in the home appliance category. Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall said 139 home appliance and furniture brands - including Haier, Midea Group and Dyson - each raked in 100 million yuan in gross merchandise value during the month-long campaign. JD.com touted strong participation in the trade-in programme, with users from over 90 per cent of rural and county-level regions taking part.

The Southeast Asian nation is one of the world's biggest contributors of plastic pollution and marine debris, with annual monsoon rains and winds sweeping mountains of plastic waste from its cities and rivers into the ocean. Some of it drifts hundreds of kilometres before washing up on the beaches on the holiday island -- especially between November and March. Across Kedonganan beach in the south of the island, plastic cups, straws, cutlery, and empty coffee sachets were scattered across the sand, mixed with plant and wood debris. - Tons of garbage - Around 600 volunteers, including local residents, hospitality workers, and tourists, braved a rainy morning to pick up the waste by hand before filling hundreds of large sacks. The Environmental NGO Sungai Watch called it ""the worst"" plastic waste pollution to wash ashore in Bali. ""We have never seen plastics a metre thick in the sand. In just six days of cleanup, we collected 25 tons, which is a record for us,"" said Sungai Watch founder Gary Bencheghib. Bencheghib said an audit found most of the plastic waste came from cities on neighbouring Java, Indonesia's most-populated island. Tatiana Komelova, a Russian tourist volunteer, said the sight of the pollution shocked her, and motivated her to reduce the use of plastic in her daily life.

We don’t know if it’s been the stress of the holidays or the fact it’s a hot summer Down Under, but something pushed this guy over the edge. Plus, the victim is the ripe age of 63, which makes the crime even more shocking. Police confront a road rager who takes his aggression out on them. The victim was driving along back on December 21 when another car started tailgating him. We’ve all been there and while that’s an annoying scenario, usually the tailgater moves on and does it to someone else because it’s nothing personal, even if it is dangerous. But in this case, the road the victim was traveling on had a reduced speed limit thanks to an emergency situation and the other driver apparently felt that wasn’t reasonable. When the other driver got into the next lane and pulled up alongside the victim at a stop light, things got a little spicy. This is why we don’t like pulling up window-to-window with another vehicle. But we understand road ragers love doing that sort of thing. A verbal exchange between the two men, then they continued on. The aggressor swerved in front of the victim, slammed on his brakes, then approached the open driver’s window on the victim’s car. That would’ve been an excellent time to close it. After pushing the victim, the road rager bit the 63-year-old man’s finger. Who even does that? What’s the point? It’s like something a little toddler who’s mad would do. Is this what’s happened to society? Is road rage not stupid enough that we now have to bite people who don’t drive the way we like? Having bit the victim, the other man took off and police are now hunting for him. We still can’t believe this is a thing and we certainly hope it doesn’t become some crazy new trend.

These also affected immigration checks conducted by the police. During the outage, officers had to carry out passport and visa checks manually, which led to ""increased waiting times and backlogs,"" a spokesman said. The primary impact was on entries from non-Schengen countries and departures to such countries. The disruptions began around 2pm (1300 GMT)and extra officers had been called to the airports to help with the passport controls. Officials at airports including Frankfurt, Munich, Berlin and Dusseldorf had said that flights were proceeding despite some delays. What caused the IT failure remains unclear.

On Thursday evening, Appleby was surfing Granites Beach, southwest of Streaky Bay on South Australia’s Eyre Peninsula when witnesses saw him attacked by a shark. Following the attack, authorities issued a search for Appleby from land, air, and sea. As of Friday, they have yet to find him. Hours prior to the attack, local fisherman and friend of the Appleby family, Jeff Schmucker, spotted a great white shark at the very same spot, and issued this warning via social media: “Heads up to all the surfers at Granites today. There is a large, aggressive great white very close to Granites/Indicators.” And after the attack, amidst the search for Appleby, Schmucker told the Australian Associated Press there was “no point looking for anything out there. Lance’s body’s inside the shark and the shark’s probably not very far away. If they want to do something about it, they should do it now. Fisheries have the power to give a destruction order, but the government doesn’t have the balls.” Great white sharks are a protected species in South Australia with a penalty up to $20,000.

Ahmed Moalim Fiqi's statement, carried by state TV, said Somalia had made no concessions. Ethiopia has not commented on the Somali claim, but said the two countries had agreed to ""strengthen bilateral relations"". The two neighbours had been at loggerheads since last January when landlocked Ethiopia signed a maritime deal with the breakaway Somaliland, which Somalia considers as part of its territory. Friday's statement follows a visit to Somalia by an Ethiopian delegation in the latest sign of détente after a Turkey-brokered deal announced last month. Led by Ethiopian Defence Minister Aisha Mohammed, the visit focused on the future of the African Union (AU) peacekeeping mission in Somalia. Ethiopia has thousands of troops stationed in Somalia which are not part of the AU force and it has not been clear what role they will play in the future. In its statement, Ethiopia said the two countries had agreed to collaborate on the mission. A statement from Somalia's foreign ministry was a little more equivocal saying the country had ""expressed its willingness to consider Ethiopia's request to contribute forces"" to the mission. Ethiopia-Somaliland deal: Can the Horn of Africa rift be healed? Ethiopia warns against invasion amid regional tensions Why Ethiopia is so alarmed by an Egypt-Somalia alliance Somalia had previously said it could expel Ethiopian troops over the Somaliland deal. Throughout last year, tension was high after Ethiopia announced plans to build a naval base in Somaliland. The breakaway republic said the deal included a commitment for Ethiopia to officially recognise it as an independent country, but Addis Ababa never confirmed this. At the time Somalia said it saw the deal as an act of ""aggression"" and an affront to its sovereignty. Somaliland, which broke away from Somalia more than 30 years ago, has long been pushing for recognition. Just weeks ago it would have been unthinkable for officials from Ethiopia's defence ministry to be holding talks in the Somali capital, Mogadishu. Relations between the neighbours were so bad, there were fears a wider regional feud was brewing - with Ethiopia on one side and Egypt backing the Mogadishu government. But as a result of Turkey's mediation, things have improved, with both countries agreeing to recognise each other's sovereignty. According to the Ankara joint declaration of 12 December 2024, the Horn of Africa neighbours are to reconvene in February to hold ""technical talks"". Until then, they are to strive to reach ""mutually beneficial commercial arrangements"" to ensure Ethiopia gains access to the sea ""under Somalia's sovereignty"". It is not clear if Ethiopia has discarded the deal it signed with Somaliland. Somali state TV quoted Fiqi as saying ""that file… was closed after Somalia's demands were tabled and accepted but not due to concession or setting aside the principles we used to defend our course"".

Ghana is now the fifth African country to offer this to travellers from the rest of the continent. Rwanda, Seychelles, The Gambia and Benin are the others. ""I am proud to have approved visa-free travel to Ghana for all African passport holders, with effect from the beginning of this year,"" Akufo-Addo told lawmakers in his last address to parliament before he steps down next week after eight years in office. ""This is the logical next step to the African Continental Free Trade Area and the workings of the largest trading bloc in the world,"" he said referring to the zone that came into effect four years ago. In an annual African ranking of visa-openness, Ghana was placed fifth last year as it already offered visa-free travel to citizens of 26 continental countries.

Trump’s strong anti-immigrant rhetotic on the campaign trail has worried faith voices across the denominational spectrum, and Catholic voices especially due to the church’s support for immigrant rights through parish ministries and nonprofits like Catholic Charities. The Kentucky and Tennessee bishops’ statement is specifically about their support for legal immigration while they also prioritize “just and humane treatment of all migrants, including access to legal protections, and due process,” the Dec. 29 letter said. The letter’s signatories are Kentucky’s four Catholic leaders — Archbishop Shelton Fabre of the Louisville diocese, Bishop William Medley of the Owensboro diocese, Bishop John Stowe of the Lexington diocese, and Bishop John Iffert of the Covington diocese as well as Tennessee’s three Catholic leaders — Bishop J. Mark Spalding of the Nashville diocese, Bishop David Talley of the Memphis diocese, and Bishop Mark Beckman of the Knoxville diocese. Starting in November, similar statements have received endorsements from bishops in Arizona, California, New Mexico, Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas. Other Catholic leaders are seeking ways to equip their communities ahead of any potential drastic action by the federal government to detain and deport immigrants. As examples, National Catholic Reporter said a diocese in Washington state provides “Know Your Rights” resources, while Religion News Service highlighted efforts within the San Antonio, Texas diocese to distribute a form of identification known as congregational IDs. Federal, state and even municipal policy will supersede churches’ best efforts to support and perhaps even shield immigrations. For Tennessee, Gov. Bill Lee has already expressed willingness to assist the incoming Trump administration’s actions on immigration. There’s little available data about immigration demographics within Tennessee or Nashville’s Catholic community, though Pew Research Center reported last April about 40% of Catholics in the South are Hispanic. Due to the growth of Hispanic parishioners within the Nashville diocese, prospective area priests who are studying in seminary are learning to be bilingual in English and Spanish.

They include the social-emotional learning tool Sown to Grow, the gamified learning management system Classcraft and the math tool Levered Learning, among others. In the process, the Kansas City nonprofit has become synonymous with a research technique known as “co-design,” which says innovation should begin not with outsiders offering solutions, but with those trying to solve problems for themselves. Leanlab took shape after its founder, a former teacher named Katie Boody Adorno, began studying how education systems work. The child of community organizers with roots in Puerto Rico, Boody Adorno had taught for five years and realized that education could learn from the way her parents’ efforts worked. Education is at a Crossroads: Help Us Illuminate the Path Forward. Donate to The 74 Education is at a Crossroads: Help Us Illuminate the Path Forward. Donate to The 74 “It was surprising to me how much we excluded community voice in the education sector,” she said, “and how unimaginative we were in that sector. It was still very top-down bureaucratic, and it wasn’t particularly effective.” Related Leanlab began life as a kind of tech incubator, evolving into a quietly influential organization that helps ed tech developers work with educators to evaluate their products in real classrooms. From there it has moved into several different aspects of research, partnering with University College-London to co-found the Global Edtech Testbed Network, a hub for researchers, policymakers, philanthropists and tech investors to work together. One of its most recent studies found that of 1,640 tech tools in schools, just 11% are evaluated externally. Last summer, Leanlab also partnered with 20 school districts, charter schools, microschools and afterschool programs to create something called the American Group of Innovative Learning Environments. It works with educators, helping them research their most pressing questions. And it pays teachers $50 per hour for their work implementing the research. The focus, Boody Adorno says, is on solving real-life problems in their classrooms. In the process, teachers are also trained in research techniques. In an interview with The 74, Boody Adorno stressed the importance of co-design and her belief that technology is changing schools rapidly — so rapidly that large-scale, randomized control trials, which can take years to design and implement, are no longer a good fit for many research questions. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. The 74: You talk about being the child of community organizers. When you talk about “community voice,” what are you thinking? Katie Boody Adorno: I was a middle school teacher in both public schools and charter schools. This was during the No Child Left Behind era, 2008 to 2013. It was a very test-driven culture that was very bureaucratic. You had a lot of big administrators from central office or the state department of education telling you what you needed to do. You had scripted curriculum. You had pacing guides that were very assessment-driven. We also were dealing with massive school closures in the city. All of this felt very “done to” communities. You were literally told what you were going to teach, how you were going to teach it, if your school was going to stay open or not. Teachers didn’t have a say in this. Building leaders didn’t have a say in this. Parents didn’t have a say. Certainly not our students! And then we were shocked when, year over year, we were seeing pretty dismal results — or when the tests came back and said, “Your schools are not performing on par with more affluent or white schools.” Let’s talk about how Leanlab came about. Were you still teaching at the time? Had you moved out of the classroom? I taught for five years. I’d moved to an instructional coach role, where I still was teaching one class. I had gone back to graduate school to become an administrator and I was on that career trajectory. I was in a charter school system and I really thought I wanted to be a school leader. But the more I was exposed to the system, the more skeptical I was becoming. I now had the opportunity to slice the data from a higher-level viewpoint and I was just like, “Man, this isn’t working. We’re not seeing transformation for our kids. But it’s not because we don’t have teachers who are working really hard.” We had a brilliant staff, but it was unsustainable. We were burning teachers out. Our kids were going to school, at that point, six days a week. Even when we were getting strong test results in the state exam, it wasn’t translating into life outcomes for our kids. I became pretty disillusioned, but really committed to the future of our kids. Related At the same time, you were getting to know the startup community in Kansas City? I got the chance to attend a couple of events and two things struck me: The way they talked about the innovation process was so much more human-centered and actually aligned to community organizing principles. It was really this notion of elevating end-user insights, designing with who you’re serving, which was something that we never really talked about in education. Related The other piece was just the radical innovation. Now it’s kind of a trope and we laugh about it, this idea of disrupting systems. But this was a decade ago, when this language was just coming out. And it struck me as really, really interesting: There’s another way to think about education that we haven’t talked about. I started hosting pop-up events to teach educators how to go through these innovation processes. I was trying to organize at a really grassroots level, bringing together educators, researchers, community leaders to think about what it would mean to begin prototyping new things that could accelerate student outcomes. When you say “prototyping new things,” you mean products? In those early days, it really was all over the place. Oftentimes it was technology products. Oftentimes it was new school models, new programs or curricula. But the idea would be: Start first with a problem that your community is identifying. It could be, “Hey, we’re really struggling on basic literacy. We’re really struggling with students feeling safe at school.” Whatever it is, start first by validating that from the community itself that’s experiencing that pain, and then begin prototyping a new solution. Fast-forward 10 years: When you look at what you’re doing now, what do you see? We got pretty good at building commercially viable ventures — a lot of these companies were going on and scaling and making money. But we weren’t solving the problem of knowing if they were actually moving the needle for students across the board. And when we looked at the sector about five years ago, we realized very few tech solutions had any evidence that they were accelerating learning outcomes for kids or even demonstrating any evidence that they were beneficial to students. So that’s when we underwent another pivot, just before the pandemic, where we said, “We have great relationships with these local schools. We have emerging respect from this entrepreneur community. What does the world look like where we actually bring in researchers more seriously, deepen our relationships with schools so that we can run more in-depth trials?” The end goal here is that we actually want to see outsized impact. We want technology to actually live up to its promise of accelerating student outcomes beyond what we’ve seen. At that point, we brought in an internal research team. We flipped our business model. So we charge for-profit ed tech companies. We grant money — we believe in unrestricted grants — to schools, and offer market rate stipends. We typically pay teachers $50 an hour. Related Let’s talk about co-design. I’d like to hear a little bit about that process. Co-design is really interesting because it’s become buzzy. People are throwing it around a lot and there’s not a lot of understanding of exactly what it means. When you design solutions or technologies in a silo with a technologist developer and a company that doesn’t have access to the realities of a school environment, it cannot be very beneficial. And unfortunately, this has happened a lot in the ed tech sector because typically these technologies are selling to administrators but delivering to students. So oftentimes they don’t think about the design for students or teachers because the customer is not the user. Co-design has come to be used as colloquial lingo around what it means to elevate the user’s perspective and give feedback to the product or solution when it’s being developed, so that it actually benefits them. Let’s talk about these problems that actual educators identify. What have been some of the hits? There’s no clear winner, but I would say across the board, folks are still very concerned about learning loss, primarily post-pandemic, primarily in literacy and math. We’re thinking about solutions that target upper elementary literacy and math, particularly in literacy, where a lot of schools have now gotten LETRS training for the Science of Reading, but our older kids might have been left out. So those kids are still struggling with basic concepts. Social-emotional learning or well-being — whatever geography allows you to say — is still a huge priority. That’s also now become educator well-being. Teaching with technology is a big one, particularly with AI, “What is safe? What is reasonable? How do we prepare the workforce to do that?” And then college and career readiness and preparation for an ever-changing workforce. People call that different things: real world learning and experiential learning, portrait of a graduate, college readiness. But it’s this idea of, “How are they getting prepared for the future?” Are there products, for lack of a better term, that people would recognize that have come out of all this work? Or is it too early to talk about that? No, it’s not. We’ve done 80 studies. And prior to that, in our five years of doing research and development, we worked with small startups that are just getting off the ground. Folks that are federally funded. We’ve done a lot of research for a tool called Sown to Grow, based out of the Bay Area. They’ve gone on to do really great evidence-based work around cultivating a culture of increased belonging and well-being and social-emotional learning. And we work with big incumbents on new products, like Logitech, McGraw-Hill and others. So do you become their research arm? What can you do for McGraw-Hill that they don’t already have in-house? What we functionally do is match them with schools and we have a third party R&D team that will help them figure out if their product is working. And we align all of our evaluation to the federal criteria for evidence. So if they really want third-party evidence, we can be the one that does that. What’s unique about us is that we’re really nimble. We’re one of the only research firms that’s connected to a school network. So we’ll say, “Hey, let’s put this in front of a diverse student or school audience. Let’s get feedback.” Related So you’ve kind of gone from being an incubator to being an American Institutes for Research? We’re an R&D firm that’s much more nimble and focused exclusively on co-design and technologies. We’re uniquely positioned where we’re different than AIR or WestEd. We’re not really doing randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We’re not doing what we believe is maybe an outdated mode of research. We’re really trying to elevate school community insights and take an iterative approach. I’ve been writing about education research for 25 years, and when people complain about it, most often the complaint is, “You’re not doing an RCT. That’s the gold standard.” To hear somebody like you say, “Hold on a second, that’s not the best format” is striking. RCTs are a pain in the ass to do for actual educators. Any educator, ask them if they think it’s equitable to randomly implement a solution that you think is going to be really effective for their kids, but assign it randomly, withhold it randomly and try to implement a cohesive curricular framework around that. That’s just really hard to do and raises some interesting ethical questions. The other piece is that we’re just in an age of technology vastly outpacing our traditional R&D systems. If you do a traditional RCT, it might take you a year and a half to recruit the number of participants you need to engage in that study. The intervention has completely changed by that point — and it’s going to change again by the time you get the findings back. So how helpful is that for the field?

School closures are widespread and multiple cities and states declared emergencies. The system, named Winter Storm Blair by The Weather Channel, put millions under winter storm warnings. (MORE: The Latest Winter Storm Forecast | Winter Storm Maps Tracker) Here's what's happening now: Cincinnati saw a total snowfall of 8.4 inches of snow Sunday. That broke the daily record of 6.9 inches set in 1977, the National Weather Service said. Dayton saw 2.7 inches of snow Sunday, tying a daily record set in 1903. It snowed so much in Topeka, Kansas, that it will take up to four days to clear all city streets. A post shared to the city's social media accounts says road clearing started Sunday night and continues around the clock. Crews will clear streets as they become accessible. Topeka's snowfall total from the storm topped 14 inches. Sunday was the city's third snowiest day on record, according to the National Weather Service. The wintry weather isn’t over for the South and East once Blair heads out. Many of the same areas hit by Blair will see more snow and ice as another winter storm heads across the country. “The next winter storm will begin to emerge in the Southern Plains by Wednesday night and especially Thursday. It could spread snow from parts of northern Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas to other portions of the South, the Ohio Valley and possibly parts of the East by Friday or Saturday,” weather.com Digital Meteorologist Chris Dolce said. “However, the track of this storm is still uncertain and that will determine what areas see significant snow and/or ice.” Keep checking back for updates on the next storm, since changes are very likely as the week progresses. Ice is knocking down trees and power lines, leaving some roads blocked and hundreds of thousands without electricity. A photo shared to social media showed some of the damage in Kentucky, where more than 80,000 power outages are being reported. Arrivals at Chicago O'Hare International Airport are currently delayed by up to 90 minutes due to snow and ice, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. In all, more than 360 flights to or from Chicago are canceled or delayed. Here's how air travel is playing out at some other major airports affected by weather today, according to airline tracker FlightAware.com: Reagan National in Washington, 476 flights canceled or delayed. Baltimore/Washington International, 276 flights canceled or delayed. Washington Dulles, 220 flights canceled or delayed. St. Louis Lambert International, 216 flights canceled or delayed. Virginia State Police said in a press release that they responded to more than 200 crashes between 4 p.m. Sunday and 4 a.m. Monday. Not all accidents were storm related. There were several injuries, the Associated Press reported. Winter Storm Blair’s death toll is now at four after Missouri State Police reported that a person was hit by a dump truck that was sliding on a slick road in Jackson County. The truck hit another vehicle as well. Drivers in several areas are being asked to stay home due to road conditions in Indiana, including in the Bloomington area where a photo posted by state police showed an empty, snow-covered Interstate 69. Crews are working to clear the snow off of roads in Washington, D.C., ahead of a joint session of Congress to certify Electoral College votes for the presidential election.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/maddow-blog-ahead-sentencing-trump-132417511.html,"Maddow Blog | Ahead of sentencing, Trump lashes out at judge and justice system",,Politics,MSNBC,3 min read,Donald Trump is poised to be sentenced in his hush money case — and the president-elect doesn’t appear to be taking the news well.,Steve Benen,2025-01-06T14:24:38.000Z,"During Donald Trump’s first presidential transition process, the Republican ran into an unfortunate legal mess: Just days after winning a first term, the then-president-elect faced a court date in a civil trail over his fraudulent Trump University scheme. He did, however, manage to avoid the embarrassment: After vowing to never settle the case out of court, Trump agreed to an out-of-court settlement in the fraud case. During his second presidential transition process, he’s facing an even more serious legal matter. It’s been roughly six months since a jury found Trump guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records as part of the Republican’s hush money scandal. It was the first time in American history in which a former president was found to have committed multiple felonies. Trump’s lawyers tried to overturn the verdict, pointing to the U.S. Supreme Court’s highly controversial immunity ruling. That didn’t work: Merchan concluded last month that the hush money payments that the president-elect made to Stormy Daniels had nothing to do with Trump’s “official acts” while in office. There was only one key step remaining. As my MSNBC colleague Jordan Rubin explained: Judge Juan Merchan rejected a motion from Donald Trump to dismiss the New York hush money case and set the president-elect’s sentencing for Jan. 10. Merchan said Trump can appear virtually or in person for the sentencing and the judge said he is not inclined to sentence Trump to prison. The 34 counts of falsifying business records for which Trump was found guilty at trial do not mandate incarceration. In theory, this appears to be an outcome the president-elect should like. Yes, he’ll be a convicted felon, but he doesn’t have to show up in court, and as a practical matter, he’ll hardly be punished at all. As Jordan’s piece added, “Merchan said a sentence of unconditional discharge ‘appears to be the most viable solution to ensure finality and allow Defendant to pursue his appellate options.’ Under New York law, a sentence of unconditional discharge is one imposed without imprisonment, fine or probation.” Still, sentencing will mean at least some accountability for the Republican — and he doesn’t appear to be taking this well. On Friday, after Merchan advanced the process, Trump began publishing a series of online tantrums, the first of which condemned the matter as “a nonexistent case,” an “illegitimate political attack” and “a Rigged Charade.” While most criminal defendants at least pretend to show some contrition ahead of sentencing, Trump lashed out at Merchan as “a radical partisan,” who’s engaged in “unlawful” misconduct. This was soon followed by another item, also published to his social media platform, in which the president-elect described the judge as “corrupt.” A day later, the Republican again called Merchan “corrupt”; mischaracterized the court-imposed gag order; and called for the New York judge’s disbarment. But the more hysterical Trump became, the more he widened the rage aperture. The president-elect proceeded to lash out at news organizations, Judge Arthur Engoron (whom he also described as “corrupt”), the “court system,” E. Jean Carroll, special counsel Jack Smith, and the Justice Department. And then he kept going. The Republican also condemned “corrupt Democrat [sic] judges and prosecutors,” the “evil and sinister” special counsel, President Joe Biden, and the “CORRUPT DOJ and FBI,” culminating in yet another online missive in which Trump peddled odd conspiracy theories, called Merchan a “HACK,” condemned his trial as a “sham,” accused the judge in the case of having “fabricated the facts.” If Trump is hoping that Merchan will see all of this and throw out the jury’s verdict, I have some bad news for the president-elect.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/biden-bans-water-heaters-know-131657628.html,Biden bans water heaters? What you should know before you hit the shower,,US,TCPalm | Treasure Coast Newspapers,5 min read,The Department of Energy estimated the costs saved over the long run by the new rules would be about $112 over 20 years.,"Cheryl McCloud, USA TODAY NETWORK - Florida",2025-01-06T13:16:57.000Z,"As Florida residents shivered in the blast of Arctic air, the Biden administration was busy over the weekend. Among the actions President Joe Biden took was to ban certain natural gas water heaters, a move many said could send prices soaring, especially for the elderly and the poor. Here's what you should know. Under the new ruling issued by outgoing President Joe Biden, new non-condensing, natural gas-fired water heaters would be prohibited for sale starting in 2029 due to concerns about carbon-dioxide emissions, according to the New York Post. If the policy takes effect, as it is slated to on March 11, a little less than 40% of the tankless water heaters currently on the market would be banned, according to an estimate from the Appliance Standards Awareness Project. The new rules, which were published by the Department of Energy in December 2024, also stipulate new tankless gas water heaters must rely on 13% less energy than the least efficient comparable model on the markets today. The intention is to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, which climate change advocates and Biden said cause global warming, according to Fox Business. The 361-page ruling issued by the Department of Energy set energy conservation standards for consumer gas-fired instantaneous water heaters. ""It has determined that the amended energy conservation standards for these products would result in significant conservation of energy, and are technologically feasible and economically justified,"" the agency said. ""Customers will be pushed toward  buying models that are more expensive or lean on non-instantaneous storage tank water heaters, which are generally cheaper but tend to be less efficient than the ones that are facing a ban,"" according to the New York Post. The new rules will require new tankless gas water heaters to use about 13% less energy than today’s least efficient tankless models, according to Fox Business. ""The rules apply to both non-condensing and condensing gas water heaters, but the rules increase efficiency requirements to a threshold that only condensing models can meet, effectively banning the cheaper but less efficient non-condensing models,"" according to The Washington Free Beacon. Condensing technology wastes less heat. Rinnai America's — which calls itself the leader in tankless technology — tankless non-condensing natural gas water heater goes for roughly $1,000 at Home Depot, while a comparable condensing 75-gallon tank goes for about $1,800. Tankless technology is frequently used in smaller apartments or housing spaces, which means that a lot of lower-income and elderly people tend to use those types of water heaters, according to the New York Post. “Forcing low-income and senior customers to pay far more upfront is particularly concerning. DOE’s decision to go ahead with a flawed final rule is deeply disappointing,” according to Matthew Agen, the American Gas Association’s chief counsel for energy. The Department of Energy estimated the costs saved over the long run by the new rules would be about $112 over a roughly 20-year stretch. Overall, under the regulations, roughly 40 percent of the new tankless water heaters available in the United States today would be taken off the market by 2029, the Washington Free Beacon reported. ""Experts and industry officials said that would force consumers to purchase either more expensive or less efficient water heater models. ""One industry analysis estimates that consumers will pay $450 more on average when purchasing new water heaters,"" according to the Free Beacon report. The Department of Energy estimated the new standards ""are projected to yield significant environmental benefits"" between 2030 and 2059, including reductions of: 32 million metric tons of carbon dioxide 0.12 thousand tons of sulfur dioxide 86 thousand tons of nitrogen oxide398 thousand tons of methane The Appliance Standards Awareness Project supported the new rule. “This is a commonsense step that will lower total household costs while reducing planet-warming emissions,” said Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project. According to its website, the Appliance Standards Awareness Project ""advocates for appliance, equipment, and lighting standards that cut planet-warming emissions and other air pollution, save water, and reduce economic and environmental burdens for low- and moderate-income households."" “These long-awaited standards will ensure more families save with proven energy-efficient technology already used in a majority of tankless units.” ➤ Appliance Standards Awareness Project Fact Sheet Critics said the ban on certain natural gas water heaters would increase energy costs for low-income and senior households, according to Fox Business. Matthew Agen, the American Gas Association’s chief counsel for energy, blasted the move, labeling it ""deeply concerning and irresponsible."" ""The DOE’s own analysis claims the average life-cycle cost savings would amount to barely $112 over the entire 20-year average product life,"" Agen added. ""It's one more example of an appliance regulation that raises costs and reduces choices,"" Ben Lieberman, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, told the Washington Free Beacon. ""It bans an entire category of tankless water heaters and the ones that are most affordable."" ""If you really want to impact the water heating ruling, you really need to deal with the tank models,"" Frank Windsor, the president of water heater manufacturer Rinnai America, told the Beacon.

Here's what to expect for the winter forecast over the next 24 hours.,"Lacey Latch and Danielle Camilli, Bucks County Courier Times",2025-01-06T13:16:12.000Z,"The snow from a large winter storm that could dump a foot of snow in its path made its way to Bucks County on Monday morning shortly after 7 a.m., and while we only see a few inches of accumulation the snow is set to linger here for most of the day. Most of the county is under a winter weather advisory until 10 p.m. Monday with officials warning of slippery road conditions and possible hazardous commutes. The storm is a large system impacting towns from Ohio to the Mid-Atlantic with reports of heavy snow and ice in some parts of the country. Bucks County will be spared from the worst of it, according to the National Weather Service. That largely depends on where in Bucks County you are and how the storm settles over the region. But, those in Lower Bucks County can expect the greatest chance of accumulating snow Monday. Parts of Bristol and Levittown could see 3 to 4 inches of snow, while parts north are in the 2 to 3 inch range, according to the National Weather Service advisory. Central and Upper Bucks County could see less with the chance of 1 to 2 inches. However, the weather service cautions, ""a small shift in the storm track could push higher totals either north of south."" Areas south of Bucks County, including the Jersey Shore, could see more snow with totals of up to 8 inches. Some areas in Delaware and Maryland could see a foot of snow, but Bucks is not under the same threat. ""Snow peaks in intensity Monday morning, but lingers through the evening,"" the weather service said about the timing of the storm. The snow started as forecasted while temperatures were about 26 degrees this morning. The storm is expected to bring snow throughout the day, closing nearly all schools in Bucks County and Philadelphia. The snow should taper off by late afternoon and into the evening. Historically, January and February are the most active months for snow fall in the Philadelphia area with an average of 7.1 inches and 8.4 inches, respectively, according to the National Weather Service. The cold will remain well after the snow moves out. ""The big story at least for the next week or so is going to be the cold,"" said Michael Silva, a meteorologist with the NWS. Temperatures in Philadelphia are forecast to be in the low-30s over the weekend and into next week, about 10 degrees below normal for this time of year, he said. These colder temperatures could in turn limit how much snow the area gets, he said, because colder temperatures usually result in a large high pressure area that suppresses the storms to the south. ""The next couple of weeks look like its going to be a bit active but it depends on how far north these systems can get that would impact how much snow we get,"" Silva said. During a snow related emergency in the community, specific ordinances go into effect including restricting parking within the township and ensuring residents who are clearing snow don't push it into the roadways. Municipalities ask residents to remove any vehicles prior to the start of the declaration. Vehicles found to be in violation and hindering plowing operations will be towed, officials said.

Reid said, “This milestone is a testament to the resilience, hard work, and innovation of cannabis entrepreneurs across New York. As $1 billion is an incredible number. Let us celebrate the individuals, businesses, and communities in cannabis who drive our state’s economic engine. Certainly, this moment underscores the strength of consumer demand for regulated cannabis—more importantly, it firmly demonstrates that a social and economic equity approach to industry is not antithetical to strong economic growth. New Yorkers have placed their trust in a market that prioritizes equity — and OCM remains committed to supporting that mission.” Cannabis Control Board Chairwoman Tremaine Wright said, “The tax revenue generated by this thriving industry directly supports our Community Reinvestment Grant Program, ensuring that communities disproportionately impacted by cannabis prohibition receive critical investments. This is only the beginning of what’s possible when we invest in an inclusive and well-regulated industry.” According to the OCM Annual Report, more than 5,250 licenses, permits and registrations were issued or provisionally approved in state fiscal years 2023-2024 and 2024-2025.

Airlines are offering travel waivers.","Josh Rivera, USA TODAY",2025-01-06T13:10:01.000Z,"That massive winter storm that dumped feet of snow across the Midwest over the weekend has made its way to the Mid-Atlantic – and it’s not messing around. By Monday, roads turned treacherous, schools were shutting down left and right, and airports were scrambling to keep up with a growing list of cancellations. Even federal offices closed their doors, leaving everyone bracing for a messy few days ahead. More than 1,400 U.S. flights have been canceled, and more than 870 others have been delayed as of 8 a.m. ET, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware. Southwest and American Airlines have been hit the hardest, with 9% and 5% of their scheduled flights canceled, respectively. Airlines urge travelers to check flight statuses before heading to the airport, and some have issued waivers for changes or cancellations due to weather concerns. Weather waivers vary by airline, so be sure to check the details for yours below. Note that most waivers only apply to select airports and the rescheduled travel date is usually required to be near the original. Alaska Airlines: Waiver for those traveling at select airports American Airlines: Waiver for those traveling Jan. 4-6 Delta Air Lines: Waiver for those traveling Jan. 6 Frontier Airlines: Waiver for those traveling Jan. 5-6 JetBlue Airways: Waiver for those traveling Jan. 4-6 Southwest Airlines: Waiver for those traveling Jan. 4-6 United Airlines: Waiver for those traveling Jan. 5-6 The Department of Transportation created a dashboard for travelers to have easy access to information about services that U.S. airlines provide in the case of cancellations or delays. Click here to access the DOT Cancellation and Delay Dashboard. A new rule from the DOT that went into effect at the end of October requires airlines to refund passengers if their flight is significantly delayed for reasons within the carrier's control and also makes airlines more responsible for following their own customer commitments in those cases. The DOT defines a significant delay as a departure or arrival that is three hours late or more for a domestic flight, or six hours late or more for an international flight. According to the DOT, a controllable delay is one caused by the airline itself. Controllable reasons include maintenance or crew problems, cabin cleaning, baggage loading and fueling. Things like weather or air traffic control flow programs do not count against the airline. If your flight is delayed significantly for a reason in the airline's control, you are entitled to a refund if you choose not to travel. If you decide to stick it out, you may still be entitled to some compensation or accommodation, including rebooking on another flight or airline at no cost, meal and lodging vouchers for qualifying delays, and other benefits. No U.S. airlines currently offer cash compensation for delays, but the big four (American, Delta, Southwest and United) all offer hotel and ground transportation vouchers for overnight delays. The DOT has a dashboard that outlines all major U.S. airlines' policies. Your best bet is to know your airline's policies before your trip and be your own advocate. Get in touch with the airline however you can, whether it's through the app, through social media, by phone or at the airport help desk if you're already on your way. It's usually a good idea to have some alternative flights in mind when you speak to an agent, and be sure to ask for any accommodation or refunds you may be entitled to if you plan to take advantage of those policies.

Here's how to stay safe in the ice and snow.,"John Tufts and Jenny Porter Tilley, USA TODAY NETWORK",2025-01-06T13:04:54.000Z,"What's the best way to drive in snow and ice? Don't. That's ideal, but not always possible. With more than 7 inches of snowfall recorded for Louisville and more to come on Monday, some commuters might still need to be on the road. Before you scrape the ice off your windshield and get into your vehicle, you might want to check if road conditions are safe. Here's how to do that in Kentucky and how to stay safe if you have to drive. Live updates: Louisville remains under winter storm warning Monday Find the latest traffic alerts from the Kentucky Office of Highway Safety at goky.ky.gov. The Louisville/Jefferson County Information Consortium maintains a map showing which roads are on the metro snow route and which have been plowed and salted. View it at apps.lojic.org/metrosnowroutes. Don't be a jerk (no, really). The key to safe driving when there's ice on the road, writes Car And Driver Magazine, is operating the steering wheel, accelerator and brakes as smoothly as possible. Jerky movements — twisting the wheel suddenly or slamming your foot on the brake or gas pedal — can throw your vehicle into a skid. Above all, keep the following in mind when driving through snowy, icy weather: 👀 Stay alert ⚠️Reduce your speed 🚨Watch for brake lights ahead of your from other vehicles ↔️ Leave more space between cars If your vehicle begins to go into a skid on an icy road, do the following: Take your foot off the accelerator and do not slam the brakes. Look at the direction you want to go, not where your car is headed. For a front-wheel skid, writes Car and Driver Magazine, aim your vehicle where you want to go. Gently turn the steering wheel into the direction of the skid. If you're in a rear-wheel skid — where the rear tires lose traction and you feel yourself spinning out — turn the steering wheel in the same direction that the rear is sliding. For example, if your rear wheels are sliding to the left, turn the wheel to the left. Tap the brakes, lightly, when necessary to self-correct out of the skid. Kentucky road conditions: What are road conditions in Louisville Monday? Traffic updates, winter storm driving tips Staying safe on Indiana's roads during a winter storm can depend largely on how well you're prepared. The Indiana Department of Transportation offers these tips: Knowledge: Before leaving home, find out about the driving conditions. Safe drivers know the weather, and their limits. If the weather is bad remember, ""ice and snow, take it slow,"" or just don’t go. Clear: Remove any snow on your vehicle’s windows, lights, brake lights and signals. Make sure you can see and be seen. Inspect: Check your vehicle’s tires, wiper blades, fluids, lights, belts and hoses. A breakdown is bad on a good day and dangerous on a bad-weather day. Time: Leave plenty of time to reach your destination safely. It’s not worth putting yourself and others in a dangerous situation just to be on time. Kit: Keep a basic winter survival kit in your vehicle, including a flashlight, batteries, blanket, snacks, water, gloves, boots, and a first-aid kit. Load your car with winter travel gear, including tire chains, ice scraper/snowbrush, jumper cables and road flares. 🚨 Indiana Weather Alerts: Warnings, Watches and Advisories. ⚡ Indiana power outage map: How to check your status. 💻 Internet outages: How to track them. 🚫 What you should and shouldn't do when the power is out. 🐶 Your neighbor left their pet outside. Who you should call. 🏠 It's cold outside! Where to find shelter. .

""I got a flight to catch. Why is this thing going in a circle? I'm getting dizzy,"" passenger Mike Johns said in the video posted in December 2024. ""It's circling around a parking lot. I got my seatbelt on. I can't get out the car. Has this been hacked? What's going on? I feel like I'm in the movies,"" Johns told the customer support representative. The representative asked Johns to open his Waymo app. Johns then asked her to take over the car, saying, ""Can't you just do it? You should be able to handle it."" The representative, however, told Johns that she did not ""have an option to control"" the car and that she was trying to pull the car over. Alongside the video posted to LinkedIn, Johns wrote that the driverless car circled eight times and that he missed his flight. ""Next I'll keep it old fashion and just #Lyft or #Uber,"" Johns wrote. Johns is from Los Angeles and works in technology, media, entertainment and politics, according to his LinkedIn profile. According to Waymo, the incident delayed Johns by just over five minutes, and he was not charged for the trip. Waymo said the event occurred in the Phoenix area in mid-December and has since been addressed by a software update. After the incident, the autonomous vehicle drove Johns to Sky Harbor, according to Waymo. Waymo attempted to contact Johns and left a voicemail for follow-up, according to a spokesperson. Phoenix is one of three U.S. cities serviced by Waymo's ride-hailing service, Waymo One.

The six patients, who are in their 20s and 30s, are in critical condition and have burns covering 60% to 80% of their bodies, said Valleywise Health chief clinical officer Dr. Michael White. White said all six have a good chance of survival and that Valleywise Health does not expect more patients to be flown in. Hawaii's only burn center is located on Oahu where the incident took place, but beds are limited. White said the Diane and Bruce Halle Arizona Burn Center in Phoenix, Arizona's only burn center and one of the largest in the country, has the ability to help. ""When the call is made, we're more than happy, if we have the capacity and expertise, to help these patients,"" White said. According to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, the six were chosen due to the severity of traumatic injuries and burns sustained during the incident. Green authorized a C-17 military transport to fly them into Phoenix and it arrived at Sky Harbor International Airport around 8:30 p.m. Saturday. On X, Phoenix mayor Kate Gallego applauded Phoenix Fire's efforts to transport the patients from Sky Harbor. Among those flown into Arizona was a mother of a 3-month-old. On the cusp of New Year's Day, three people died and over 20 were injured from a firework explosion around midnight in the Aliamanu, also known as the Salt Lake, neighborhood near Pearl Harbor and Honolulu on Hawaii's third largest island. In a Jan. 1 press conference from the Honolulu Police Department, authorities said a person lit a firework ""cake"" containing around 50 individual aerial fireworks that somehow tipped over, shooting into other crates also filled with fireworks and resulting in the fatal explosion. Authorities estimated fireworks recovered at the scene cost tens of thousands of dollars. ""It looked like a war zone,"" Honolulu Fire Chief Sheldon Hao said during the press conference. Videos posted on social media appear to show dozens of fireworks exploding in a massive, bright blaze, with plumes of smoke rising in the air. The blast appeared to explode on a resident's front lawn, along a dense neighborhood street dotted with parked cars. Twenty-three adults and three children were seriously and critically injured in the explosion, though the estimate does not account for those who admitted themselves into the hospital, authorities said. Two women died at the scene and a third passed away a few hours later. ""Make no mistake, it was a bomb ... it was a firework bomb,"" Gov. Green said. Most people injured sustained burns, but injuries also included those caused by shrapnel that were ""gruesome,"" said Honolulu Emergency Services Department director Dr. Jim Ireland at the press conference. Honolulu police said the person who lit the fireworks, as well as those who potentially supplied the illegal ones, may face criminal prosecution pending the investigation. A fourth person died due to an unrelated firework incident in the Kalihi area about six miles away. Fireworks are fundamentally dangerous, Dr. White from Valleywise Health noted. ""They are explosive devices. (There's) risk for burns and risk for injuries such as this,"" he said. In Phoenix, any firework that is designed to shoot off the ground is illegal and can carry a misdemeanor charge, fines or jail time, according to Sgt. Brian Bower with Phoenix police. Fines for illegal fireworks vary per city: Avondale: $1,000. Chandler: $1,000. Gilbert: $1,000. Glendale: $1,500 on first offense, $2,000 on second offense. Goodyear: $1,000.

Here's how to recycle your trees.,,US,Austin American-Statesman,4 min read,"With the free program, Texas Disposal Systems and city of Austin turn living Christmas trees and other living decor into organic mulch and compost.","Karoline Leonard, Austin American-Statesman",2025-01-06T13:02:49.000Z,"Have a real Christmas tree and don’t know what to do with it? Central Texas residents can recycle their Christmas trees and other living holiday decor at several locations throughout the city of Austin and Travis County and with private vendors such as Texas Disposal Systems free of charge. Various programs will repurpose the decor, turning it into mulch or fertilizer and giving it a second life. The goal of many of these programs is to reduce waste and space in landfills, according to Jennifer Dudley, a spokesperson for Texas Disposal Systems. “It's very important to reduce what is being sent to the landfill, so anything that we can divert is very helpful to the environment and to the earth,"" Dudley said. ""With all the resolutions that everyone's making right now and the intentions that people are setting, being sustainable is not usually at the top of everyone's list. But it's such an easy thing to do, and I think doing this one small thing can make a really big difference in the community.” Trees and decorations must not be artificial and must be unflocked, meaning they cannot be covered in a layer of artificial snow or frosting. They also need to be free of lights, ornaments, metal and nonliving contaminants to be recycled at most locations. Some drop-off locations will charge fees for contaminated items. Here's how to recycle your tree after the holidays: Austin residents with curbside recycling and composting collection services can leave their Christmas trees on the curb to be picked up. Trees must be set out by 5:30 a.m. on the composting collection day. All contaminants — ornaments, lights, tinsel, tree stands and other decorations — need to be removed for the trees to be accepted. Trees also cannot be covered in artificial snow or frosting. Trees 6 feet or taller need to be cut in half. The city had in-person drop-off days at Zilker Park, but that ended Sunday. Trees left at Zilker Park are turned into mulch that residents can pick up for free on a first-come, first-served basis starting at 9 a.m. Wednesday, weather permitting. Customers must bring their own tools and storage containers. Several third-party vendors also accept trees in the Austin area: The Hornsby Bend Biosolids Management Plant at 2210 FM 973 in Austin. Whittlesey Landscape Supplies at 629 Dalton Lane in Austin. Kinser Ranch LLC at 10701 Kinser Lane in Austin. The Travis County West Service Center at 4501 RM 620 in Austin. The Travis County East Service Center at 6011 Blue Bluff Road in Austin. For retailers with 10 or more trees, the Travis County West Service Center and the Travis County East Service Center will accept bulk drop-offs, but an appointment is required. To know more about how to recycle with the city, go to the city of Austin's webpage. Through Jan. 31, Central Texas residents can recycle their Christmas trees and other living holiday decor at a Texas Disposal Systems drop-off location free of charge. Texas Disposal Systems is a family-owned disposal company that focuses on diverting waste to beneficial uses. With the free program, the company will turn living Christmas trees, holly, wreaths, pumpkins and other living decorations into organic mulch and compost that can be purchased at its Garden-Ville stores. For residents in jurisdictions with TDS green waste service, the company will pick up the trees and other items on the curb. It charges a $55 fee for contaminated items. TDS has six collection sites in the greater Austin and San Antonio areas: TDS Landfill at 3016 FM 1327 in Creedmoor. TDS and Garden-Ville at 4001 S. RM 620 in Bee Cave.

Here's what to try in 2025,,Lifestyle,AZCentral | The Arizona Republic,5 min read,"Whether you're looking to get into hiking or baking, there are plenty of things to check out in the Arizona cities of Goodyear and Buckeye in 2025.","Alexandra Hardle, Arizona Republic",2025-01-06T13:02:16.000Z,"It's a new year, and what better way to celebrate than by trying new local spots? The West Valley's fast population growth is bringing an influx of new restaurants and retailers. Goodyear's population is now estimated to be at nearly 117,000 — up from 95,000 in 2020 — while Buckeye's population is now at an estimated 112,000, an increase from 91,500 in 2020. That means nearly 45,000 more people are living just in those two cities, and cities and businesses are working to keep up with the growth. If your New Year's resolution is to try new things, here are five to try out in Goodyear and Buckeye in 2025. Just about anything you might associate with sourdough can be bought from Dough Bros, a small business out of Buckeye. Orders can be placed on the bakery's website for items such as sourdough dinner rolls to sourdough butter pecan cinnamon rolls to cheddar-cheese stuffed sourdough bread with everything bagel seasoning. Dough Bros also offers starters for those who want to make their own sourdough. And if you don't know where to start, Dough Bros offers sourdough baking classes for beginners, as well as advanced sourdough baking classes. Classes are $100 per person and take place at La Placita Cafe, located at 424 E. Monroe Ave. in Buckeye. Classes run from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. on select Saturdays through April, including Jan. 11., Feb. 1 and Feb. 8, as well as an advanced class on Jan. 25. There's also a cinnamon roll class on Jan. 18. Classes are taught by Sourdough Bros owner Kylee Ruark. Those who attend the beginner class will leave with a proofing basket, stirring utensil and a sourdough starter.

Verrado Marketplace, Teravalis: Key Buckeye developments to look for in 2025 If your New Year's resolution is to get more exercise, now is the perfect time to pick up hiking before the weather heats up. The West Valley has no shortage of hiking trails. Until May, Estrella Mountain Regional Park is open from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m., with those hours extending during the summer months. The park has nearly 20,000 acres of desert and mountains. The park is a good place for biking, camping, fishing at the Gila River and even horseback riding. The park has more than 33 miles of trails that range in length and difficulty. The shortest trail is 2.4 miles, while the longest is 8.8 miles. The park is accessible off of Interstate 10 at the Estrella Parkway exit. The park entrance can be reached after traveling east on Vineyard Avenue. Melissa Calles, a photographer and co-owner of West Streets studio, came up with the idea for a market that would serve as a First Friday event for West Valley residents. At the same time, the market spotlights local vendors and businesses. The Buckeye Night Market takes place on the first Friday of every month through April from 6 to 9 p.m. at Sixth Street Plaza in downtown Buckeye. The event is pet-friendly and features a number of rotating local vendors. Products available at the market include jewelry, clothes, skin care, candles, flower arrangements and food and drinks from local businesses. Because Calles received so many applications from interested vendors, businesses may vary from month to month, although there's always a new business to check out. Things to do: We can't wait to try these restaurants opening in metro Phoenix in 2025 If it seems new restaurants are popping up almost constantly at GSQ at Goodyear, that might be because they are. Most recently, the city celebrated the grand opening of the Bacchus Wine Bar on Dec. 27. Bacchus Wine is locally owned and operated, and it is located at 1975 North Globe Dr., Suite 107. Goodyear has been rolling out a number of new restaurants and retailers as it builds its downtown area from scratch. Other recent openings include Spitz Mediterranean Food, the Stillery and Copper & Sage. And the openings don't stop there: GSQ is expecting a number of new restaurants to open in the new year, including celebrity-owned Dave's Hot Chicken and High Tide Seafood Bar and Grill. The New Year means it's nearly time for spring training. And watching a game is a must, with spring training only taking place in Arizona and Florida. Workouts are expected to kick off in February. While you can catch a game at various stadiums throughout the Valley, Goodyear's stadium is home to the Cincinnati Reds and the Cleveland Guardians. The Cactus League brings more than 130,000 visitors to the city every year. The area surrounding the ballpark also is ever-evolving, with new restaurants and things to do. At the nearby intersection of McDowell Road and Pebble Creek Parkway, baseball watchers and residents can find a variety of different restaurants, including sit-down restaurants like Red Lobster and Texas Roadhouse and drive-through joints. Just north of the ballpark are a variety of spots, such as the vegan restaurant Bereisheet 129 and N-DUB Pizza Pub. Reach the reporter at ahardle@gannett.com or by phone at 480-708-1633.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/feds-mexican-gray-wolf-recovery-130204928.html,"Feds say Mexican gray wolf recovery is on track, but advocates see 'significant setbacks'",,US,AZCentral | The Arizona Republic,7 min read,"As government agencies reach targets in endangered wolf recovery, five-year evaluation of the binational program reveals troubles in Mexico.","John Leos, Arizona Republic",2025-01-06T13:02:04.000Z,"A five-year evaluation of the binational Mexican gray wolf recovery program reveals a stark contrast between the recovery programs in the United States and Mexico. Federal officials lauded the U.S. program for surpassing recovery goals, but wolf advocacy groups are decrying the report for downplaying the status of wolves in Mexico. The five-year evaluation, released last month by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, is an assessment of the government's progress towards the goals outlined in a 2017 revision of the Mexican Wolf Recovery Plan. The program seeks to establish two resilient populations of the endangered wolves, one in the southwestern United States and one in Mexico. Between 2017 and 2022, state and federal agencies in Arizona and New Mexico managing the U.S. program surpassed targeted population and release goals. “This progress report shows we are ahead of where we anticipated being in achieving our recovery goals in the United States for Mexican wolves,” said Brady McGee, Mexican Wolf recovery coordinator for U.S. Fish and Wildlife in a news release. “Since its inception, this program has strived to adjust and adapt our efforts to maximize success for recovery of this subspecies. This evaluation is evidence that what we are doing is working and provides a chance to reflect and shift as needed.” In Mexico, the program did not meet either goal, recording only 35 wolves for a minimum population goal of 100 and nine releases for a target goal of 25. “This is lipstick on a pig,” said Chris Smith, wildlife program director for WildEarth Guardians, in a news release from wolf advocacy groups in response to the evaluation. ""Credit is due for the successes of the recovery program. But this report glosses over significant setbacks and real threats to recovery. There is no functional wolf population in Mexico; there may be no wolves in Mexico at all.” The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service did not respond directly to the criticism from the advocacy groups but stated its intention to continue working with the Mexican government on their wolf recovery efforts. ""The Service values our work with Mexico, and we will continue to collaborate on the future of the Mexican wolf,"" said Brent Lawrence, a communications specialist for U.S. Fish and Wildlife. In the evaluation, the federal agency identified specific actions from the binational recovery plan to aid the Mexico program, including exploring new sites for wolf introduction and increasing the number of translocated wolves. As of 2023, however, the agency was unable to report an estimated population in the report. ""While Mexican wolf sightings continue to be reported in Mexico, we do not have an estimated minimum count for 2023,"" the U.S. Fish and Wildlife said in a written statement, ""and Mexico has reported zero collared wolves alive in the wild in 2023."" As the Mexico program struggles to establish a viable population, wolf advocacy groups say U.S. agencies are not doing enough to bolster the American population by increasing available habitat and taking action against preventable deaths. Imperiled species: Fate of Mexican gray wolves is caught in a battle over their place in the landscape The Mexican gray wolf, or lobo, is a subspecies of gray wolf that is smaller and genetically distinct from the larger gray wolf species in the northern Rocky Mountains. In 1976, Mexican gray wolves were listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act following the near eradication of the species for livestock predator control. A minimum population of 252 Mexican gray wolves was counted in the United States in 2022, surpassing the recovery plan’s target goal by almost 100 wolves. Despite this success, a major impediment for the U.S. program is human-caused mortalities in the form of shootings or vehicle collisions. Although killing a wolf is a violation of federal law, the report states: “Illegal mortality is the highest source of Mexican wolf mortality.” Government agencies have made efforts to educate the public through extensive outreach and hunter education programs, but wolf advocates are calling for more law enforcement and increased prosecution when a wolf is killed. Of the 61 suspected illegal deaths caused between 2017 and 2022, only two were federally prosecuted and three were fined, according to the evaluation. “If people know they can get away with killing a Mexican gray wolf, there's no incentive to not kill them,” said Cyndi Tuell, Arizona and New Mexico director of Western Watersheds Project. “There's just no accountability for when people kill the wolves. And that's a huge problem.” In Mexico, wolf mortality is almost exclusively related to humans, with 39 deaths between 2011 and 2023 attributed to poisoning or human-caused unknown deaths. According to the evaluation, Mexico has reported that no wolves are currently wearing tracking collars in the wild mostly due to the illegal poisoning. Pushing southward: Two Mexican gray wolves are released in southern Arizona's Sky Islands The current population of Mexican gray wolves is descended from seven surviving wolves used to start a binational captive breeding program in the 1980s and 1990s. This small genetic pool makes the wolves susceptible to problems caused by inbreeding. The current Mexican Wolf Recovery Program calls for the establishment of two genetically diverse populations, one in Mexico and one in the United States. As the Mexico program struggles, some advocates are pushing for the U.S. government to expand the wolf habitat and establish new populations northward. Currently, the U.S. program manages wolves inside of a designated reintroduction area known as the Mexican Wolf Experimental Population Area, or MWEPA. Established in 1998, the current MWEPA includes all land in Arizona and New Mexico south of Interstate 40. ""There is abundant vacant habitat in Arizona, New Mexico, and old Mexico,"" Jim deVos, Mexican wolf coordinator for Arizona Game and Fish, told The Republic earlier this year. ""We've been able to reduce the number of human-caused mortalities in the recovery area by making the effort to keep people informed."" Government agencies consider this area the historic range of the species, but wolf advocacy groups have challenged this boundary as impeding on the natural dispersal of wolf population. “The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service continues to focus its recovery efforts within the Mexican Wolf Experimental Population Area (MWEPA), ignoring the critical needs of dispersing wolves and failing to acknowledge that suitable habitat exists beyond this artificial boundary,” said Claire Musser, executive director of the Grand Canyon Wolf Recovery Project, in a news release. “True recovery requires a plan that works with the wolves, not against them, ensuring their survival and ecological contributions outside the arbitrary boundary of Interstate 40.” In recent years, Mexican wolves that have wandered north of I-40 have been killed or relocated. In 2021, a male wolf known as Anubis wandered across the freeway before being shot near Flagstaff in 2022. Another wolf, known as Asha, crossed the boundary twice in 2022 and again in 2023 before being relocated to a conservation center in New Mexico. In 2024, a pair of Mexican gray wolves, known as the Kendrick Peak Pack, was discovered near Flagstaff. As wildlife managers attempted to capture and relocate the animals back to the MWEPA, one of the wolves was found dead in November. An investigation into the death is ongoing. Wildlife managers insist that the species is most protected within the management area and the close proximity to other wolves will lead to increased breeding and genetic mixing, but advocacy groups have continued to pressure state and federal agencies to allow the wolves to establish in their preferred habitat. “We really want them to start letting wolves live north of I-40, where they're showing us that the habitat is really great for them. That's happened in both Arizona and New Mexico,” said Tuell of Western Watersheds Project. “The wolves are showing us where to go, we just need to listen.” John Leos covers environmental issues for The Arizona Republic and azcentral.

The CNN poll does show that, but the picture is muddier when you look at other polls.","D.L. Davis, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel",2025-01-06T13:01:59.000Z,"President-elect Donald Trump won Wisconsin by nearly 30,000 votes after losing the state four years ago by some 20,000 votes, but did he really win 18-24-year-olds in the state? There have been a lot of different takes on how Trump took the state over Vice President Kamala Harris, but one in particular caught our eye: “Trump won 18-24 year olds in Wisconsin,” according to a Dec. 1, 2024, X post from Luc J. Gagnon@LakePoliticsYT.  Gagnon, according to his profile, is a “progressive Republican” and “ballot chaser” for Turning Point Action and Republican Party of Milwaukee County. The claim piqued PolitiFact Wisconsin’s interest because four years earlier, in 2020, in Wisconsin, 14% of all votes cast came from young voters, ages 18-29. Of these, 58% supported Joe Biden, while 39% backed Donald Trump, according to the CIRCLE, which also estimated that young people turned out at a higher rate in 2020 than in 2016. The impact of that demographic, especially youth of color’s support for Biden, was decisive in races across the country, according to the CIRCLE (the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement), which describes itself as a non-partisan, independent research organization focused on youth civic engagement. In his post Gagnon included a table showing Trump winning 50% of the 18-24 year old vote in Wisconsin, while Harris received 48%. Gagnon did not provide a source for his figures, and attempts to reach him for comment were not successful. However, a quick Google search finds that the figures originate from a Nov. 19, 2024, CNN exit poll. Gagnon’s social media post garnered 80.9K views and 2.1K likes on X. Thus, we are attributing the claim to social media for purposes of this fact check. Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll, noting the figures were from CNN exit polling, pointed out that the post skipped the first age table for Wisconsin voters, which looks at a slightly different demographic: 18-to-29-year-old Wisconsin voters. A closer look at that group shows Harris at 49% and Trump at 48%. The post instead goes for the narrower second one, 18-24, which indeed had Trump at 50% and Harris at 48%. Franklin also pointed out that there is a quite different result from the data provided by AP-Votecast, which is used by Fox News. That data show a strong Harris win among 18-29-year-olds -- 61% to 38% -- but did not provide a breakdown for 18-24 year olds. “Which of these is ‘right’ is difficult to know,” Franklin said in an email. “Exit polls and the AP Votecast, are attempts to capture voter behavior at the moment of the election, but like all polls they are subject to sampling variability and to non-response issues. For small groups of the electorate (9% to 14% in this case in both polls) the potential for both sampling variation and non-response issues is greater than for larger groups.” In other words, the smaller the group examined, the greater the margin of error. NORC is a nonprofit research organization at the University of Chicago that conducts a survey used by the Associated Press and Fox News under the brand AP VoteCast, which debuted in 2018. NBC News in explaining how exit polls work, says that since 2003, Edison Research, a firm that specializes in collecting election data, has conducted exit polls on behalf of the National Election Pool. The NEP is a consortium of media networks — ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC News — that pools together resources for one collective vote count and exit poll operation. In the coming weeks and months there will be surveys from shortly after the election that are matched to the state voter files to give a measure of people who actually voted in the election, and their survey responses, Franklin said. Barry C. Burden, University of Wisconsin-Madison professor of political science and director of the university’s Elections Research Center, said there is not sufficiently reliable data to conclude which candidate got more votes among young people — or any other age group – in Wisconsin. “Exit polls such as the one Gagnon references are the most immediate source for understanding how groups voted in the election, so they are widely used to explore voting patterns,” Burden said in an email. “But exit polls are known to have systematic errors, especially for estimating vote choices in subgroups such as 18-24 year olds, who make up a small share of the sample and can be a difficult group to survey. There is also a margin of error to consider, as in any other survey. As a result, it is not reasonable to conclude at this point that Trump won over young voters in Wisconsin.” Burden said more high-quality data analysis will not emerge until early 2025 because it simply takes time to gather data in more scientific surveys or to use official state voter data to estimate how individuals voted. “At most we can conclude from exit polls that the vote choices of young voters in Wisconsin were probably more evenly divided between the parties than in recent elections,” Burden said. A Wisconsin Public Radio report also noted that Trump made big gains in voting wards around universities, according to data compiled by Marquette University researcher John Johnson. For example, WPR said, in four wards around the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, Biden beat Trump by over 1,000 votes in 2020. This year, with over 4,000 votes cast, Harris eked out a mere 77-vote win. Also, WPR reported, Trump more than doubled his vote count in seven student-populated wards around Marquette University. He diminished Democrats’ winning margin there from 62% to 38%. A social media post said “Trump won 18-24 year olds in Wisconsin.” A CNN exit poll does indeed show Trump winning that age group over Harris 50% to 48%.  The CNN poll does show that, but the picture is muddier when you look at other polls, slightly wider groups and consider that the polls themselves have a wide margin of error for what amounts to a small slice of the electorate. Indeed, that same poll shows a different outcome when the demographic range is widened to ages 18-29, which shows Harris over Trump 49% to 48%. And looking at AP Votecast figures quoted by Fox News, Harris won 18-29-year-old Wisconsin voters at 61% while Trump received 38% of that demographic. Elections experts say exit polls are known to have systematic errors, and more time is needed for high quality data analysis to determine a better understanding of how Wisconsin’s young people voted in the election. Still, those polls are the best information we have at this time and the post quoted the poll accurately. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate the post as Half True. X, Luc J.

Photo by Minnesota House Public Information Services. Editor’s note: This is the third installment in the Reformer’s series introducing readers to the 22 new Minnesota House members and one state senator. Read our first and second installment. A judge last month ruled that Rep.-elect Curtis Johnson didn’t live in his district and was therefore ineligible to serve, meaning that lawmakers will gavel into the session on Jan. 14 with Republicans holding the majority, 67-66, at least temporarily until a special election. Because of the power dynamics, each new member can wield considerable influence not typically seen among freshman legislators. New members typically follow the lead of their caucus, as they are still learning how the Capitol operates. But this year, new members can withhold their vote and gum up the entire caucus agenda. The Reformer reached out to all 22 new members (including Johnson). Reps. Tom Dippel and Alex Falconer spoke with the Reformer for this installment; the others either participated in previous editions or did not respond to requests for comment. Tom Dippel owns a dental manufacturing company, and he’s a board member and co-founder of Valor Classical Academy, a private K-12 school in Woodbury that teaches students a classical, liberal arts education also grounded in Christianity. Dippel, who will represent House District 41B, said he ran for office because he grew up around the Cottage Grove area, and he wanted to give back to the community. His top issues include clean water for the Hastings-Cottage Grove area, where much of the water supply has been contaminated with per and poly-fluoroalkyl substances — known as PFAS — created by 3M. Dippel, 42, said he’s working on a bill to fund water filtration facilities at Hastings’ city wells. Some of Hastings’ wells were not included in 3M’s $850 million settlement to clean up contaminants, so Dippel said he’s hoping the state can step in to help the city. Dippel said clean water should be a bipartisan issue, though he also expects to clash with Democrats on the state budget. “The budget was raised in an extreme way and we see what happens, what the aftermath and fallout of those kinds of somewhat irresponsible policy making decisions are,” Dippel said, adding that he hopes Democrats can work with Republicans to make life more affordable for Minnesotans. In his free time, Dippel likes to hunt, and he listens to audiobooks at 1.75 times or double the speed. Alex Falconer is the campaign manager for Save the Boundary Waters, an advocacy organization that works to protect the Boundary Waters Canoe Area from mining. Falconer, who will represent House District 49A, has long been involved in DFL politics and has managed several congressional campaigns. He said he’s looking forward to proposing solutions from inside the Legislature. His top issues include protecting the Boundary Waters, ensuring students receive a quality education and lowering the price of health care for families. Falconer, 44, said he’s also excited to get to know his fellow lawmakers and learn where they can find common ground to pass bipartisan legislation. “I’m hoping for a general temperature reset that people can go to the Legislature with cooler heads, expecting that by the very nature of the session, we are going to have to work together and just get to know people,” he said. A few years ago, Falconer combined two of his interests, running 110 miles across the Boundary Waters in 38 hours and 15 minutes. Erica Schwartz works for her husband’s business, the Nicollet Mart, a local convenience store and gas station. Schwartz declined the Reformer’s request for an interview. According to her campaign site, Schwartz was diagnosed with a brain tumor during her senior year of high school and worked as a single mother. Schwartz will represent House District 18A, which includes part of Mankato, North Mankato, Kasota and St. Peter. She beat DFL Rep. Jeff Brand by three percentage points. Schwartz focused on local issues and mostly stayed away from national politics, the Star Tribune reported. She said she’s seen people struggling to pay for food at her convenience store, the Strib reported. In audio obtained by the Reformer, Schwartz once insinuated during a Republican fundraiser that Democrats are pushing the country toward the conditions that led to the Holocaust. She later apologized, saying she made an “inartful comment trying to highlight some of the reasons I ran for office: my deep concern about the one-party control in Minnesota, and the increasingly hostile political environment where free speech is under attack and Americans are divided against each other.” Terry Stier is the chief of police for Belle Plaine, and he’s married to Le Sueur police chief Pilar Stier, the state’s first Latina police chief. Stier, who didn’t respond to the Reformer’s requests for an interview, will represent House District 22B, which includes Le Sueur, New Prague, Waterville and Belle Plaine. Stier also serves as a board member of the Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association. In an interview with House Public Information Services, Stier said he ran for office because of increased vitriol against law enforcement. “The attacks on public safety have caused a lot of turmoil within law enforcement. We’re facing recruiting, retention issues across the state, and I think I can either talk in a coffee shop about what we can do to fix it, or I can step up and actually do something,” Stier said. Stier said his constituents are tired of political polarization and would like to see Minnesota lawmakers come to the middle to get bipartisan legislation passed. Drew Roach, a self-described “constitutional conservative,” is a small-business owner who was elected to replace longtime Rep. Pat Garofalo. Roach is also an election conspiracy theorist who once got into a brawl with the son of a Rosemount city councilwoman. Roach was trying to serve papers at her house to notify her of a lawsuit to try to stop an upcoming primary election. Roach was charged with disorderly conduct after an altercation with the councilwoman’s son. Roach, who didn’t respond to the Reformer’s requests for an interview, will represent House District 58B, which includes Rosemount, Vermillion, Farmington and Dennison. In an interview with House Public Information Services, Roach said he’s not a politician. “I’m just a regular, blue-collar guy,” Roach said. “I’m an outsider-type candidate … We needed somebody to represent the community with some strong conservative values, and so I made the leap.” He said his priorities include promoting private school vouchers, getting parents more involved in their children’s education, lowering taxes and protecting 2nd Amendment rights. Thomas Sexton is a retired U.S. Air Force colonel and helicopter pilot. Sexton, who didn’t respond to the Reformer’s requests for an interview, will represent House District 19B, which includes Owatonna, Medford and Waseca. In an interview with House Public Information Services, Sexton said he declined to run for office twice in the past, but after enough encouragement he decided to run. Sexton said the number one thing he heard from voters while door-knocking was that they want to see politicians get along. His top legislative priority will be public safety. “We’re 1,000 officers short across the state,” Sexton said. “With my military background, I realize that people are not coming into the career field. Eventually that catches up with us, and it’s very hard to replace,” Sexton told House Public Information Services.",0,[],2025-01-06 13:50:29,2025-01-06 21:30:29
https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-promised-pardons-january-6-130033669.html,Trump promised pardons for January 6 rioters in ‘first hour’ of his second term. What might this mean?,,Politics,The Guardian,7 min read,Observers raise alarm about how pardons for convicted Capitol attackers might weaken US criminal justice system,Martin Pengelly in Washington,2025-01-06T13:00:33.000Z,"As Donald Trump prepares to return to the White House, politicians, legal observers and even sitting federal judges are expressing alarm about his stated intention to pardon or offer commutations to supporters who attacked the US Capitol on 6 January 2021 and were then convicted of crimes. Clemency for those who sought to block certification of Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory “would undermine the US judiciary and criminal justice system and send a message to Americans that attacking US democratic institutions is appropriate and justifiable”, said a spokesperson for the Society for the Rule of Law. The group of conservative attorneys, academics, and former federal officials and judges also quoted sitting judges Royce Lamberth (“We cannot condone the normalization of the January 6 US Capitol riot”) and Carl Nichols, a Trump appointee who said “blanket pardons for all January 6 defendants or anything close would be beyond frustrating and disappointing”. In December, while sentencing a member of the Oath Keepers militia who pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy, the most serious charge brought in relation to January 6, the US district court judge Amit Mehta said: “The notion that Stewart Rhodes [the group’s leader, jailed for 18 years on the same charge] could be absolved is frightening and ought to be frightening to anyone who cares about democracy in this country.” In ongoing January 6 cases, the Department of Justice continues to argue that “general deterrence may be the most compelling reason to impose a sentence of incarceration”, as “future would-be rioters must be deterred”. Once, Trump would have agreed. On 7 January 2021, as the Capitol lay strewn with smashed glass and smeared with blood and feces, teargas lingering as troops stood guard, Trump faced historic disgrace. In a video address, he said supporters he told to “fight like hell” the day before had “defiled the seat of American democracy”, adding: “To those who engaged in the acts of violence and destruction, you do not represent our country. And to those who broke the law, you will pay.” Many have indeed paid. According to the Department of Justice, by 6 December 2024, 1,572 January 6 defendants had been federally charged. Of those, 996 pleaded guilty to felonies or misdemeanors and 215 were found guilty after contested trials. Just under 600 were charged with assaulting, resisting or impeding law enforcement; 174 were charged with entering a restricted area with a dangerous or deadly weapon; and 18 were charged with seditious conspiracy. Some rioters were convicted but did not serve jail time; 645 were convicted and jailed. The most substantial jail sentences, for violent crimes or seditious conspiracy, range from 10 to 22 years. But Trump did not pay for inciting January 6, escaping conviction in his Senate impeachment trial, and has long since changed his tune. On the campaign trail, he made the supposedly unjust fate of the rioters a key part of his stump speech. It would be his “great honor”, he said in Washington last May, “to pardon the peaceful January 6 protesters, or as I often call them, the hostages … a group of people treated so harshly or unfairly”. Elsewhere, he called January 6 prisoners “patriots” and even characterized the day they smashed their way into Congress – some looking for lawmakers to capture or kill in a riot linked to nine deaths – as “a day of love”. At rallies, and at his Florida home as his return to power draws near, Trump has played a recording of January 6 prisoners singing the national anthem. Despite it all, some think Trump has signaled that not all such offenders should expect pardons or commutations. In December, he told NBC “there may be some exceptions”, perhaps if “somebody was radical, crazy”. Some think that means Trump may not pardon those convicted of more serious charges, from assaulting police officers to seditious conspiracy. But Trump is notoriously difficult to parse. In the same interview, the president-elect rambled about the supposed presence among rioters of “antifa” – leftwing activists widely blamed by rightwingers but absent from January 6 legal proceedings – and other conspiracy theories. Asked if he would consider pardoning those who pleaded guilty to assaulting police, he chose to dodge the question. “I’m going to look at everything,” Trump said. “We’re going to look at individual cases.” His host asked: “Everyone?” Trump said: “Yeah.” Also in December, Time magazine asked Trump if he had “decided yet whether you’re going to pardon all of the January 6 defendants”. Trump said: “Yes.” Did he mean all of them? “I’m going to do case-by-case,” Trump said, “and if they were non-violent, I think they’ve been greatly punished. And the answer is I will be doing that, yeah, I’m going to look if there’s some that really were out of control.” Did Trump mean he would not pardon those convicted of violent acts, notably the 591 rioters then convicted of violence towards police officers? “Well, we’re going to look at each individual case,” Trump said, “and we’re going to do it very quickly, and it’s going to start in the first hour that I get into office. And a vast majority of them should not be in jail … They’ve suffered gravely.” Under Biden, January 6 investigations continue. A spokesperson for the US Department of Justice said: “The investigation and prosecution of those responsible for the attack moves forward … especially those who assaulted law enforcement officers and engaged in disruptive or obstructive conduct that interfered with the peaceful transfer of power.” The FBI, the spokesperson added, “currently has nine videos of suspects wanted for violent assaults on law enforcement agents or officers”, and is seeking public help to locate them. The question is whether the FBI and justice department will drop such investigations once Trump returns to power. Kash Patel, nominated for FBI director, has openly vowed to prosecute Trump’s enemies – and voiced conspiracy theories about January 6. Trump’s nominee for attorney general, Pam Bondi, supported Trump’s lie about electoral fraud in 2020 but is not on record about January 6 convictions and sentences or the investigation itself. Trump claims he will not tell Bondi or Patel what to do. ••• Amid such uncertainty, the question of pardons remains to the fore. To many observers, concern over Trump’s use of pardons and commutations in relation to January 6 highlights serious problems with presidential power itself. Related: Ex-CIA director Leon Panetta ‘hopeful’ that Trump will be more Reagan than ‘America First’ on national security “I think this power of the pardon has become abused, not just by Trump but by Biden as well,” Leon Panetta told the Guardian. The former White House chief of staff, CIA director and secretary of defense was referring to the current president’s decision to pardon his son Hunter Biden on multiple criminal charges – a move some said cleared the field for Trump to act with similar impunity – but also to speculation that Biden might preemptively pardon opponents of Trump now in danger of persecution, members of the House January 6 committee prominent among them. Trump could conceivably use the pardon power appropriately in January 6 cases, Panetta said, if any individual could be shown to have been “falsely accused or had problems” with their prosecution. “That needs to be taken into consideration,” Panetta said, even though there is “no question” that on January 6, “the mob was intent on making sure that the constitution was not followed when it came to the election. And that’s as close to an insurrection as this country has ever gotten. “In other words, if Trump takes a selective approach, that’s one thing, but if it appears to be a more blanket approach that really forgives all those that were involved in January 6, I think that would really undermine respect for the constitution and respect, frankly, for law and order.”",40,[],2025-01-06 13:50:29,2025-01-06 21:30:45
https://www.yahoo.com/news/rudy-giuliani-resume-testimony-contempt-130000000.html,Rudy Giuliani to resume testimony at contempt-of-court hearing in defamation case,,US,NBC News,2 min read,Giuliani was grilled in court last week at a hearing to determine whether he should be held in contempt for defying court orders tied to a defamation judgment against him.,Zoë Richards,2025-01-06T13:00:00.000Z,"Donald Trump’s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani is set to answer more questions after facing a grilling last week at a contempt-of-court hearing stemming from his failure to surrender valuable items to satisfy a $146 million defamation judgment against him. Unlike at Friday’s hearing, Giuliani will be testifying remotely Monday and responding to questions posed by his attorney, instead of lawyers for the two former Georgia election workers he was found liable of defaming: Ruby Freeman and Wandrea “Shaye” Moss. At stake is whether Giuliani should be held in contempt for defying court orders to surrender valuable items, including a New York Yankees jersey autographed by Hall of Fame outfielder Joe DiMaggio. Freeman and Moss have asked U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman to find Giuliani in civil contempt for failing to hand over the jersey and other items intended to supplement their $146 million judgment against him. The pair was awarded the sum in their defamation lawsuit against Giuliani, who they said had spread falsities about Trump’s election loss in 2020 resulting in an onslaught of racist and violent threats against them. Their attorneys had urged the judge in a court filing to apply “appropriate sanctions” to prompt Giuliani’s compliance with court orders after he repeatedly ran afoul of deadlines to turn over assets and financial data. Giuliani said Friday that the DiMaggio jersey was “missing,” and denied an assertion made by his friend Monsignor Alan Placa that he had seen it framed in Giuliani’s property in Palm Peach, Florida, within the past two years. Giuliani also denied withholding other Yankees memorabilia, saying he wasn’t “hiding” a signed image of Reggie Jackson, another Hall of Famer, that the election workers’ attorney say was listed as an asset in a bankruptcy document. Attorneys for Freeman and Moss have argued that Giuliani has demonstrated “a consistent pattern of willful defiance of the Court’s Turnover Orders,” and cited his failure to surrender the proprietary lease and co-op shares to his estimated $6 million Manhattan apartment, cash in his bank account and the title document for a Mercedes-Benz convertible. Giuliani is also facing a second contempt proceeding in Washington, D.C., this week over whether he should face sanctions for continuing to defame Freeman and Moss on his livestreamed “America’s Mayor Live” show, in defiance of a court-ordered agreement.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/driving-pierce-county-cemetery-fear-130000718.html,"Driving to this Pierce County cemetery, some fear they’ll have their own brush with death",,US,Tacoma News Tribune,21 min read,"Some say the stress of accessing the cemetery, right off a busy highway, deters them from visiting loved ones’ graves.",Julia Park,2025-01-06T13:00:00.000Z,"Grief doesn’t wait for the right time. For some residents in the Gig Harbor area, sometimes it has to. Barbara Rogers, age 80, believes the best time to visit Haven of Rest, a funeral home, crematory and cemetery along state Route 16, is very early on Sunday morning, when she feels highway traffic is lightest. Without an on-ramp from the cemetery to westbound state Route 16, drivers only have seconds to hit the gas and get up to speed as they merge off of the cemetery’s short access road. Rogers’ voice trembles when she speaks of those she visits at the cemetery. Her daughter is buried there. Next to her, a grandson. And in the baby section of the cemetery, she has an infant grandson. Her daughter died in 2018, and 2024 was the first year Rogers missed a visit on her daughter’s birthday because of anxiety about the traffic, she said. To visit Haven of Rest on a late Friday morning to speak with The News Tribune, Rogers accepted a ride from her friend, Maggie Garber, whom she described as “intrepid.” Garber is a business owner in Gig Harbor whose husband is also buried at Haven of Rest. “When we feel like we can’t go because of the traffic, that seems silly, but it’s truly an agonizing decision,” Rogers said with tears in her eyes. Garber said she also has to be selective about when she comes to the cemetery. She and Rogers agreed that having to think about the timing of one’s visits is an added burden to people who are grieving. “Sometimes people’s grief dictates when they need to come,” Rogers said. A kind of stillness hangs around Haven of Rest. In the middle of grassy fields, a fountain burbles gently in a pool. A smooth concrete path winds around the cemetery and takes visitors down a slight hill. Tall, sweeping trees shade benches where people can sit with memories of their loved ones and look out over the blue waters of Gig Harbor in the distance. It’s a stark contrast to the trucks, cars and motorcycles roaring past the entrance. Russ Weeks co-owns the funeral home, crematory and cemetery at 8503 State Route 16 NW with his brother, Doug. Weeks said they’re not the original founders of Haven of Rest, but took it over in 2013. It’s part of their family-owned business, Weeks’ Funeral Homes. The funeral home website says they also have locations in Tacoma, Buckley and other cities in western Washington, and that the first burial at Haven of Rest was in 1954. Weeks said that the number one concern from client families is the access road to the cemetery. Staff often get asked if there’s another way out, but there isn’t, he said. Some families have also chosen to go elsewhere for funeral services because they don’t feel safe entering and exiting Haven of Rest along the highway, according to Weeks. The access also affects cemetery employees. Kyle Proctor, funeral director and embalmer at Haven of Rest, has worked there for three decades, according to the funeral website. He recalls teaching his daughter how to safely get onto state Route 16 when she worked at the cemetery. He had her practice during rush hour when she was a teenager. The Haven of Rest property spans 29.5 acres and there are about 9,000 people buried there, according to Weeks. About 16 of those acres have been developed. As more space is needed, the cemetery will develop new sections of the property. Weeks wasn’t able to estimate how many visitors the cemetery gets every day, but shared a traffic impact study done in 2017 which estimated that on a typical weekday evening during peak hours (4-6 p.m.), a total of 15 vehicles either entered or left the cemetery per hour. Developing the entire 29.5 acres of the cemetery would add an additional 10 vehicles per hour to that total, the study estimated. Haven of Rest had the study done to get the city’s approval for expansion. Besides receiving visitors for their funeral services, the cemetery tends to see an influx of visitors on holidays, particularly Memorial Day, which Weeks said tends to be one of the busiest days for cemeteries. Gig Harbor-area resident Jackie Olivier, 75, goes to Haven of Rest frequently to visit her husband’s ashes. He died almost two years ago, the day after his 75th birthday, she told The News Tribune via phone. The two of them agreed that they both wanted to be cremated at Haven of Rest, Olivier said. She has since been struck by the beauty of the cemetery and how well taken care of it is. “It’s still a sad place, but I (tried) to get a place where his ashes would have some good views,” she said. While the traffic situation hasn’t stopped her from visiting, Olivier told The News Tribune via email that it’s terrifying to exit safely. Highway drivers seem to be aware of the cars trying to merge in, but she feels it’s “just a matter of time before something dreadful will occur,” she wrote. Renee Barnes, another resident who has lived in Gig Harbor since 1994, told The News Tribune via phone that her brother-in-law is buried at the cemetery. Her mother-in-law, who is around 70 years old, hasn’t visited his grave for the last three to four years because getting in and out of the area is so stressful for her. The spot has seen a few wrecks over the years, but it isn’t an obvious crash site. Proctor, the funeral director, remembers a fatal wreck on Aug. 14, 1989. That was the day an 86-year-old woman died in a crash near the entrance to Haven of Rest, he told The News Tribune. Her daughter worked as the secretary and receptionist at the funeral home. Reports of the crash in The Peninsula Gateway and The News Tribune said the woman was traveling westbound on state Route 16 in a rainstorm when she pulled her car off the right-hand shoulder into the path of oncoming traffic. She was thrown from her car when a pickup truck and another car crashed into it. She later died of internal injuries. The truck driver had minor injuries, and the third driver and his passenger weren’t hurt. Proctor said the woman was trying to turn into the cemetery, but misjudged where the entrance was and tried to back up, pulling into traffic when she did so. More recent crash data from the Washington State Department of Transportation indicates that few accidents near Haven of Rest have been serious in the last five years. Based on WSDOT data available on Aug. 13, there were 11 accidents documented between mileposts 13 and 13.1 on westbound state Route 16, which is the stretch of highway that includes the entrance to Haven of Rest, from Aug. 1, 2019 to Aug. 1, 2024. Of those 11, seven resulted in no injuries. None of the 11 accidents were marked as being related to a nearby intersection or driveway. A small business park has a similar entrance and exit off the highway less than half a mile from Haven of Rest. The stretch of highway surrounding that business area, from milepost 13.2 to 13.3, saw no officer-reported crashes from Aug. 1, 2019 to Aug. 1, 2024, according to the WSDOT data. That business area is where Mick Churchman, manager at Highway 16 Mini Storage, goes to work at 8809 State Route 16. He’s gotten used to getting on and off of the highway, but he worries about his customers. Many store their studded tires, skis or other winter gear in the storage units at the business, and come to Highway 16 Mini Storage to retrieve them after the first good snow, he told The News Tribune via email. The road to the business area — a private road, not a city road, according to Gig Harbor Public Works Director Jeff Langhelm — can get icy. “During the snow storm a couple years ago, there were dangerous driving conditions with snow and ice getting on and off the freeway here,” Churchman wrote. “It is very difficult for me to reach out to our hundreds of customers and warn them about driving conditions . . . This was a nightmare for me.” He worries about the weather forecast for January. The freeway access also seems to impact his business. Churchman wrote that some customers have called to ask about rates but lost interest once they learned where the business is located and how to get there. The business also used to rent out moving trucks via a partnership with Budget Truck Rental, and “customers were very intimidated by the idea of getting behind the wheel of a large truck for the first time and then needing to immediately get onto the freeway,” he wrote. Local street access to the business area could eliminate the need to enter the business area from the freeway. He’s heard people pitch this solution before, though he hasn’t been directly involved in discussions with any elected representatives or decision makers. He wrote that it: “does seem like there is interest in people building a back road out to town from around here. It’s just that no one wants to pay for it.” An agreement with property owners from 1958 allegedly holds the Washington State Department of Transportation responsible to build a frontage road that would eliminate the need to exit directly off the highway. In 2011-2013, a property investment group sued WSDOT in Pierce County Superior Court for their failure to fulfill that obligation, though the lawsuit was later dropped. WSDOT signed an agreement with private property owners Carl and Ruth Bartlett on Jan. 22, 1958 to take about 1.8 acres from them for the improvement of what is now state Route 16, according to a deed included in court documents. In exchange, the lawsuit alleged WSDOT promised to build a frontage road on the northeastern side of the highway to provide access to the rest of the Bartlett property. The deed did not list a date that WSDOT was required to build the frontage road. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit were members of Gig Harbor Property Investment, LLC, a group interested in building homes on land north of Haven of Rest. The home development was going to be called “Harbor Winds,” documents from the city’s public permit portal indicate. Because a new frontage road would provide access to the proposed housing development, the investment group requested in 2007 that WSDOT build the road in keeping with the 1958 agreement. WSDOT obtained funding for the 2010-2011 biennium and started working on a design for the frontage road, spending over $400,000 on site analysis and investigation, according to a motion Gig Harbor Property Investment filed in the court case. The department then told the investment group it didn’t have any current plans to build the road nor a future date for construction, Gig Harbor Property Investment alleged in the motion. WSDOT argued in its own motion to dismiss the lawsuit that it wasn’t obligated to build the road until the owners were cut off from accessing the property. “The deed merely serves to mitigate damages to the Bartlett remainder property should direct access onto SR 16 be eliminated in the future; access would then be perpetuated by a frontage road with access to SR 16 . . . Plaintiff does not allege a denial of access to the highway and, therefore, has failed to allege any breach of the deed,” WSDOT’s motion said. The lawsuit was then dropped. WSDOT spokesperson Cara Mitchell told The News Tribune via email Dec. 19 that WSDOT maintains the stance they took during the lawsuit. She also wrote that “WSDOT does not have plans or a design that would identify where a frontage road would start and end.” The total cost to build the frontage road in 2008 was pegged at $4.5 million to $5 million, according to Gig Harbor Property Investment’s legal complaint. WSDOT does not have an updated cost estimate, according to Mitchell. The News Tribune spoke to Gig Harbor Property Investment managing partner Alan Axelrod to learn more about the lawsuit and why it didn’t proceed. Axelrod told The News Tribune that the group’s lawyers believed pursuing the lawsuit further would be expensive and have an uncertain outcome, given WSDOT’s arguments, so the group voluntarily withdrew their complaint. The group began looking into paying for the frontage road privately because it was essential to their proposed housing development, he said. He said he can’t remember the exact figure for the cost to build the road, but the group ultimately decided it was above their pay grade. They weren’t willing to pay more than about $2 million, he guessed. After withdrawing the lawsuit, Gig Harbor Property Investment forged ahead with their plan to build Harbor Winds: a neighborhood of 124 single-family homes north of Haven of Rest. The 39.4-acre plat would also include three lots zoned for duplexes and two lots zoned for commercial/industrial development, according to the hearing examiner’s report and decision on the proposal in 2012. The company considered letting go of the frontage road idea and making 93rd Street, an existing private road that connects to Burnham Drive, the main entrance to the Harbor Winds neighborhood. They abandoned that idea in part because of issues obtaining the rights to connect to that street and others to the north, and concluded that a frontage road was the only feasible way to provide access to the property, according to Axelrod and findings from the Gig Harbor Hearing Examiner. Axelrod told The News Tribune a full design for the frontage road was completed, paid for by the company and the $400,000-plus that WSDOT put toward the design. The proposed road would be called 51st Avenue Northwest and run along westbound state Route 16 in WSDOT’s right-of-way. Its endpoints would be Rosedale Street Northwest and the business area north of Haven of Rest. Residents could enter the neighborhood through the business area, according to city documents. “The intent of this frontage road improvement design would be to eliminate access points along SR 16, primarily at the cemetery location and the (business area) location, where this frontage road would terminate,” a 2010 project proposal read, which Axelrod shared with The News Tribune. Problems quickly became apparent. The hillside where the development would go is very steep, according to Public Works Director Langhelm. It also has no existing city water or sewer access. Getting city water to the site would involve boring underneath the highway from the other side, he said. The site also contains seven wetlands and a stream in a deep ravine, according to the hearing examiner’s report. These features required additional planning for the development to proceed. The project review dragged on for about a decade from 2009 to 2019, the city’s public permit records indicate. Axelrod said there was a point when it all fell apart. He met informally with Gig Harbor Council member Jeni Woock to discuss the proposal in early 2019, Axelrod recalled. To his surprise, she discouraged him from bringing the plan to the City Council. One of her objections: the frontage road would add to the traffic going to and from Gig Harbor High School on Rosedale Street. “I was told to redesign the plat that we had been working on for the prior eight years and which had full city departmental approvals and try again,” Axelrod wrote in an email. That’s what the group did, for a time. They revisited the idea of making the neighborhood accessible through the private roads north of the property, but Axelrod said they never found a way to make that work. Asked if she recalls this meeting, Woock told The News Tribune via email Nov. 13 that she doesn’t remember the particulars of a conversation with Axelrod. She guesses she suggested he build the development according to the city’s code, because council members cannot stop developments when they are according to code, she wrote. Axelrod eventually believed the housing project would never succeed, which meant no frontage road. If a frontage road was approved to keep going all the way to 93rd Street and connect to Burnham Drive, it could have helped divert some of the downtown traffic and alleviate congestion, Axelrod said. “They missed a huge opportunity here,” Axelrod said. The investment group has been in talks with Haven of Rest to sell them part of their property for the cemetery’s expansion. Other than that, he’s not sure what the future of the land will be. Weeks confirmed that Haven of Rest is in the process of purchasing that land. The city of Gig Harbor approved a conditional permit allowing the property to be used as a cemetery, he told The News Tribune via email Dec. 17. Axelrod still has various documents and records from the planned development, sitting in storage, and let a News Tribune reporter see some of them during an interview Oct. 4. Asked why Gig Harbor Property Investment took an interest in the property in the first place, he said the answer is simple. “It’s beautiful,” he said. Former state Rep. Jesse Young, who represented the 26th Legislative District, including Gig Harbor, was among those who pushed for a frontage road near Haven of Rest. Young told The News Tribune in an interview Sept. 4 that he received calls from multiple constituents concerned about the traffic situation around the cemetery. Similar to Axelrod, he believed that a frontage road connecting Burnham Drive to Rosedale Street could help alleviate some of the city’s downtown traffic congestion. His goal was to gather stakeholders in the project — including Haven of Rest staff, local business owners and property owners and other elected officials — and push the project through. He said he was willing to work with WSDOT representatives to fulfill their alleged obligation to build the frontage road. The three solutions he came up with included: Add a lane to state Route 16, allowing drivers to both slow down while entering the cemetery, and get up to speed when leaving the cemetery to merge with highway traffic. Build a frontage road starting at Rosedale Street and ending at or near Haven of Rest. Build a frontage road that both provides entry to Haven of Rest and continues north up to Burnham Drive, thus serving as a “downtown bypass” to alleviate traffic in Gig Harbor’s downtown area. The News Tribune reached out to WSDOT and the city of Gig Harbor to ask about the feasibility of these solutions. WSDOT spokesperson Mitchell told The News Tribune via email Aug. 6 that the department “responded to a legislative inquiry about the possibility of a westbound right turn lane onto the Haven of Rest property or an acceleration lane out of the property” in 2021. This project “would require an investment that does not prioritize for funding,” she wrote. Former Gig Harbor Mayor Tracie Markley and City Administrator Katrina Knutson told The News Tribune in separate emails that it’s an issue for the state to address. “The city has no jurisdiction over” state Route 16, Markley wrote in an email Aug. 7. “As much as we desire a solution there does not appear to be funding or political will in Olympia to get this accomplished at this time.” “The city does not have any current or future plans to construct a frontage road from Rosedale to Haven of Rest,” Knutson wrote Nov. 18. “As we understand, this is a state issue and one for WSDOT to analyze and see where it fits within their priorities.” Langhelm, the city public works director, said that it’s possible the frontage road could help divert some of the downtown traffic. In order to provide a definite answer, he said he would need to look at past traffic models, which evaluate how cars move through the city’s road network. The frontage road, if built, would eventually become the responsibility of the city. Young said he was hoping other elected representatives included in those early meetings with stakeholders would pick up the project after he lost his bid for a state Senate seat in 2022, but isn’t aware of any progress. He recently ran for his previous state House seat in November and lost to Adison Richards. Asked if residents have mentioned issues accessing the Haven of Rest cemetery, incoming state Rep. Adison Richards told The News Tribune that he’s heard more traffic concerns about the Wollochet Drive interchange with state Route 16. The cemetery issue didn’t come up often on the campaign trail, but he’s “all about trying to identify new things to work on,” he said via phone Dec. 18. The state’s transportation budget deficit is a challenge he’ll have to face. The Urbanist reported that lower-than-expected revenue from the state’s gas tax — which Richards said is partly because of the increase in electric vehicle use — and Climate Commitment Act, combined with soaring costs for highway expansion projects, are among the reasons for the deficit. Washington’s 26th Legislative District was largely left out of the 2015 Connecting Washington transportation package, which Richards said he believes set the district “back at least a decade” in terms of the transportation projects they need funded. “I just joined the transportation committee and will have discussions with Chair (Jake) Fey and the committee to seek a creative solution here despite the budget constraints,” he wrote in an email to The News Tribune. The state granted Gig Harbor $1.7 million in 2023 to add two turn lanes at the Wollochet Drive interchange with state Route 16, The News Tribune reported. The city’s capital improvement projects website indicates both projects are still in the design and approval phase. Improvements to the Wollochet interchange were among the recommendations included in a WSDOT study of congestion on state Route 16 between the Tacoma Narrows Bridge and state Route 3. That study, completed in 2018, was prompted by “high levels of vehicle traffic congestion at peak travel times throughout the corridor that create spillover traffic on local streets,” the report said. The congestion is expected to increase as the population in the region grows. The report’s list of recommendations didn’t include improving highway access to the cemetery or business park. It’s been about two and a half years since Barbara Rogers, who told The News Tribune about her concerns driving to the cemetery, began trying to get something done. She started by reaching out to Russ Weeks, the cemetery owner. Then she shared her concerns with former Gig Harbor Mayor Tracie Markley and the City Council, state elected officials who represent the area in Olympia, and WSDOT representatives. Some responded to Rogers’ messages and promised to look into the issue. Others never responded, or contacted her and then didn’t follow up. She kept all her notes and printed out emails from each person she contacted and got responses from. Over time, she’s let the issue drop, she said. Rogers’ friend, Maggie Garber, said she thinks the state should put flashing yellow caution signs by state Route 16, in addition to the sign that exists, and place them farther down the highway to warn drivers that the cemetery entrance is coming up. That’s a measure she thinks could be taken immediately, she said. What Rogers has emphasized again and again is that those who visit Haven of Rest aren’t just your “average” visitor. Those who come to the cemetery, whether they’re coming to make arrangements, visit loved ones or attend a service, are all in an emotional state, she said. Though there haven’t been many accidents near the cemetery recently, Rogers said she believes “it’s just an accident waiting to happen,” especially as the population — and traffic — continues to grow in the Gig Harbor area. Even if it starts with flashing signs, she hopes to see actions taken to make getting on and off state Route 16 there safer. “Something immediate, not 10 years down the road,” Rogers said. “. . . something immediate, because it feels like something needs to be done, now.” News Tribune archives contributed to this report.",0,[],2025-01-06 13:50:29,2025-01-06 21:31:02

Now there’s a growing push to make the same change in Massachusetts.,"Nicole Gabe ,Bob Dumas",2025-01-06T12:58:56.000Z,"Just getting the key to a new apartment can cost five figures. That’s considering the costs of the first and last month’s rent, a security deposit, and potentially a broker’s fee. This year a new ordinance goes into effect in New York City which will change how brokers are paid. Now there’s a growing push to make the same change in Massachusetts. A locally produced video has gone viral and has been viewed tens of thousands of times. The first line is “If you’ve ever rented in Boston, Somerville, or Cambridge, you probably paid for a broker, even though you didn’t hire them.” The system of tenants paying for a broker they didn’t even hire is frustrating to renters we spoke with in Jamaica Plain. “The broker fees are a great joke,” said one renter on Centre Street. The producer of the video is Bonnie Jin, a union organizer based in Cambridge. It one clip she says, “Forcing the tenants to pay for the broker’s fee hired by landlords is not the norm for most of the country.” While Boston, Cambridge, and Somerville have changes proposed on the local level, there’s a push to reform the broker system statewide. “You should have full disclosure at the very outset that the landlord is trying to transfer the broker fee cost to the tenant,” said State Representative Tackey Chan. The Quincy Democrat has filed a bill in three previous sessions to strengthen consumer protections. He plans to refile it again this coming year. He says the high cost of rentals makes this issue more important than ever. “Having a hidden cost or undisclosed costs or an additional month’s rent that you could not have accounted for in your budget really impacts your life.” Doug Quattrochi, executive director of Mass Landlords, said “The traditional role of a broker is super important. It’s to connect a landlord and a broker.” He thinks the New York ordinance is fine if it limits a landlord from hiring a broker and then making a tenant pay for it. “I’m worried in Massachusetts that people are going to go completely to the wrong end of the spectrum and say the landlord has to pay for the renter’s broker.” He believes renters are already protected by an existing state law. “General law 186-15B is the law restricting landlords on what we can require a renter to pay. That’s a good law and it says you can’t require a renter to pay a broker’s fee. You can’t require an application fee or a credit check fee.” Still, as the cost of renting gets more costly, renters are looking for any relief, and protection, they can get. “It would go a long way for some people and just make housing more accessible. I would be in favor of that being introduced in Boston,” said a man in Jamaica Plain. Another added, “It would definitely be a good idea. Any small amount is helpful to someone who is looking to rent.” Quattrochi also says that brokers play an important role in making sure fair housing laws are followed.

It was four years ago today that a violent mob spurred on by then-President Donald Trump invaded the U.S. Capitol Building in a deadly effort to nullify the results of the 2020 presidential election. The insurrection was an act of criminality that sealed Trump’s place in the history books as an enemy of democracy and the Constitution. Amazingly, however, the combination of misinformation and short voter memories has allowed Trump to mount a political comeback and in two weeks he will return to the White House. And for those who care about truth and the rule of law, Trump’s return, his promised pardons of the insurrectionists and stated plans to take revenge on opponents mark new low points in America’s national story. The bottom line: Donald Trump won the 2024 election, but that doesn’t change history or the need for all Americans to remember his past actions and to be more vigilant than ever in resisting future assaults on constitutional government. https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/MondayCommentary_January6.mp3  NC Newsline is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

The advisory started at 10 p.m. Sunday and the system could bring up to 5 inches of snow in that 24-hour period, with the highest amounts occurring in the southern portion of Cambria, Blair and Huntingdon counties, according to AccuWeather. Many area schools have announced delays or flexible instruction days. “With this storm, the farther south you are the more snow you’re going to get,” AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Tom Kines said. He added that the “theme” of the upcoming days is cold air and some wind with temperatures feeling like they are in the single digits. AccuWeather’s report described the storm moving out of the West as a “massive winter storm” that will bring snow and wind to the mid-Atlantic area, and ice and rain to Southern states. The Johnstown region forecast includes a high of 25 degrees and low of 16 for Monday with 3 to 6 inches of snow possible. Kines cautioned that if people don’t need to be on the roads Monday, they should avoid travel as the storm pushes through, and for those that have to be out, they should make sure their vehicles are stocked with a warm blanket, small snow shovel, sand or salt, and other emergency gear. As for shoveling, he said residents should approach the task slowly, saying it’s “not a race,” and they should make sure to layer clothing with care taken for the ears, head, hands and feet. Tuesday could bring another inch of snow with a high of 24 degrees, a low of 16 and RealFeel of 7 degrees. Wednesday’s weather also features a frigid RealFeel temperature of 1 degree and possibly more snow. “One silver lining from the storm is it should be a dry, fluffy snow,” Kines said. The last single-digit RealFeel day is Thursday with the weathering having a high of 20 and low of 9 and RealFeel of 3 degrees. Temperatures will start to climb Friday to a high of 26 degrees with a chance of afternoon flurries, and the high for Saturday is expected to be 30 degrees with a low of 19. On Sunday, the high will be 28 degrees with a low of 18. The RealFeel for those days is still expected to be in the upper teens, but there isn’t anymore snow in the AccuWeather forecast until possibly Jan. 18. Due to the predicted weather, PennDOT has issued Tier 2 restrictions for interstates and the turnpike routes across the state, with the first set taking effect at 8 p.m. Sunday and the next beginning at 12:01 a.m. Monday. More information on that can be found at www.511pa.com/#:Alerts. Since the first winter storm moved into the region Wednesaday, Kines said there’s been a snow accumulation of 6 to 12 inches, depending on location. He said the average amount of precipitation is closer to 10 inches for most of the area, which is about what was predicted for the five-day span. Tips for bearing cold snaps such as these include layering up and limiting time outside if it’s necessary, according to Commonwealth of Pennsylvania information. The state’s winter storm page also notes the importance of using a trusted weather app to track local weather; signing up for Pennsylvania’s CodeRed alert system; and making sure homes are prepared for winter with proper caulking, insulation and weather stripping. To avoid frozen pipes, cabinets should be left open to allow warm air to circulate around plumbing fixtures, thermostats should be set at 55 degrees or warmer, at least, and faucets should let cold water drip. If it’s necessary to shovel, the state page advises residents to push snow instead of lifting to save energy, drink plenty of water, take frequent breaks and dress in loose-fitting layers. The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program says 64 degrees or higher is “usually a safe indoor temperature if everyone in the home is healthy” and “if there are any older adults, babies, children or anyone who has a chronic illness in the home, you will need to raise the temperature to 68 degrees to 70 degrees.” Additionally, LIHEAP suggests electric space heaters without a safety shutoff be avoided; to never use the stove, gas or charcoal grills, camp stoves or generators for heating inside a home, basement, near windows or a garage; and only use fireplaces or wood stoves if the units are vented outside properly and don’t leak gas from the flue or exhaust. Anyone struggling with heating their home should call the National Energy Assistance Referral Hotline at 866-674-6327 or visit www.energyhelp.us.

The Outdoor Power Equipment Institute also released tips for home and business owners for proper use when handling snow throwers. “Weather today is unpredictable,” OPEI President and CEO Kris Kiser said in a release. “You need to have your snow thrower serviced and ready to power up. Review your owner’s manual so you can use your equipment safely.” Tips offered by the institute include charging batteries; clearing the area of objects, such as children’s toys and mats; purchasing fuel; and reviewing the owner’s manual. When clearing snow, people should also aim with care; operate in visible conditions; and use caution on hills and slopes, according to OPEI.",0,[],2025-01-06 13:50:29,2025-01-06 21:36:42

In subsequent interviews and court filings, Jensen has admitted to being a ""true believer"" in the QAnon conspiracy theory, which peddled a belief that then-President Donald Trump was executing a secret plan to rid the government and elite society of child sex traffickers. A Washington, D.C. jury found Jensen guilty in September 2022 of seven charges ranging from civil disorder to obstruction. His convictions included five felonies and two misdemeanors. The most serious charge against Jensen was obstructing an official proceeding, which could have landed him a sentence of 20 years in prison. Sentence: Five years in prison, 36 months of supervised release and $2,000 restitution to the U.S. Capitol architect Status: Jensen was released to a halfway house in January 2024. Bureau of Prisons records show as of October 2024 that he is no longer in federal custody. Daryl Johnson of St. Ansgar was charged in June 2022, along with his son Daniel Johnson, of Austin, Minnnesota. Prosecutors say the two men were among the crowd to enter the Capitol, although they are not accused of violence or damaging property. Both later posted repeatedly about the riot on Facebook, with Daryl Johnson claiming that any damage from the riot had been caused by ""Antifa"" and that the crowd had been peaceful until police attacked with tear gas and other munitions. Both were charged with civil disorder, entering a restricted building, parading or demonstrating in a Capitol building and two disorderly conduct charges. Daryl Johnson was the first Iowan to plead guilty to charges releated to the Jan. 6 attack. He plead guilty to a felony civil disorder charge and was sentenced in June 2022. Sentence: 30 days in prison, $2,000 restutution to the U.S. Capitol architect and a $2,000 fine. Status: Released from custody More: Iowan jailed for Capitol riot role gets more jail time for illicit tanning salon videos Earl Jordan, who was charged in October 2024, was the first Iowan to be charged in relation to the riot in more than two years. Investigators say a combination of anonymous tips and cellphone data helped identify Jordan, of Dickens in northwest Iowa, and his brother, Christopher Jordan of Utah. The two are charged with assaulting or impeding officers, civil disorder, entering restricted grounds and disorderly conduct. According to the FBI, the Jordans were together on the west front of the Capitol during the riot, during which a group of officers from the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department tried to move through the crowd to reinforce a police line. Earl Jordan was caught on video elbowing one officer as he brushed past him, then ""lunged"" toward him and ""swiped his hand at (the officer's) face,"" the FBI said. Later, the brothers can be seen in a crowd fighting with officers who were trying to secure one of the Capitol's doors. As the officers pulled the door shut, Earl Jordan ""picked up a piece of metal fencing and threw it"" toward the doorway, according to the FBI. Status: Awaiting trial More: How did police ID Iowa man in Capitol riot? Tips, phone tracing and surveillance, FBI says Cear Rapids resident Leo Kelly has been in and out of federal custody since being arrested less than two weeks after the attacks. He initially faced two charges, but in December 2021, he was indicted on seven: obstructing an official proceeding, entering a restricted building, parading or demonstrating in a Capitol building, two disorderly conduct charges and two charges for entering certain parts of the Capitol. He was released on bond before his trial. Kelly was convicted of all charges at trial. In August 2023, he was sentenced to 30 months in prison. However his case was sent back to court on appeal after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that prosecutors were too broadly interpreting one of the statutes on which Kelly and other rioters were convicted. Before that could occur, however, the Bureau of Prisons released Kelly from custody. An official later explained to the judge that staff had misunderstood the court's order to mean Kelly's sentence was complete, and apologized for the error. A judge reventually resentenced him to time served. Sentence: Kelly was stentenced to 30 months, which was reduced to time served (about 11 months) after an appeal. He must also serve 12 months of supervised release and pay a $5,000 fine, $500 in restitution and other court costs. Status: Released from custody Surveillance video shows Kenneth Rader, of Sioux City, inside the Capitol for three minutes during the riot, wearing a blue Trump 2020 sweatshirt as he entered through a door in the building's Senate wing. After looking around, chatting with a few people inside the building and picking up some shards of glass and plaster as souvenirs, Rader left the building. A relative reported him to the FBI shortly after the riot, according to court records. Rader pleaded guilty to parading, demonstrating or picketing in a Capitol building. Sentence: 90-day jail sentence and 36 months of probation Status: Released from custody More: As first cases resolve, some of Iowa's Jan. 6 riot defendants begin to speak Deborah Sandoval, a mother from Ankeny, was arrested in February 2021 along with her son. On the day her trial was scheduled to start in December 2022, Sandoval instead pleaded guilty to a single charge of entering a restricted building. She had faced a dozen charges. Once in D.C., Sandoval traveled from the pro-Trump rally to the Capitol, entering through a door that had already been forced open. Another rioter captured video of her shouting ""get her a-- out here,"" referring to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She remained in the building for approximately 24 minutes. Sentence: 5 months in prison Status: Released from custody Salvador Sandoval of Ankeny and Deborah Sandoval's son, is currently serving the longest sentence handed down to an Iowan in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021 attack. He was accused of repeatedly brawling with police officers inside the Capitol. According to prosecutors, after entering the rotunda, he and another rioter ripped a riot shield out of a police officer's hands and Sandoval then continued to shove and push at other officers, at one point nearly knocking down an officer who was trying to protect fallen rioters from being trampled. Sandoval tried unsuccessfully to take another officer's shield, and eventually was forced out of the building after about 15 minutes inside, prosecutors said. A judge found him guilty of six felony charges, including civil disorder, obstructing an official proceeding and assaulting or resisting officers, as well as a number of misdemeanors. Sentence: 88 months Status: In federal prison in Minnesota until October 2028 More: How a raging mob took over the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 A federal judge called Kyle Young a ""one-man wrecking ball that day,"" while sentencing the Redfield resident for his actions on Jan. 6, 2021. Young was arrested in April 2021 and is one of several people  charged in the assault of D.C. Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone, who was dragged into the crowd, beaten and shocked with a stun gun while defending one of the entrances to the Capitol during the riot. He faced more than a dozen federal charges, but agreed in May 2022 to plead guilty to a single charge of assaulting, resisting or impeding an officer. Young admitted in his guilty plea that he grabbed Fanone's arm during the melee, preventing him from reaching his radio or sidearm as he was assaulted. Fanone had a heart attack after his assault and has since retired from the department. He took the stand to describe the consequences of his injuries. ""The assault on me by Mr. Young cost me my career,"" he said. ""It cost me my faith in law enforcement and many of the institutions I dedicated two decades of my life to serving."" Video shows Young pointing a strobe light at officers, hurling a heavy speaker toward them, and striking at them with a pole in what the judge described as ""15 to 20 minutes of active, enthusiastic participation in the violence inside."" Sentence: 86 months Status: In federal prison in Arkansas until June 2027. President-elect Donald Trump has expressed support for those who participated in preceding rallies and the attack on the Capitol. On the campaign trail, he referred to those who had been convicted as ""political prisoner(s)"" and vowed to sign pardons on his first day in office. In interviews since being elected, Trump has indicated there may be some exceptions.

See how the number and top speeds compare to 2023.","Victoria Reyna-Rodriguez, Des Moines Register",2025-01-06T12:32:17.000Z,"More than 1,000 drivers got caught speeding by the Iowa State Patrol in 2024. The Iowa Governor's Traffic Safety Bureau reminds Iowans: If you drive faster, you die faster. Here are the top speeding tickets Iowa State Patrol issued in 2024, excuses drivers gave officers and how it compares to previous years. Top speeds were higher in 2024 than the year previous. The top speeds recorded by Iowa State Patrol in 2024 were: 164 miles per hour: January 154 miles per hour: July 150 miles per hour: April 150 miles per hour: October 150 miles per hour: November The top speeds recorded by Iowa State Patrol in 2023 were: 150 miles per hour: May 2023 150 miles per hour: July 2023 140 miles per hour: August 2023 140 miles per hour: September 2023 133 miles per hour: December 2023 Sgt. Alex Dinkla, spokesperson for the Iowa State Patrol, previously told the Register that drivers give plenty of excuses when they're pulled over for excessive speeding. On Christmas Eve 2024, a driver was caught going 106 miles per hour in a 65 zone in Black Hawk County. The driver told a trooper that their heater wasn't working and they didn't want their windows to fog up. Iowa State Patrol even has eyes in the sky, as trooper pilots have been known to catch speeders around the state. In May 2024, a driver was caught near Ankeny on Interstate 35 going 116 miles per hour. Their excuse was they were running late to a graduation party. The driver received tickets for speeding and reckless driving. In 2024, Iowa State Patrol alone caught 1,062 drivers speeding. The five months with the highest amount of speeders caught by Iowa State Patrol in 2024 were: July: 139 August: 105 February: 103 May: 101 March: 100 However, Iowa State Patrol wrote fewer speeding tickets in 2024 than in previous years. In 2023, the department's troopers wrote 1,199 speeding tickets and 1,112 tickets in 2022. The COVID pandemic caused a sharp spike in 2020, with 1,497 speeding tickets given by Iowa State Patrol. Compared to only 659 speeding tickets handed out in 2019. Speeding is usually a misdemeanor in Iowa. For most speeding violations, the fines are: $20 for exceeding the speed limit by not more than 5 mph $40 for exceeding the speed limit by more than 5 but not more than 10 mph $80 for exceeding the speed limit by more than 10 but not more than 15 mph $90 for exceeding the speed limit by more than 15 but not more than 20 mph $100 plus $5 for each 1 per hour in excess of 20 mph over the limit Usually, there's a $100 fine for speeding violations in school zones. However, a driver who's caught going more than 10 mph could face stiffer penalties. In addition to a speeding ticket, drivers can get arrested on-the-spot for excessive speeding. But there is no definitive speed at which this happens; it's at an officer's discretion, Dinkla previously told the Register. Drivers convicted of going more than 10 mph over in a school zone or reckless driving can face up to 30 days in jail and $25 to $625 in fines. If a speeding violation results in the death of another person, it's possible to be convicted of homicide by vehicle, which is a felony. Convicted drivers are looking at up to 10 years in prison and $1,000 to $10,000 in fines. Victoria Reyna-Rodriguez is a general assignment reporter for the Register.

Kathy Hochul signed a first-of-its-kind bill regulating short-term rentals and requiring them to collect sales tax Dec. 24, according to a New York state Senate press release and an approval memorandum from the governor’s office. Her approval was contingent on a number of changes to the bill (S.885C / A.4130C), which will be enacted as a chapter amendment when the legislature is back in session. The bill was cosponsored by State Sen. Michelle Hinchey and State Assemblymember and Senator-elect Patricia Fahy, both Democrats. The previous form of the bill passed the senate in June 2023 and died in the assembly in early 2024, but finally passed both houses in June. It was delivered to Hochul on Dec. 12. In a Dec. 23 statement from Hinchey’s office, the sponsoring lawmakers and representatives from the state Association of Counties, the Association of Towns and the state Conference of Mayors touted the bill as an important step. “Our Short-Term Rental Registry is a breakthrough for New York’s housing future and a first-in-the-nation effort to hold billion-dollar booking platforms accountable in the communities they operate in,” Hinchey said in the statement. “Getting this done took serious teamwork with leaders from every level of local government, the tourism and hospitality industry and housing advocates who worked with us to make sure this bill would strike the right balance between supporting a local economic driver and working toward a future where housing is more accessible and affordable in New York.” Hochul’s requests In her approval memorandum, Hochul requested a number of changes to the bill that have been agreed upon by the legislature. The bill, as submitted to the governor, would have required STR hosts and booking services to register with the Department of State, including STR units already registered with local governments. The bill also called for the collection of sales tax from all units, imposing regulatory requirements and reporting requirements for hosts and booking services. The enforcement and data sharing obligations would have fallen on the DOS. The changes requested by Hochul, which will be incorporated in the form of a chapter amendment, largely deal with the registration system. “This bill would have imposed significant unbudgeted costs on DOS and would have created a tax regime that differed from what I had previously proposed in my Executive Budget,” Hochul wrote the memorandum, listing her main concerns with the bill. The largest change requested by Hochul was to create an “opt-out county-level registration system” instead of a statewide registration. The state, however, will still keep a database of data collected from quarterly reports from booking platforms. Other changes would be needed, Hochul wrote, to “avoid creating undue burden or unintended consequences for counties, localities, short-term rental hosts and booking services.” Hochul also requested that the legislature “clarify rights and responsibilities for localities with existing registries, localities that ban short-term rentals or localities within counties that do not establish registries pursuant to this legislation.” Airbnb Director of Policy Nathan Rotman expressed concern about the sharing of data and the burden placed on property owners and counties in a statement. “Airbnb works closely with communities throughout New York, including through 37 county tax agreements that have raised millions of dollars in revenue throughout the state,” Rotman said. “This unnecessary bill imposes a new, unfunded mandate on counties and creates a complicated bureaucratic system that burdens homeowners trying to earn modest income to pay their bills. It also puts the personal information of hosts throughout the state at risk due to data sharing requirements.” County response Shaun Gillilland, chairman of the Essex County Board of Supervisors, said the legislation is a welcome step for the county. Essex County already has an STR registry that towns and villages can access upon request, but the information collected from the state from booking platforms will be a supplement to that information, Gillilland said. This is particularly true for towns enforcing their own policies and dealing with complaints. However, the biggest boon for the county will be the sales tax collected by booking services for STR rentals. “From the county’s perspective, that was our number one concern that we advocated for,” Gillilland said. “The number of STRs we have in the county, that’ll be a big chunk of revenue that hopefully we can take off the property tax.” Franklin County Treasurer Fran Perry said their attorneys were in the process of reviewing the bill and determining what it might mean for the county, as of Tuesday. However, she agreed that the information and funding made available by the bill would be an asset for the county. As a rough estimate of the financial benefit, Perry said the county collects around $1,000,000 each year from the 5% occupancy tax on STRs. Since the county would receive half of the 8% sales tax collected by the state, the sales tax on those same STRs could likely boost the county’s revenue by approximately $800,000, although there is no way to predict the exact numbers at this point. Like Essex County, Franklin County likewise has a registry of STRs based on numbered certificates associated with the occupancy tax. However, the additional information provided by the state would be useful, Perry said, since the county does not currently receive information from hosting platforms like Airbnb about the registered STRs in the county.",0,[],2025-01-06 13:50:29,2025-01-06 21:37:12

The winter storm is spreading snow and ice from the Ohio Valley to the mid-Atlantic this morning, as seen in the radar snapshot below. Baltimore and Washington, D.C. both reported moderate to heavy snow with visibility of a half mile or less at times earlier this morning. Since then, the snow has lightened up and portions of the D.C. metro have seen sleet mix in at times. Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport had officially tallied up 4.7 inches as of 7 a.m. EST. However, some locations in the region from Washington, D.C. to Baltimore have seen 5 to 6 inches of snowfall. Yesterday, Kansas City picked up 11 inches, making it the heaviest snowstorm there since February 1993. Topeka, Kansas, saw its fourth-largest two-day snowfall with a total of 14.1 inches. The top storm total is 18 inches at thee locations in northeast Kansas. See our live updates page at this link for full updates on the storm's impacts. Winter storm warnings for snow and/or ice stretch from the mid-Mississippi and Ohio valleys to the mid-Atlantic. Those warnings include Baltimore, Cincinnati, Indianapolis, Louisville, Kentucky, and Washington, D.C. In all of these areas, travel should be avoided until the storm has passed. (MORE: Why Snowfall Forecast Sometimes Change) Baltimore, Charleston, West Virginia, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Washington, D.C. are some of the locations that will have wintry travel conditions that prompt delays or closures. Travel should be avoided much of Monday. Monday night, wintry weather should eventually taper off from west to east, but leftover snow and ice on the ground could affect travel in some areas Tuesday morning.

The forecast map below shows how much additional snow to expect from Blair on top of what has already fallen. Portions of the mid-Atlantic can expect 5 or more inches of snowfall. A few additional inches might pile up as far west as the Ohio Valley. Storm totals in the Baltimore and Washington, D.C. areas should wind up between 5 to 10 inches, with locally higher amounts up to a foot possible. The cyclone that became Winter Storm Blair arrived in the Pacific Northwest late in the day on Friday, January 3, where it brought fresh snow to the Cascades and Sierra before moving inland and southeastward through the Rockies the following day. Before the storm departed, it dropped more than 20 inches of fresh snow in the Wasatch Front in Utah. This was enough that avalanche crews triggered avalanches to protect people from further uncontrolled slides. The storm matured and strengthened as it reached the Plains on January 4th. Flurries and drizzled picked up late in the day across Kansas and Missouri. Freezing rain slowed travel in parts of Kansas and Missouri, including the Wichita and Kansas City metro areas where frozen roads caused crashes and slideoffs. The Kansas City airport was temporarily closed late Saturday and parts of Interstate 70 were closed Saturday afternoon. Thunder accompanied a mix of freezing rain, sleet and snow in central Kansas early Sunday, including Wichita. Snow, freezing rain, and sleet stretched eastward to the Ohio Valley on Sunday, January 5, snarling plans and coating everything in Louisville, Cincinnati and Indianapolis. The storm's messy precipitation led to interstate closures in Kentucky, including I-64 and I-75, and knocked out power to nearly 100,000 customers from Missouri to Kentucky. A portion of Interstate 70 was also closed in southern Illinois. Blizzard criteria was reached in Topeka, Salina, Dodge City, Russell, and Gardner, Kansas; and in St. Joseph, Missouri.

The new endorsements came from Marcia Fudge, of Ohio, who was secretary of housing and urban development in the Biden administration and chair of the Congressional Black Caucus when she was in Congress; Rep. Bennie Thompson, of Mississippi, the former chair of the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 riots at the Capitol; and Rep. Emmanuel Cleaver, of Missouri. All are backing O'Malley, as is Congressional Black Caucus Institute board member Lacy Johnson. In a statement provided first to NBC News, the Black leaders said, “Democrats are at a crossroads and we need a change agent now.” O’Malley called the news a “high honor” in a statement. O’Malley, a former governor of Maryland who ran for president in 2016 and most recently was head of the Social Security Administration, is centering his pitch to lead the national party committee on kitchen-table issues and his operational expertise. The endorsements come with less than a month to go in the campaign for DNC chair. Last week, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, of New York, threw his backing behind another DNC hopeful, Wisconsin Democratic Party chair Ben Wikler. Schumer is, so far, the highest-ranking Democrat to have made his preference known in the five-way contest. The field also includes Ken Martin, a DNC vice chair who leads the Minnesota state party; James Skoufis, a New York state senator; and several others without experience in elected office or leading a state party, like Marianne Williamson, the author and two-time long-shot presidential candidate. DNC members will elect the new chair Feb. 1 in Baltimore.

Freile, New York Connect Team",2025-01-06T12:26:00.000Z,"Brighton students continue to mourn the violent death of a classmate, as children, teachers and staff on Monday return to school after a two-week holiday break. A sixth-grader at Brighton's Twelve Corners Middle School was among three people who died in an apparent murder-suicide last week. The community has since rallied around the child's family, as they try to make sense of the unimaginable loss. According to Brighton police, officers were called to a home on Hollyvale Drive just before noon on Friday to assist an unresponsive girl on the porch. The child - 11-year-old Anne Mancuso - was taken to Strong Memorial Hospital, where she died from gunshot wounds. During their investigation, officers discovered open doors and a bullet hole in a window of a neighboring house. Inside, they found the bodies of Anne’s grandmother - Mary Liccini, 74, of Avon, Livingston County - and Anne's father -Lawrence Mancuso, 53, of Brighton. Brighton Police Chief David Catholdi said that the investigation determined that Lawrence Mancuso shot and killed his daughter and her grandmother before he killed himself. He did not live on Hollyvale Drive, where Anne resided, but elsewhere in Brighton, according to police. Eleven-year-old Anne ""Annie"" Mancuso was a sixth-grade student at Brighton's Twelve Corners Middle School, district officials confirmed Saturday. ""Annie was known to her friends and teachers as a kind, sweet, and beautiful person in every way,"" Brighton Central School District Superintendent Kevin McGowan said in a letter to the district's students, teachers, staff and families. ""A thoughtful, caring student and very special friend, Annie was such a gift to her friends, family and school community."" ""There are no words,"" McGowan said of the slayings. McGowan said that he, like others in the community, was ""horrified and deeply troubled"" by what unfolded Friday morning. ""I cannot begin to find a way to say to Annie’s mother Sarah and Sarah’s father how profoundly sorry we are,"" McGowan said. ""The peaceful tranquility of a winter morning was brutally broken (Friday) in one of our neighborhoods and the life of an incredible child and her grandmother were taken. The circumstances would be unimaginable if they weren’t a reality. They are the very definition of unexplainable, surreal, and tragic in every way."" Many Brighton neighbors on Sunday evening lit luminaries in memory of Anne Mancuso and her grandmother. Grief counselors for students and staff will be available in all BCSD school buildings on Monday and whenever they are needed. Students will be provided with direction on how to access those supports.

Snow is falling in southcentral Pennsylvania this morning as a winter storm is expected to deliver anywhere from a couple of inches up to nearly 6 inches near the state line. The National Weather Service is calling for around 3 inches in the York area and 5 inches or more near the state line, lead meteorologist John Banghoff said. It's similar for Adams County with the northern area expected to see about 4 inches and higher amounts close to the Maryland border. Lebanon County is anticipated to see less snow — about 2.5 inches — from the storm, he said. Schools are closed. Some districts will have a virtual learning day while others will have a traditional snow day. York County buildings are closed on Monday because of the storm, said Ted Czech, public information officer for the York County Office of Emergency Management/York County 911. Spring Garden Township has announced that its police and administrative offices also will be closed. Some garbage companies will not be collecting trash today. The City of York announced a one-day delay for refuse collection this week because of the snow. The state Department of Transportation is urging residents not to drive in the snowy conditions. It has reduced the speed limit to 45 mph on the following highways: Interstate 83 Interstate 81 from the Maryland state line to district line in Lebanon County (Schuylkill County line) Interstate 283 PA 581 Route 22/322 from I-81 to Millerstown Borough in Perry County US 15 from the Maryland state line to the district line in Perry County (Juniata County line) Light to moderate snow will continue to fall through noon today, Banghoff said. It will end around 2 p.m. for most areas, but some locations along the state line will continue to see some lingering snow showers through the afternoon. A second batch of snow will fall tonight in the southern counties and affect the evening commute, he said. The accumulation is expected to be about half an inch. Meteorologists say another potential storm could affect southcentral Pennsylvania this weekend, but it's still too early to tell what it might bring, Banghoff said. The time frame would be Friday into Saturday. Stay tuned.

Shōgun and Hacks also took top honors in their respective TV categories. The awards show featured several emotional acceptance speeches from winners including Demi Moore, Adrien Brody, Fernanda Torres and Sebastian Stan, some of whom turned the spotlight on themes highlighted in their films. Nikki Glaser hosted the event for the first time, at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles, where she took playful aim at many of the night's films and nominees. The comedian also donned several gowns, with one ensemble including accessories inspired by the Golden Globe-nominated films Wicked and Conclave. Here's what else you might have missed at the awards show. Host Nikki Glaser continued to turn heads throughout the awards ceremony with a series of stunning outfit changes. Glaser sparkled in a strapless gown with a vibrant metallic purple hue and black accents. The host went back to black in a sleek gown with a plunging neckline and a thigh-high slit. The host stepped into her second floor-length silver number of the night. The host then stepped out in a deep crimson gown with shimmering sequins and crystal embellishments. To close out the show, the host opted for an animal print design with structured shoulders and a deep V neckline. After Emilia Pérez took home the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture — Musical or Comedy, the film's star Karla Sofía Gascón delivered a powerful speech to close the night. Gascón, who made history as the first transgender woman to be nominated as a lead actress for a film at the Golden Globes, began with a heartfelt and uplifting message: ""The light always wins over darkness."" She went on to honor the resilience of the trans community, saying, ""You can maybe put us in jail, you can beat us up, but you never can take away our soul, our existence, our identity. I want to say to you: Raise your voice ... and say, 'I am who I am, not who you want.'"" Adrien Brody won the award for Best Performance by a Male Actor in a Motion Picture — Drama for his role in The Brutalist. The film, which is a sprawling 3 hours and 35 minutes long with an intermission, also won Best Motion Picture — Drama. Brody stars as an architect who flees postwar Europe for the United States. He told Yahoo Entertainment in December that the story hit close to home. “I definitely have an intimate understanding of the immigrant experience, as my mother is a Hungarian refugee,” Brody told Yahoo Entertainment. “My grandparents and my mother fled Budapest in 1956 and came to America with hopes and dreams.” In his acceptance speech, he also thanked his father. ""My goodness, you always hold me up. I often credit my mother for her influence on me as an artist, but Dad, you are the foundation of this family and all this love that I received flows back to you tonight,"" he said. Brody also gave a shout-out to his fellow nominees, saying that The Brutalist is, at its core, a ""story about human capacity for creation."" The Brazilian actress Fernanda Torres, who stars in I'm Still Here, dedicated her award for Best Female Actor in a Motion Picture — Drama to her mother, who once attended the Golden Globe Awards as a nominee. ""I want to dedicate [the award] to my mother,"" Torres said in her speech, referring to Fernanda Montenegro, who was nominated for her role in the 1998 film Central Station. ""You have no idea, she was here 25 years ago."" She added that this is ""proof that art can endure through life, even in difficult moments.""

Fans hope it's the end of doppelganger contests.,,Entertainment,Business Insider,3 min read,Timothée Chalamet and Glen Powell brought lookalike competition winners to the Golden Globes — and some hope the craze has now had its day.,Eammon Jacobs,2025-01-06T12:31:16.000Z,"Timothée Chalamet and Glen Powell brought lookalike competition winners to the Golden Globes. Lookalike competitions sprung up in 2024 for actors like Zendaya, Paul Mescal, and Jeremy Allen White. After Chalamet and Powell took theirs to the Golden Globes, some say the lookalike trend should stop. Timothée Chalamet and Glen Powell brought the winners of their lookalike competitions to the Golden Globes, and it's clear that the trend can be left in 2024. On January 5, the actors brought the winners of their respective lookalike competitions to the Golden Globes awards ceremony in Los Angeles. They were Miles Mitchell, who won wearing a ""Wonka"" costume, and Max Braunstein, who won dressed as Powell's ""Top Gun: Maverick"" character. The pair of impersonators walked the red carpet and met their respective actors during the event. Many fans were surprised at how much Braunstein looks like Powell, but some were more critical of Mitchell. The lookalike events gained momentum at first because plenty were amused by the the idea of dozens of people trying to convince fans they looked like their favorite A-lister. But the pair's Golden Globe appearance feels like the natural conclusion to the lookalike fad. Going to the Globes ceremony is quite a coup, and hard to top in the future — unless they suddenly find themselves at the Oscars, of course. (Don't do it, Hollywood!) Like any trend, the lookalike competitions got boring as other events around the world tried to do the same for other actors including Zendaya, Paul Mescal, and Jeremy Allen White. Some now think it's time to put these contests to bed. Powell and Chalamet's decision to embrace the lookalike contests has probably made them more accessible to their audience and could help their careers. The events originally started in October when hundreds of Chalamet fans and impersonators gathered in Washington Square Park in New York for the competition. The actor himself briefly attended the event to pose for photos with some of the lookalikes. Powell upped the stakes for his lookalike competition, held in November in his hometown of Austin. He offered the winner a chance for their family to have a cameo in his next movie, a cowboy hat, and a year's supply of tacos.

The Tesla CEO posed the question in an early Monday morning tweet, the latest in a multi-day social media bender aimed at the U.K. that has seen him advocate for a jailed right-wing activist, call for the head of a right-wing party leader, and demand that a junior minister of the new Labour government be thrown in prison. Musk has, in recent days, lambasted the British government over its handling of investigations into organized gangs that allegedly oversaw the systematic rape of young women. The Labour government rejected a request for a public inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Oldham in October, saying it is focused instead on enacting the recommendations of the final 2022 report of the Independent Inquiry into Child Sex Abuse, none of which were implemented by the previous Conservative government. Musk has also called for the jailing of Jess Phillips, the junior minister in Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s cabinet responsible for the violence against women file, calling her a “rape genocide apologist.” Those comments earned a stern rebuke from Starmer on Monday, who implied Musk is taking advantage of the “utterly sickening” issue of child exploitation to draw attention to himself. Asked about Musk’s remarks on Monday, the PM replied: “Those who are spreading lies and misinformation as far and as wide as possible are not interested in victims, they’re interested in themselves.” In his recent posts, Musk has repeatedly offered his support to Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, a Islamophobic fascist activist who uses the pseudonym Tommy Robinson. Robinson—who has been convicted of mortgage fraud and assault, was a member of the fascist British National Party, and is alleged to have stalked a female journalist at her home—is currently serving an 18 month prison sentence for repeating false allegations against a Syrian refugee. Musk has called for his release. Nigel Farage, the MAGA-loving leader of Britain’s right-wing Reform Party, has taken care to distance himself from Robinson. On Sunday, Musk called for Farage’s removal as Reform leader after he said he disagreed with the Tesla CEO’s support for Robinson. And not to be outdone, another right-wing Brit threw his hat in the ring on Sunday: Andrew Tate, the misogynist influencer facing rape and human trafficking investigations in Romania, asked in an “ultra serious post” whether he should run for prime minister to unseat Starmer. Musk’s poll on X asking whether America should liberate Britain had received 64 percent support from 500,000 votes as of the time of publication. The tech billionaire and ardent Trump supporter has also dipped into German politics in recent weeks, offering his endorsement to the far-right Alternative für Deutschland party over the holidays. On Monday, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre told public broadcaster NKR he finds it “worrying that a man with enormous access to social media and large financial resources is so directly involved in the internal affairs of other countries.”",1.6k,[],2025-01-06 13:51:51,2025-01-07 02:26:31

The tech would be in exchange for it sending troops to fight Ukraine, Antony Blinken said on Monday. The US and its allies have accused Russia and North Korea of trading arms and military technology. Russia could share satellite technology with North Korea in exchange for the troops it sent to fight Ukraine, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has warned. Blinken said the US had reason to believe that ""Moscow intends to share advanced space and satellite technology with Pyongyang,"" during a press conference in Seoul on Monday. North Korea ""is already receiving Russian military equipment and training,"" he added. If confirmed, it would add to Russia's reported ongoing efforts to help North Korea advance its satellite launch program. Kim Jong Un, the North Korean leader, has repeatedly tried and often failed to launch satellites into space. The country said it had successfully launched a military spy satellite in November 2023. The most recent failure was when a rocket exploded during the first stage of flight in May last year. At the time, the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported, citing an unnamed senior defense official, that a ""large number"" of Russian technicians had entered North Korea to guide the country's space program ahead of the failed launch. In September 2023, Russian President Vladimir Putin promised Russia would help North Korea build satellites. Having a satellite network would allow North Korea to identify targets to strike with its missiles and strengthen its ability to launch a preemptive strike against the US or its allies, giving them only a few minutes to respond. However, ""brazen acts of unprovoked military violence"" are not in North Korea's best interest, said Marco Langbroek, a satellite tracker and lecturer in optical space situational awareness at The Netherlands' Delft Technical University. ""If anything, North Korea improving its intelligence position through a better reconnaissance satellite program with Russian help could help ease some of the North Korean paranoia regarding US and Allied activities in the region and avoid things getting out of hand by mistake,"" he added. Russia and North Korea's relationship has come under scrutiny in the past year after both countries signed a strategic partnership agreement in June, which requires the countries to defend each other in the event of aggression. The US and its allies had previously accused Moscow of sending raw materials, food, and technical expertise to Pyongyang in exchange for shipments of artillery ammunition and missiles that Ukraine has reported seeing on the battlefield. North Korea has also sent thousands of troops to aid Russia in its fight against Ukraine, officials from South Korea, Ukraine, and the US have said. Blinken suggested Russia-North Korea's relations could go deeper as Putin may be ""close"" to formally accepting North Korea's status as a nuclear power. He also described North Korea's deployment of artillery, ammunition, and troops as one of the ""biggest ongoing drivers"" that enabled Russia's war against Ukraine.

The HB3 law requires users to provide ID to access adult sites. Noncompliant platforms face fines. After the law was enacted, interest in VPNs in Florida skyrocketed. Searches for VPNs in Florida skyrocketed after Pornhub exited the state over a new law requiring age verification for adult websites. VpnMentor told Forbes it ""detected a surge of 1,150% in VPN demand"" in Florida in the first few hours after the law took effect at the start of the year. The company described the surge as ""staggering."" Google searches for ""VPN"" in Florida also experienced a notable rise. While Google Trends doesn't give exact search figures, it showed that interest in the term ""VPN"" in Florida reached a score of 100 on New Year's Day. A value of 100 represents peak popularity for a term, a sharp increase from a score of 58 the day before. Interest remained high as of Monday, with the term scoring 82. VPNs allow users to hide their location and IP address by routing their internet connection through a remote VPN server, allowing them to bypass regional blocks on websites. The surge in VPN interest followed the implementation of HB3, which was passed by Florida lawmakers and signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis. HB3 requires users to verify their ages with a third party using a driver's license before they can view pornographic material. If platforms hosting explicit material fail to comply, they can be fined up to $50,000 for each violation. Oklahoma, Idaho, and North Carolina have also introduced similar age-verification laws. Last year, Pornhub exited Texas in protest over a legally contentious effort to introduce age-verification requirements. Proton, a VPN service, said on Friday that it had received a ""massive surge"" in sign-ups for its services in the US. ""Typically, we see such spikes from countries with unstable governments facing internet shutdowns, meaning this is an anomaly,"" it said. In a follow-up X post, Proton described it as a ""false alarm"" and said the surge was the result of ""porn."" Pornhub, the world's most visited adult website and one of the most visited websites in the world, has already blocked access to its content in 17 states, according to The Independent. In a statement provided to media outlets, Aylo, Pornhub's parent company, described the age-verification methods outlined in such laws as ""ineffective, haphazard, and dangerous."" ""Any regulations that require hundreds of thousands of adult sites to collect significant amounts of highly sensitive personal information is jeopardizing user safety,"" it continued. Those attempting to access Pornhub in Florida without a VPN are now shown a video presented by the adult-entertainment star Cherie DeVille, who says ""giving your ID card every time you want to visit an adult platform"" is ineffective and puts children and users' privacy at risk. Beyond grappling with age-verification laws, Aylo is also dealing with a wave of legal challenges. Hundreds of people have sued the company, alleging the website knowingly profited from videos depicting their abuse. In August, a Toronto law firm began a three-year independent monitorship of Pornhub and Aylo, which will review how Aylo responds to takedown requests and how it screens for illegal content.

Donald Trump’s election to the White House in 2016 was a symptom and not the cause of these deep problems. There is extreme income inequality and the gangster capitalist regime that profits from it, racism and white supremacy, a growing lack of faith in democracy and other governing institutions such as the news media and the elites more broadly, widespread social atomization and loneliness, collective exhaustion and lack of sleep, anti-intellectualism, mass death and trauma from the COVID pandemic, a broken educational system, a media culture of spectacle and distraction and an overall sense that “a return to normal” is not that great and “playing by the rules” and “working hard” to achieve the “American Dream” was a cruel joke and has been for a very long time. Too many political observers — especially the institutionalists and centrists — incorrectly convinced themselves that Trump’s first victory was an acute aberration, in what was fundamentally a sound democracy that had widespread support and legitimacy among the American people. These supposed experts willfully repeated that same error years later, because to admit they were catastrophically wrong would be a narcissistic injury both to them personally but also to the larger political class that has given them much of their identity and social capital. With Trump's 2024 victory over the Democrats, Trump and the MAGAfied Republicans take control of the presidency and both chambers of Congress. Trump and the MAGA movement also expanded their base of “populist” support in the form of a rainbow coalition of malice, rage and resentment, creating what could potentially be a realigning political force in American politics that will dominate for years if not decades to come. Donald Trump has promised to be a dictator on “day one” of his presidency. All the evidence points to Trump immediately following through on his autocratic vision and what he and his agents describe as a “shock and awe” campaign against “the enemies within” and the “poison” in the “blood” of the nation. Per Trump and his agents’ own words and meaning, this will likely be a very “bloody"" and ""traumatic"" story. It is true that President Biden achieved many great policy successes for the American people in terms of the economy, the social safety net, infrastructure and manufacturing, defeating the COVID pandemic, restoring the country’s respect and influence abroad and broadly trying to remedy the worst of the great damage caused by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans and the larger antidemocracy movement. But Biden and the Democrats were defeated in the 2024 election because they failed to effectively and consistently communicate those successes to the American people. In all, President Biden’s time in the White House will, in the mid to far future, likely be looked back upon as some interregnum and intervening years in the larger Trumpocene. In many ways, the Biden administration and what it embodied was like a beloved relative or favorite pet that is very ill and the family convinces themselves that because today (or the last few weeks of months) has seen improvement things will somehow miraculously be fine in the end. As the world saw on Election Day, that is not what usually happens in the real world. If American democracy and society were sick and ailing before, Trump’s return to power in a few weeks may be terminal. Even more tragically, this is the poison that the American people chose for themselves: Donald Trump won the Electoral College and the popular vote. On what appears to be America’s now semi-permanent democracy crisis and state of emergency, Steven Levitsky, who is the author of numerous books including “How Democracies Die” and “Tyranny of the Minority: Why American Democracy Reached the Breaking Point”, told MSNBC’s Chris Hayes during a recent interview that, “I’ve been trying to think of a happy ending and it’s getting harder and harder."" The problem is, as I mentioned earlier, relatively ending well has often emerged after a period of really bottoming out. You really see political elites sort of doing the right thing after really horrible experiences of authoritarianism, thinking about places like Chile and Uruguay, Spain and Portugal and South Korea too. I think, there will be an election in 2028. I’m not as pessimistic as some. I don’t think we’re sliding into fascism. I think there’s a very good chance that the Democratic Party wins the 2028 election, but it’s not clear how we rebuild a consensus in favor of basic small D democratic politics. Ultimately, Donald Trump and MAGA’s repeat ascendance to power reflects how American democracy and society in 2025 exist in a state of competitive authoritarianism and what is, in many ways, a shambling corpse. In an attempt to make better sense of our collective emotions (and tumult and upset) in these weeks before Trump’s return to power, reflect on the previous year and the election, and what may come next, I recently spoke to a range of experts. Rick Wilson is a co-founder of The Lincoln Project and a former leading Republican strategist. He is the author of two books, ""Everything Trump Touches Dies"" and ""Running Against the Devil: A Plot to Save America from Trump - and Democrats from Themselves."" Look, we’re obviously disappointed with the outcome of the election, but we always knew it would be close. This country remains very evenly split and Trump doesn’t have nearly the mandate that his minions are trying to portray. The House of Representatives is as close as it gets and has a weak Speaker who’s completely unable to manage the chaos caucus. It was a chaotic year with more moving parts than any election in modern history and we knew all along it was a toss-up. But while we lost an election, we weren’t wrong about the threat Trump poses and we aren’t wrong about the chaos that’s coming. Look at the end-of-the-year budget battle where Trump and Musk threw a wrench into the works at the last second without any regard for the consequences. As Inauguration Day grows closer, we are gearing up for another fight and plan to take it to Trump every single day. We will contest his insane cabinet picks and continue to tell the world when the emperor’s not wearing any pants. We refuse to bow down to an undemocratic administration. The future of the nation remains at stake. We already see Trump trying to silence the media and push corporations into not opposing his plans. Someone needs to step into the void and rally the opposition. As for what comes next, Trump meant what he said on the campaign trail and he’s following through. He’s looking to implement tariffs that will hammer the middle class, will try to deport millions of people by putting the military on American streets and will retreat from the world leaving dictators like Putin to run roughshod all over Europe. That’s the nightmare scenario. But one constant remains — Trump cannot help himself. He’s an agent of chaos who has to inject himself into every story, whether it’s helpful or not. He nearly derailed the budget to cause a shutdown and weakened Johnson even more. He empowered Musk and is now upset he’s stealing the spotlight and his influence. And as always, I remain hopeful that the American people will see the terrible consequences and push back to correct his oversteps. Jennifer Mercieca is a historian of American political rhetoric. She is a professor in the Department of Communication and Journalism at Texas A&M University and author of several books, including ""Demagogue for President: The Rhetorical Genius of Donald Trump."" It's hard for me to look back on 2024 without feeling nihilism — nothing mattered. The truth about Trump didn't matter. The threat that Trump poses to the nation and the world didn't matter. The legacy media didn't matter. The Harris campaign didn't matter. If none of those things matter, then what are we even doing talking about it — who is this for, who will read it and will they care? I've been thinking a lot of a line that Jean Baudrillard wrote in ""The Ecstasy of Communication"": ""Let us be Stoics: if the world is fatal, let us be more fatal than it. If it is indifferent, let us be more indifferent. We must conquer the world and seduce it through an indifference that is at least equal to the world's. To counter the acceleration of networks and circuits the world will seek slowness, inertia."" Let us be Stoics. If the nation is indifferent to the threats to democracy, let us be more indifferent. They'll miss democracy when it's gone. Trump's return is still surprising. It's understandable. It was predictable. But it's still surprising to me that power-mad anti-democratic forces succeeded in taking over the nation and electing the most dangerous person in America as president.

I'm looking at Trump assuming office in 2025 with dread, calling to mind what Daniel Webster said about Andrew Jackson taking office in 1829. ""His friends have no common principle — they are held together by no common tie. My opinion is that when he comes, he will bring a breeze with him. Which way it will blow, I cannot tell."" Though, unlike Jackson in 1829, we have a pretty good idea of what kind of ""breeze"" Trump will bring with him. My goal is to face 2025 realistically. I hope to focus on the things that I can do to help defend democracy in America — mostly by staying in my lane and explaining anti-democratic rhetorical tricks. And I refuse to be trolled. It is what it is. I believe Trump when he says he's going to be a dictator on day one. I do not believe Trump when he says that he'll only be a dictator on day one. No one assumes dictatorial power and then gives it up. Good luck to us all! David Pepper is a lawyer, writer, political activist and former elected official. His new book is ""Saving Democracy: A User's Manual for Every American."" I enter the New Year knowing that Trump and his allies’ promises pose many risks to our nation, the democracy we’ve known, our communities and the lives of countless Americans. So, clear-eyed about these risks, of course, I worry. At the same time, with weeks passed since the election, the word that best describes my current mood is “resolute."" Why? Because I know that people in this country have overcome worse than what we must overcome now — waging their battle for democracy from far more perilous ground than where most of us stand today. Still, they overcame it all. So can we. Another lesson from past periods of democratic backsliding is that how we react now shapes the extent of the damage done by the forces subverting democracy and the rule of law. There will be damage either way. But history tells us that the risk of anti-democratic moments like this is that they can set in for long periods of time — lifetimes, even. Or they can be overcome in far shorter periods of time. So, what we do in the coming days, weeks and months will likely determine if we spend the rest of our lives feeling the worry we feel now, or if we are able to overcome our challenges far sooner than that. I resolve to make it the latter. One reason the passage of time amid these dark moments is dangerous is because of how quickly the collective memory of Americans evolves and can fade entirely. This underscores an especially weighty responsibility on those of us of a certain age: to preserve and pass on our lived memories of how liberal (the classic definition of the word), representative democracy operates in its best days. We must not allow the current times to settle in as the new normal as memories of better times disappear. We must also stay resolute because Trump and his minions will act quickly. They will throw as much at the country at once as they can. Test boundaries and barriers. Offend our sensibilities. And this will happen on multiple fronts to keep us occupied and distracted, despondent and in chaos. And that means the coming months are key. How we respond NOW is key. Every win early win matters. Finally, there is the inevitability that although they won narrowly, the right will act as if they won with an overwhelming mandate. They are already framing the election that way and using that “big mandate” to justify everything so far. This means they will overreach. That overreach will include dangerous and disturbing actions. It will involve policies that harm the lives and well-being of everyday Americans. And, importantly, it will involve decisions that prove to be politically toxic at the moment, or over time. This overreach after a very close election presents a near-term opportunity. We must seize it. To use another phrase — they will break it; we must ensure they own it. And to do so, the timing works in our favor. Think of it this way — the next four years are the second Trump term. And the inevitable failures of his overreaching policies, incompetence and toxic and divisive politics will become clear amid the build-up to the midterm of Trump’s second term. And we all know what happens in the midterms of second terms, right? 2006….2014…Now….2026. It’s the midterm of Trump’s second term. His assurance that he knew nothing about Project 2025 will have proven to be a lie; those and other toxic policies will have hurt everyday Americans by the millions; his entire approach will have offended a wide swath of Americans; his extremism will motivate others who sat out this election, or didn’t believe the worst of our warnings. But that will only happen if we are on offense and engaging Americans everywhere to see it all and respond. So that’s where I am. Resolute. To keep going.",49,[],2025-01-06 13:51:51,2025-01-06 20:19:04

The Airbus A220's cabin was filled with smoke after encountering an engine problem. An autopsy said a flight attendant died due to hypoxic brain damage, Blick reported. A 23-year-old Swiss International Air Lines flight attendant died due to a ""severe lack of oxygen to the brain,"" according to an autopsy reported by Blick, Switzerland's largest newspaper. It comes after an incident on December 23, when Swiss Flight 1885 encountered engine problems, and the cabin was filled with smoke. The Airbus A220 was flying from Bucharest, Romania, to Zurich when it made an emergency landing in Graz, Austria. All 74 passengers and five crew members were evacuated, 17 of whom required medical attention, the airline said. A week later, Swiss announced that one of the flight's cabin crew members died in the hospital in Graz. ""We are devastated at our dear colleague's death,"" said CEO Jens Fehlinger. ""His loss has left us all in the deepest shock and grief. Our thoughts are with his family, whose pain we cannot imagine."" Blick reported that the public prosecutor's office in Graz has launched an investigation into the flight attendant's death. A spokesperson told the newspaper that a Friday autopsy found the provisional cause of death to be hypoxic brain damage and cerebral edema, meaning brain swelling. ""The brain was massively damaged by a severe lack of oxygen, and the young flight attendant died of it in the intensive care unit,"" the spokesperson told Blick. ""We are also looking into the role played by the respiratory mask that the flight attendant was wearing,"" he added. The Graz public prosecutor's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider. Swiss said the investigation's initial findings point to a problem in one of the plane's Pratt & Whitney engines.

The rental company said last year that it would sell 30,000 EVs amid a slowdown in demand. Hertz is offering used Teslas for as little as about $18,000. Hertz is continuing to reduce the number of EVs in its fleet by offering customers renting an electric car the opportunity to buy it at a bargain. Last year Hertz said it would sell 30,000 EVs, including cars from Tesla, Polestar, and Volvo, because of the cost of repairs and maintenance. The fire sale means Teslas are being listed at discounted prices on Hertz's website, and now the company is asking some renters if they'd like to buy their EV. One person on Reddit recently said they were offered a 2023 Tesla Model 3 — which sells new for about $35,000 after federal incentives — for $17,913. The post included a screenshot of an email describing the offer as an opportunity ""to think of this rental as a test drive!"" Other people said they'd been offered similar deals for Polestar and Chevy electric cars. A Hertz spokesperson told Business Insider the emails were part of an effort to give all customers the chance to buy an EV or combustion-engine car that the company would soon put up for sale. Rental companies usually sell their cars after they have been driven a certain number of miles. Hertz's decision to buy 100,000 Teslas in 2021 was hailed as a turning point for the EV industry, but the rental company's electric shift hasn't gone to plan. Its EV fleet, which also includes cars from General Motors and Polestar, has had higher-than-expected repair costs and low resale values as demand for EVs has slowed over the past year. Hertz's EV fire sale means buyers can pick up a used Tesla Model 3 for as little as $17,900 or a Model Y for $27,700.

Reaching out to family and other caregivers for support helped.,,Health,INSIDER,4 min read,"After my husband's cancer diagnosis, I was his caregiver. My routines were upended and self-care was difficult. I reached out to others for support.",Louisa Rogers,2025-01-06T11:09:01.000Z,"When my husband was diagnosed with cancer, I was shell-shocked. My routines were upended at the same time I became his caregiver. I reached out to family and other caregivers for support. People often remark on how healthy my husband is. At 82, Barry scampers up and down hills like a mountain goat and out-paddles many members of his kayak group. So it came as a shock in September when we discovered he had stage 2 lymphoma. Cancer? Unbelievable. I was amazed by Barry's reaction to his cancer diagnosis. He didn't ruminate endlessly over what he could have done to prevent it, as I might have. A science journalist, he has researched and written a great deal about cancer. ""Some cells mutate when they divide,"" he said to me. ""If they didn't, we wouldn't be here. It's part of evolution."" Not only did we cancel an international trip when we found out, but in spectacularly bad timing, the routines that anchored my life also came to an abrupt stop. Both my yoga teachers stopped teaching, my weekly walking partner left town for the season, and as a freelance writer, I had few assignments. In the Myers-Briggs personality assessment, I'm known as a ""J,"" a person who needs structure. The prospect of several empty, shapeless months was deeply discouraging for me. Because Barry's treatment plan involved no radiation and only one chemo infusion every three weeks, we joked that he was experiencing 'cancer lite.' But his energy level dipped precipitously, and sometimes, I felt as though I had chemo fatigue, too. Our home situation reminded me of the beginning of the pandemic, except everything stopped for us while the rest of the world carried on. The uncertainty was the worst part. After the oncologist and nurses repeated the mantra ""only three chemo treatments"" several times, we optimistically penciled in the date when we hoped to fly to Mexico, where we spend part of the year. Then one week, during an appointment, our oncologist offhandedly said, ""Could be five, maybe six treatments."" What? I fumbled for Barry's hand under the table. ""I thought you said three,"" I said, trying to sound neutral. He shrugged. ""We don't know for sure."" I was furious at him for messing with our plans. How dare he? Of course, I was ignoring the fact that despite all the advances in the field, cancer is still an unpredictable science. As Barry's caregiver, I felt a responsibility to be resilient, but didn't always feel that way. My sister helped. ""Call me anytime,"" she said. She sent Barry homemade oatmeal cookies with a note that said, ""The way I'm supporting you is by supporting Louisa."" Through the internet, I found an online support group for caregivers sponsored by the University of California San Francisco Medical Center. It was only once a month — not enough for me — but I appreciated hearing from other caregivers about their cancer situations. We shared stories about feeling overlooked and neglected at times. Listening to them, I felt grateful that Barry's case was relatively mild. We weren't living through grinding years of cancer, and he wasn't going to die (not yet, anyway!). I also reached out to other family members. My brother-in-law, who lives with depression, told me that accompanying my sister to chemo appointments during her breast cancer a few years earlier had given him a sense of purpose and direction. Unlike me, he wasn't perturbed at not having much of an independent life. Barry, on the other hand, thrived on his solo time at the infusion center, chatting with the other patients. He joked that it was like flying Business Class, with reclining seats and gracious nurses attending to his every whim. Although he enjoyed introducing me to his new-found friends, he didn't want me there all six hours, and I, too, enjoyed my ""day off."" It's now been four months since Barry's diagnosis, and I am indeed writing this from sunny Mexico. Barry's latest scan showed him free of cancer, and his energy is gradually returning. And I'm back into yoga. But I don't have the pillowy confidence I once had, and maybe that's a good thing. I used to brag about my health — how fit I was, how I'd live to 100 or more. Now, I'm more humble. I feel for people with cancer, and especially for their caregivers. I know cancer never happens in a vacuum. It's a family disease, where everyone is affected, and no one is spared. Read the original article on Business Insider",1,[],2025-01-06 13:51:51,2025-01-06 20:18:22

Scientists predicted this effect, but unfortunately, even they couldn't foresee just how quickly climate disasters would ramp up. People in the Pacific Islands are being hit incredibly hard, experiencing seven to eight times more effects from extreme weather than they did just 10 years ago, per an Oxfam Australia report posted to Phys.org. The study examined the impact of climate disasters such as tropical storms, comparing the most recent decade (2014-23) with the previous one (2004-13). It found that between those two time periods, financial costs from extreme weather have increased eightfold. The difference is particularly pronounced in the last two years, reaching a peak of AUD$7.3 billion (about $4.5 billion). Not only that, but the productivity lost because of extreme weather events also takes a toll. The study found that the average GDP loss of Pacific Island nations was 14.3% this decade, compared to 3.2% in the 10 years prior. The number of people being impacted also rose 700%, from 80,300 to 607,000. In one particularly extreme case, the nation of Vanuatu lost 80% of its gross domestic product — twice, in both 2015 and 2020. This kind of devastating blow is almost incomprehensible for larger nations such as the United States, which haven't been hit all at once by this type of disaster. All these figures add up to one fact: The world's rising temperature is having disastrous consequences. Right now, the island nations of the Pacific are among the most vulnerable, and the people there are already suffering from the changes in Earth's climate. In light of the disproportionate impact on the Pacific Islands, Oxfam called on Australia's Minister for Climate Change and Energy, Chris Bowen, to set aside more of the country's aid budget for these nations, Oxfam Australia reported. In 2022-23, Australia offered AUD$265.9 million ($165.6 million) in climate financing to the region, less than 4% of the costs. ""We recognize that the ambition from climate activists in the Pacific and around the world is for a climate finance goal that is in the trillions,"" said Eunice Wotene, Oxfam in the Pacific's executive director, per Oxfam. ""To the Australian government and many other western governments, this might seem too ambitious — but if this research shows anything, it is that the scale of climate damage is beyond what we have imagined and getting worse by the day.""

When Paul Terek hung up his track shoes after competing in the 2004 Olympics, he found a new career at California's Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant. In 2016, he and 1,300 coworkers learned the plant would close in 2024. But something unexpected happened: The plant stayed open, thanks to local support and federal clean energy programs. The U.S. wants more success stories like Diablo Canyon. The Department of Energy announced plans to add 35 gigawatts of nuclear capacity by 2035, ramping up to 15 gigawatts yearly by 2040. This matches last year's international pledge to triple nuclear power globally by 2050. This shift could bring good news for your wallet and your neighborhood. Nuclear plants create long-term local jobs, steady energy prices, and reliable power that works rain or shine. They're also America's biggest clean power source, stopping 470 million metric tons of pollution annually, the equivalent of taking 100 million cars off the road, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. The plan isn't starting from scratch. Many current nuclear sites could host up to 60 gigawatts of new reactors. Former coal plant locations could add even more capacity, putting skilled energy workers back to work in their communities. New smaller reactor designs need less upfront money to build, making them more practical for many areas. ""This is a success story that we might not have seen a few years back when nuclear power plants were closing due to the economics,"" notes the Office of Nuclear Energy. ""Now, plants like these are looking to extend operations, retired reactors are in the process of restarting, and new reactors are inching closer to deployment thanks to the historic investments and tax incentives provided by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act.""

There were over 1,800 preliminary reports of tornadoes, more than 30% above average for the year. A Memorial Day weekend storm outbreak with tornadoes killed at least 22 people. Over a five-day period during the week of Christmas, there were dozens of preliminary reports of tornadoes in the South — and about 30 confirmed tornadoes. This was a significant outbreak of twisters during the first month of the meteorological winter. December also saw San Francisco's first-ever tornado warning. On the morning of December 14, a strong thunderstorm swept into the northwest part of the city. A tornado was reported in Scotts Valley, about 67 miles to the south. ""Based on video, photos, firsthand accounts, and radar signatures a tornado occurred [roughly] 1:40 PM,"" the Bay Area National Weather Service (NWS) posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, later that day. ""Social media reports of cars overturned and tree damage in and across Scotts Valley. Also video evidence of a tornado,"" its report read. A survey crew from the Bay Area NWS office later determined the damage from the storm within San Francisco was consistent with straight-line winds, not tornadic winds. The crew's preliminary peak wind speed estimate from the storm as it moved across the Richmond District and Golden Gate Park areas was around 80 mph. The NWS storm survey crews also documented several large trees that were either uprooted or snapped at their base. The storm also damaged a roof on at least one structure and downed several power lines. A Climate Central study found that the threat of supercells, the primary type of thunderstorms that produce tornadoes, is increasing dramatically in parts of the U.S., including regions that don't typically see this type of dangerous storm. The study also concluded that conditions conducive to supercells and tornadoes are expanding their reach into what were once less active winter months. Instability in the atmosphere that leads to warm, rising air is one of the essential elements needed for the formation of thunderstorms. One of the measures of instability that meteorologists use is ""convective available potential energy,"" or CAPE, which is projected to increase on our overheating planet, as Climate Central detailed. More CAPE could mean more intense storms that produce even more storm-related damage. While there are uncertainties involved, cooling our planet could reduce the atmospheric volatility that could help fuel tornadoes. This will require a shift away from a reliance on dirty energy sources to power our planet and a move toward cleaner, renewable energy options. We can reduce the amount of heat-trapping gases in our atmosphere by installing solar panels, replacing an old HVAC system with a heat pump, and using an induction stove.

Taylor defended the country's efforts to address global heating despite criticism from several island nations calling for more aggressive action. The New York Times reported that at a climate hearing at the International Court of Justice in the Netherlands, Taylor acknowledged the severity of the climate emergency but argued that the Paris Agreement — a legally binding international treaty adopted by nearly 200 countries in 2015 — is adequate to limit rising global temperatures caused by heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere. However, at several hearings in early December, some environmental advocacy groups and small island nations said that the world's biggest carbon polluters — including the U.S., China, and Australia — aren't doing nearly enough to make a meaningful dent in pollution. ""These nations, some of the world's largest greenhouse gas emitters, have pointed to existing treaties and commitments that have regrettably failed to motivate substantial reductions in emissions,"" Ralph Regenvanu, special envoy for climate change and environment for Vanuatu, a South Pacific Island nation, told the Times. ""Let me be clear: These treaties are essential, but they cannot be a veil for inaction or a substitute for legal accountability."" A climate campaign launched by Vanuatuan students prompted the United Nations to request an advisory opinion on the legal obligations of wealthy, heavily polluting countries toward the world's most vulnerable nations. While those on the frontlines of the climate crisis demand accountability from the U.S. and other rich nations, efforts to slow environmental damage may be in jeopardy under a second Donald Trump presidency. As the Times explained, he withdrew from the Paris Agreement during his first term and has vowed to pull out again once he takes office in January, per Politico. The landmark hearings are critical because they will provide clarity on the responsibilities wealthy nations such as the U.S. have to protect the most at-risk countries from the impacts of the rising global temperature. According to the nonprofit PassBlue, Vanuatu is already experiencing ""existential threats"" from increasingly severe climate disasters such as floods, cyclones, and droughts. The Times explained that the small island nation has incurred high debts to cover the costs of repairing infrastructure, destroyed crops, and reduced fish stocks. The student-led climate alliance believes that voluntary commitments from major polluters aren't sufficient to address their struggle and that the best course of action is to sue the countries most responsible for our overheating planet. Though the International Court of Justice's opinion on the climate will be nonbinding, it will hold significant weight since it is widely considered the world's top court. Once judges issue their statement, it could drive more climate lawsuits in national and international courts and influence lawmakers to enact stricter environmental policies. The Times stated that lawyers managing the case expect the court to issue its opinion in summer. While the world awaits the results of the international hearing, climate trials in the U.S. have already led to positive change. In 2023, a group of young activists won a landmark lawsuit in Montana when a judge ruled that it was unconstitutional for the state to approve dirty fuel projects without considering the climate impacts. According to Reuters, a group of young people in Hawai'i also claimed victory after the state agreed to decarbonize its transportation system by 2045. As more people use their voices to push for climate action, we get one step closer to a cleaner, greener future.

""As nations all over the world look to decarbonize in the lead-up to net zero deadlines, it's only right that our highways, byways and motorways get the full sustainability treatment too,"" Sustainability Magazine recently wrote. Among those ready to start such treatment: Swedish construction firm Skanska and Switzerland-based Holcim, known to develop sustainable building materials. Together, they are working toward modernizing the United Kingdom's busiest highway, the M25, using recycled aggregates and low-carbon concrete expected to lower Skanska's carbon pollution by 40% against traditional methods. ""The M25 enhancements, which involved widening portions of the road and improving junctions, featured the recycled materials onsite, diminishing the necessity for extensive material transport and thus lowering the overall project emissions,"" the report said. According to Holcim, its ""ECOPact"" low-carbon concrete can cut carbon pollution by up to 90% compared with standard options. Foundation HEKS/EPER, however, underlined that the company's labeling of its ECOPact range as ""green concrete"" was misleading in a 2023 report. Besides, its offsetting of unavoidable pollution from related products does not mean reducing them. But if taking precautions to not fall into corporations' greenwashing trap is essential, Skanska's M25 project is going in the right direction. Initiatives like these can help decarbonize a sector that generates nearly 40% of global emissions, as U.N. data shows. The world's most consumed material on earth after water, concrete has a substantial carbon footprint. ""The M25 is getting a green upgrade. … And it's more than just a road improvement,"" a LinkedIn post read. ""Recycled tarmac, low-carbon cement, and even reused materials like plastics and glass are paving the way (literally) for greener roads."" The first building to use 100% recycled concrete was borne out of a partnership between French social housing developer Seqens and Holcim. It's called the Recygénie, and it's in Paris. And it should soon be joined by plenty of others. In the U.S., New York City and Los Angeles have recently agreed to produce and use low-carbon cement in infrastructure. Obviously, building less remains key to reducing the impacts of human-made infrastructure on the environment — as the heated debate around the construction of the A69 highway in the south of France over the past few months has illustrated.

Garland announced in 2022 that he was tapping Special Counsel Jack Smith to investigate alleged attempts by Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election results. Although Garland said his decision at the time was based on Trump announcing his bid for the presidency, some Democrats said the Jan. 6 committee findings should have been more than enough to launch an investigation. ""Garland only started the prosecution after he was in effect forced to by the report of the Jan. 6 committee and the criminal referral,"" New York Rep. Jerrold Nadler told HuffPost. ""The evidence the Jan. 6 committee used was available from the beginning."" ""Had they proceeded with those prosecutions, I think he would have been convicted and we’d have a different president now,"" he added. ""Merrick Garland wasted a year."" Mehdi Hasan Says He Will 'Never' Forgive Biden For Not Weaponizing Doj To Put Trump On Trial Before Election California Rep.

Read On The Fox News App ""I didn’t realize that they were not looking at the whole picture,"" Lofgren told HuffPost. ""I think they were taking a look at the foot soldiers."" California Sen. Adam Schiff was more critical, telling HuffPost that the Department of Justice (DOJ) ""moved with expedition when it came to the people who broke into the building, but were those at a higher level, they waited almost a year on."" ""That was a fatal mistake,"" Schiff said. Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith agreed, saying, ""I think the department was so focused on being kind of by the book and being so clear that there wasn’t any political interference."" She added, ""I really worry that, you know, he’ll become president, and he’s going to pardon a bunch of people and [a] great sort of whitewashing of what happened will continue."" President Biden himself reportedly regretted choosing Garland as attorney general, also believing that he moved too slowly in prosecuting Trump.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/toxic-masculinity-links-orleans-attacker-110006595.html,Toxic masculinity links the New Orleans attacker and the Las Vegas bomber,,Opinion,Salon,7 min read,"Whether MAGA or ISIS, troubled men are getting sucked in by hateful online propaganda",Amanda Marcotte,2025-01-06T11:00:06.000Z,"As I noted in passing last week, the striking thing about the life of Shamsud-Din Jabbar is how much it reads like the boilerplate biography of any random Jan. 6 defendant or MAGA-inspired criminal. The 42-year-old who allegedly murdered 15 people at the New Year's festivities in New Orleans appeared, on paper, to be relatively successful in his career: 8 years in the Army, a degree from Georgia State, and a $125,000 a year job for an accounting firm. But his personal life was a mess. He was thrice divorced in 10 years, and at least two of the divorces were acrimonious and required repeat court interference. His divorce lawyer even fired him. His financial mismanagement meant his healthy salary didn't go far enough, and he had to be forced to make back payments on child support. Like so many men facing personal troubles, Jabbar didn't get the help he needed. Instead, he turned to radicalizing voices online, which led him to believe that he needed to double down on toxic masculinity. It's a story we hear over and over, from so-called incels who commit mass shootings to Donald Trump fans who attack government buildings to terrorists imbibing ISIS propaganda. Rather than taking responsibility for their personal failures and striving to do better, men of all stripes turn to the internet where they're greeted by a sea of influencers, ready to tell them that it's other people — women, people of different races or religions, the ""woke mob"" — that is to blame. In some cases, as happened here, they go far enough down the rabbit hole that they talk themselves into violence. Thankfully, no one but the bomber was badly hurt in the Las Vegas suicide bombing that happened the same night as the Bourbon St. attack, but the parallels between Jabbar and Matthew Livelsberger aren't hard to spot. Like Jabbar, Livelsberger was a troubled man who picked a highly symbolic location, blowing up a Cybertruck in front of a Trump hotel. Both men had checkered romantic histories, and Livelsberger appears to have told multiple people he feared he suffered from PTSD. Like Jabbar, Livelsberger seems to have acted on a belief that he was going out like a hero, standing up for his far-right ideology and using his death to call on fellow MAGA believers to commit acts of terrorism. ""Try peaceful means first, but be prepared to fight to get the Dems out of the fed government and military by any means necessary,"" he wrote in his final manifesto. He declared the U.S. is ""terminally ill and headed toward collapse,"" complained that people don't believe ""[m]asculinity is good and men must be leaders"" and made tired Twitter jokes calling Vice President Kamala Harris a ""DEI candidate"" and President Joe Biden ""Weekend at Bernie's."" He concluded, ""Rally around the Trump, Musk, Kennedy, and ride this wave to the highest hegemony for all Americans!"" Want more Amanda Marcotte on politics? Subscribe to her newsletter Standing Room Only. Livelsberger defensively insisted the bombing ""was not a terrorist attack."" This sentiment is belied not just by the violence of the act itself and his calls for MAGA men to use violence because ""a hard reset must occur for our country."" Friday, the Washington Post published an in-depth report on the role self-radicalization plays in ISIS violence. In many cases, reporters Souad Mekhennet and Joby Warrick write, ""the perpetrators appear to have been driven less by ideology or politics than by rage over personal failings."" They largely follow the story of Beran Aliji, the 19-year-old Austrian whose plot to attack a Taylor Swift concert was thankfully thwarted by authorities. The contours of his story are familiar to anyone who knows examples like Elliot Rodger, the UCSB incel killer, or Jacob Chansley, the infamous ""QAnon Shaman"" at the Jan. 6 riot. Aliji was a lost soul with few friends and serious mental health issues. Instead of getting help for his issues, Aliji turned to online sources that promoted toxic masculinity. He embraced overt misogyny and developed an obsession with guns and knives, telling police he posed for photos with weapons because he ""wanted to be cool and brag about it."" Aliji's brand of toxic masculinity was radical Islamic propaganda, which eventually led him to ISIS, which he saw ""as a means of gaining an identity and purpose."" There are many flavors of this pitch aimed at lost men worldwide. In the U.S., groups like the Proud Boys offer a similar tactic: Join them, and you'll be transformed from a nobody to a warrior fighting for the supposedly noble MAGA cause. Online incel communities are less positive in their marketing but push a similar message, that the world is a fallen place and only this group of men see the truth of it. Christian nationalist churches, such as the one attended by Trump's Defense Secretary nominee Pete Hegeseth, pump out huge amounts of online content valorizing male violence and female oppression. A lot of people fall into these radical communities after imbibing months or even years of ""softer"" versions of the same ""feminism is bad, toxic masculinity is good"" messaging from influencers like Jordan Peterson, Matt Walsh, or Ben Shapiro. Whether it's radical Islam or MAGA vitriol, the appeal is obvious. They allow the troubled man to blame others, especially women and ""woke"" culture, rather than look to themselves. They offer a false promise that their ideologies will transform followers from losers to heroes. What they actually sell them is more of the same poison that led to their problems in the first place: toxic masculinity. They're encouraged to be domineering toward women and bombastic in their rigid worldviews, both of which alienate them further from people in their lives. But they often respond by digging even deeper into the radicalizing materials, and all too often, they act out violently. In some cases, as with Aliji or the would-be Pizzagate shooter, they're stopped before anyone gets hurt. All too often, they're not. Right now, most media focus on men and online radicalization focuses on the ""demand"" side of the equation, looking at the psychological factors that drive men to seek out these influences. That's important, but sources I spoke with last year for an in-depth report on radicalization also felt attention must be paid to the ""supply"" side. American University professor Brian Hughes explained that pre-internet, it was relatively rare ""to encounter extremist propaganda or an extremist recruiter."" With the internet, however, ""you can't avoid radicalizing material. Propaganda is everywhere."" More will likely be learned about Jabbar, but what we already know suggests he's part of this larger trend. Bruce Riedel, a counterterrorism expert, told the Washington Post that Jabbar is ""a classic case"" of someone who ""finds now a cause to justify his life and his rage"" in the radical Islamic ideology he found online. After an initial investigation into whether Jabbar had accomplices, federal authorities have determined he acted alone and was ""inspired"" by ISIS propaganda. Similarly, while Livelsberger hinted at his intent to friends and an ex-girlfriend, he ultimately seemed self-directed. Like Jabbar, he appears to have been lost and felt that this final act of violence would give him meaning. His letter suggests he believes he'll be a hero to men who share his radical political views. Both men were caught up in the sick logic of toxic masculinity, where being ""good"" is about being dominant and hateful. It's a worldview that reimagines ugly behavior as noble, and it's not a surprise it so often ends in violence.",1.2k,[],2025-01-06 13:51:51,2025-01-06 20:20:23
https://www.yahoo.com/news/secret-weapon-fight-against-trump-110000689.html,A Secret Weapon in the Fight Against Trump: Better Public Transit,,US,The New Republic,5 min read,"The right knows that safe, efficient public transit could be a potent political tool for leftists. That’s why conservatives stoke backlash to public transit every chance they get.",Liza Featherstone,2025-01-06T11:00:00.000Z,"As climate activists mourn the November election and steel themselves for a second Trump presidency, a small, countervailing trend seems to be emerging at the local level: Leftists championing public transit are running for office and winning. Last month, Mike Siegel won a City Council seat in Austin, Texas, on a platform heavily focused on climate issues, including transit, promising to support and protect a popular plan currently underway to add a new light rail system, and expand commuter rail and bus service throughout the city. He also supported improvements and extensions to a major transit hub. Even in suburban Atlanta—not a place associated with rail or bus-riding culture, where a public transit referendum unfortunately lost in November—Gabriel Sanchez  won his election for state representative in a landslide after making transit central to his campaign. Meanwhile, in New York City, congestion pricing began on Sunday. After years of advocacy, litigation, and gubernatorial shenanigans, New York is set to charge motorists for entering the city, using the tax to improve public transportation. Building better public transit is a key plank in socialist New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign too. Mamdani, promising “fast, fare-free buses,” raised a quarter of a million dollars in the first three weeks of his campaign, making him the fastest mayoral candidate in 2024’s growing mayoral field to reach that milestone. Public transit, done right, could be politically powerful: Not only does it solve multiple policy problems at once—making cities more affordable and easier to navigate, while curbing pollution and addressing the climate crisis—but it offers a way to improve people’s lives materially, in easy-to-perceive ways, on a daily basis. That’s crucial for building further political support, both for climate policy and for public investments of all kinds. There’s every reason to believe voters will appreciate these policies: A recent study of eight major global cities found that 80 percent of people would rather use a well-connected transit system than drive. Even in Washington, D.C., the only American city in the survey, and the one with the most motorists, more than half said they’d prefer quality transit to their car. And it’s obvious that many people prefer to live near good public transit; in most cities and suburbs, access to good transit makes a neighborhood more desirable, as measured by rents, incomes, and small businesses. Conservatives, meanwhile, seem to know just how politically powerful the promise of good public transit can be. That’s why they devote so much energy to portraying the New York City subway—the best one in the United States—as a Dante-esque inferno of horrors. The problems of public transportation have become a right-wing obsession, similar to the demonization of public schools (another popular and successful form of socialism, however flawed). Some recent awful crimes—one subway rider killed another by setting her on fire as she slept last month, while another, on New Year’s Eve, was shoved onto the tracks, suffering serious injuries—have been amplified nonstop by conservative media like the New York Post. Right-wing politicians are eager to fuel this narrative of the dangerous subway too. Take the story of Jordan Neely, a mentally ill homeless person who threatened subway riders in New York City, and Daniel Penny, the young Marine who unintentionally killed Neely while holding him in a chokehold in May 2023. A jury ultimately acquitted Penny of criminally negligent homicide—a reasonable finding in a profoundly tragic situation. For the right, though, Penny isn’t merely a bystander in an unenviable situation who accidentally made a horrific scene even worse. To them, Penny is a hero whose story showcases the daily dangers and terrors of public transit: That’s why he’s not just a man returning to private life, but JD Vance’s special guest at the Army-Navy football game last month. Right-wing media has also relentlessly amplified every possible objection to congestion pricing, including the nonsensical statement by a Transport Union local president to the Post that the subway is “too unsafe” to implement congestion pricing. While more than half of New York residents commute to work by public transit, Fox’s local outlet has been vigilantly rounding up angry motorists from New York’s most conservative and least convenient environs, like Long Island and Staten Island. Congestion pricing, done right, will win over many who are now complaining, experience from other cities shows. And as for the other conservative narrative around public transit: Riding the subway is much safer than driving. In fact, measured by deaths per miles traveled, the New York City subway is 10 times safer than driving. And while even a handful of homicides is more than the public should have to deal with, that’s hardly a subway-specific problem. Likewise, while it may be uncomfortable, unpleasant, and sometimes terrifying to share a subway car with people who are mentally ill and don’t have anywhere else to go, that’s a reason to improve housing and social services, not a problem inherent to public transit. Conservatives don’t have any answers to these problems. They are just trying to use these sad and alarming stories to undermine a popular public good, hoping that we will give up on the ideal of clean, safe, and inviting public transit for all. If the left leans into making public transportation great, this right-wing strategy, as savvy as it is, won’t work. Public transit, in fact, offers a general model for political resistance in the second Trump era: Pay attention to the public goods the American right wants to attack and take away—and, instead, make those services better, safer, and less vulnerable to far-right narrative and smear. Conservatives know that public transit is popular—that’s why they’re excited at the opportunity to discredit it. We can learn from this and put public transit and urban civilization at the center of our politics, cleaning up the environment by taking cars off the road, and bringing ease, comfort, and twenty-first-century efficiency to working people everywhere. The right can’t compete with that.",0,[],2025-01-06 13:51:51,2025-01-06 20:20:47
https://www.yahoo.com/news/donald-trump-building-army-foot-110000711.html,Donald Trump Is Building a New Army of Foot Soldiers,,US,The New Republic,8 min read,Neo-Nazis and white nationalists have been emboldened by Trump’s reelection.,Spencer Sunshine,2025-01-06T11:00:00.000Z,"Presidents don’t just wield power directly; they set the mood for the country. It’s not uncommon for their grassroots base to flourish under their administration, as the far right did during Donald Trump’s first term in office. It is less common, however, for that base to remain strong after defeat. But, defying the odds, the MAGA movement continued to flourish under Joe Biden. Now, with Trump returning to the White House, the far right grassroots is barreling into 2025 with plenty of momentum, while their leader both helps set their agenda while sustaining it by crowd-sourcing their conspiracies and lies for his own use. The far right is currently animated by several themes, many of them interrelated. For several years, demonizing “DEI” (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) frameworks—which focus on identities, racial and otherwise—was an obsession. But the far right has gradually replaced DEI with “woke,” a vaguer and broader idea which can refer to the vast majority of left-leaning positions and be applied to any number of hot button, culture war topics. The backlash over gender, sexuality, and reproductive rights continues, with trans issues front-and-center. After Roe v Wade was struck down in 2022, attacks on abortion rights increased. And when Trump was reelected, the slogan “Your Body, My Choice” spread like wildfire after being embraced by far right leaders like Nick Fuentes. Anti-immigrant rhetoric has also increased, particularly as Trump has promised to deport tens of millions. His racist vilification of immigrants was epitomized by his embrace of unfounded rumors that Haitians in Springfield, Ohio—who were, for what it’s worth, legal residents—were stealing and eating pets. Finally, completely discredited “race science” theories have returned, often focusing on bogus IQ studies. Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, has promoted them on his social media platform X, as has Trump, who has blamed violence by immigrants on “bad genes.” Donald Trump has different faces: the tax-cutting businessman, the international negotiator—and the authoritarian strongman. Sometimes he embraces different approaches at different times; mostly, though, he is everything at once: A demagogue and a xenophobe who is committing to cutting taxes for corporations and the wealthy and who pitches himself as the only man who can keep the country—and the world—safe. Campaign promises have included setting up deportation camps for undocumented immigrants—in what he said would be a “bloody story”—and  arresting critics and opponents including Kamala Harris, Mark Zuckerberg, and members of the January 6 House committee. Trump also said he’d consider banning vaccines and claims to have the power to halt congressional budget allocations. His appointments have also been gifts to his far right base. The start of Trump’s first term was largely characterized by a raft of relatively moderate, establishment favorite picks, like Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and chief of staff Reince Preibus. Now, the situation is quite different. Stalwart MAGA congressman Matt Gaetz was initially tapped to be  attorney general until accusations of sex with underage girls quickly sunk him. Tulsi Gabbard, a sympathizer to dictatorships in Syria and Russia, was picked as his  Director of National Intelligence. Arguably the most infamous selection was the appointment of Musk to a proposed advisory commission, DOGE (a reference to a dated internet meme, it stands for the “Department of Government Efficiency”). Musk himself has repeatedly tweeted support for anti-immigrant conspiracy theories and most recently for the Alternative for Germany (AfD), a far right party many consider crypto-Nazis. The far right has two wings. One is openly white supremacist, and is vocally opposed to groups like people of color, Jews, Muslims, and LGBTQ+ people. The other is more moderate in its beliefs; people of color—themselves an increasing part of Trump’s base—are welcome, as are Jews. Both wings overlap in their hatred of “communism” (also a catch-all term for anything to the left of them), embrace of conspiracy theories, contempt for democracy, and desire for traditional social hierarchies. The white supremacists and their moderate cousins often see-saw in popularity, one rising as the other falls. In recent years, the moderates have swung high. Moms for Liberty, which has focused on banning school library books—especially those with LGBTQ+ content but also ones with pro-diversity or antiracist messages—started 2024 with almost 300 chapters. But their influence has waned  as the year went on. The notoriously violent Proud Boys, who played an important role in storming the Capitol four years ago, have faced even tougher times. With their leader Enrique Tarrio serving a twenty-two year sentence for his role in the assault on the Capitol, their scattered chapters now lack cohesion and focus. One exception is the armed militia movement, which is having a mild revival. Hurt by a massive Facebook deplatforming in 2020, Tess Owen recently observed these groups “have been quietly reorganizing, ramping up recruitment and rhetoric” in recent months. Some groups hope to help Trump’s deportation scheme. Conversely, open white supremacists are doing quite well. Active Clubs—white supremacist MMA training gyms—are in full flourish, and have even  expanded overseas. While they’ve had limited public activism, observers worry they could soon transform into a fully-fledged fighting force. A new wave of swastika-waving neo-Nazis has emerged, too. The media-friendly Blood Tribe, who use striking aesthetics and a confrontational approach, were early promoters of the pet-eating rumor. A Columbus, Ohio march by their splinter group Hate Club 1488 grabbed so much attention that even President Biden denounced it. Blood Tribe was only one of three groups that descended on Nashville this year for public events. They were joined by the antisemitic Goyim Defense League, who spent two weeks harassing local residents, as well as Patriot Front, one of the largest U.S. fascist groups. All three groups represent a new, flourishing neo-Nazi movement—one that will likely continue to grow during Trump’s second term. One of the most effective strategies against the far right has been lawsuits. One popular conspiracy theory falsely claimed Georgia election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss illegally counted ballots in the 2020 election. The two women sued former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani for spreading this and won $148 million, which they spent 2024 trying to collect. A similar suit against The Gateway Pundit website was settled out of court. Giuliani, meanwhile, has loudly and repeatedly complained that he is “broke” and “can’t buy food.” Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones’s Infowars media empire, found liable for claiming the Sandy Hook school shooting was fake, is also up for grabs after Jones was ordered to pay $1.5 billion to the victims’ families. In November, Infowars was put to auction, which the satirical website The Onion won (although the purchase was later nullified). VDARE, a White Supremacist anti-immigration project influential on the first Trump administration, had to suspend operations after being fined for refusing to comply with a subpoena. Even with Trump in office, such lawsuits will likely continue to be potent tools against both far right groups and conspiracy theorists. A number of members of prominent white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups were arrested in 2024.  Two Terrorgram Collective members, who helped run several neo-Nazi Telegram channels, were arrested for soliciting the murder of federal officials. A Maniac Murder Cult leader was arrested for planning a mass casualty attack. And Nick Fuentes, whose Groyper movement has an impressive influence on mainstream Republicans, was charged with misdemeanor battery after pepper-spraying a woman who rang his doorbell. Arrests from past, high-profile incidents also continue. Over the past year, several members of the infamous 2017 tiki-torch march in Charlottesville, Virginia were arrested—as have a number of Republican “fake electors” from the 2020 election. The most high-profile arrests and sentences, however, have been related to the January 6, 2021 assault on the U.S. Capitol. Around 300 new people were charged in 2024 (out of a grand total of 1,600); half of these were for “assaulting or impeding law enforcement.” Those sentenced include Taylor Johnatakis, who received seven years, and Proud Boy Marc Bru, who got five. Not forgetting his followers, Trump has promised to pardon some or all of these prisoners. Every day Trump makes more wild claims about what he intends to do. Regardless of what happens, these prisoners are red meat to his base, who see them as “political prisoners” who were arrested for trying to correct an injustice. Pardons for the leaders of violent groups, such as the Proud Boys’ Tarrio, will undoubtedly result in their group’s revival. It will also signal Trump’s approval of street violence, potentially reviving the mass street brawls with antifascists during Trump’s first term, such as those seen in Portland, Oregon. As Far Right grassroots remain mobilized, the next four years will likely be an environment where far right individuals and groups can be fully activated and function as Trump’s foot soldiers—legally or otherwise.",1k,[],2025-01-06 13:51:51,2025-01-06 20:21:18
https://www.yahoo.com/news/weird-time-libertarian-110000679.html,It’s a Weird Time to Be a Libertarian,,Politics,The New Republic,7 min read,"The party is on life support after a pitiful showing in the 2024 election. And while Trump wants to slash taxes and regulations, he also plans to weaponize the government and restrict personal liberty.",Ross Rosenfeld,2025-01-06T11:00:00.000Z,"We’re now less than three weeks from Inauguration Day, and libertarians are anxious. On the one hand, the return of Donald Trump to the Oval Office represents the fulfillment of much of what they’ve been preaching for many years in terms of free markets and lower tax rates; on the other, it’s a threat to their very core beliefs about individual freedom and government overreach. The foundation of libertarian ideology rests largely on two premises: first, that maintaining more individual freedom is an inherent good and should be the ultimate objective of every policy, and second, that government interference in the economy is generally bad and should be avoided. Libertarian economists argue that markets are most efficient, and can do the most good, when the government takes a laissez-faire approach, as any government action is likely to cause unintentional harms—something known as the cobra effect. They are free market absolutists and civil liberty absolutists. So what, then, are they to make of a president-elect who vows to lower corporate tax rates yet threatens to raise tariffs, will seek to abolish vaccine mandates while imposing Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s personal dietary beliefs on food producers, and will reduce the government’s regulation of the economy while jeopardizing free speech? For many libertarian leaders, both within the Libertarian Party and among the ranks of the literati at the Cato Institute who serve as the movement’s intellectual base, Trump’s autocratic tendencies overshadow his preferences for deregulation and lower taxes. Yet Trump and RFK Jr. succeeded in driving a wedge in the party and culling votes from its nominee, Chase Oliver, who, despite campaigning in all 50 states, failed to get half of 1 percent of the vote in 2024. “There’s a division here,” Oliver acknowledged to me recently. “Some people in our party leadership think it’s better to kind of be the J.V. league for the Republican Party and be a feeder league for them and try to play in concert with the two-party system.” Yet he notes that the Libertarian Party was founded for a reason; it represents an ideology that does not fit tidily with either the Republicans or Democrats but has agreements and disagreements with both. Though he did not mention her by name, one of the “people” Oliver may very well have been referring to is Angela McArdle, the party chairwoman. According to party Secretary Caryn Ann Harlos, McArdle first met with Trump a year before the election when he invited her to Mar-a-Lago. Trump later accepted her invitation to seek the Libertarian nomination at the party’s convention in May, but his speech was met with boos, and he was disqualified after failing to file the necessary paperwork. Nonetheless, since the election, McArdle has been unapologetic about what she perceives as the potential for progress under a second Trump administration, including Trump’s promise to free Ross Ulbricht, the operator of the Silk Road black market platform, and to appoint a libertarian to his Cabinet (a promise McArdle believes he’s fulfilling with the nomination of RFK Jr., though Oliver and others don’t view the political scion as a legitimate libertarian). Harlos, though suspicious of Trump, also said she’s “optimistic” about the future, while admitting that her optimism sometimes clouds her judgment. (She says she truly believed that Gary Johnson could win in 2016. He finished with just over 3 percent of the vote.) Oliver, on the other hand, is firmly in the pessimistic camp. “I think there will be some things on the fringes that we might celebrate,” he said. “Things like ending regulation.” But he added, “I think it’s important for us to recognize what regulation is ending. Is it regulation that puts some sort of a safeguard or oversight on things that Elon Musk wants to be doing?” (This is not purely hypothetical. Prior to the election, The New York Times analyzed the vast, interconnected nature of Musk’s businesses and the government, revealing a multitude of possible conflicts of interest that could arise from Musk’s new role.) While concerned about Trump’s second term, Oliver said he is hopeful that once Trump starts mucking everything up, the Libertarian Party can emerge as a viable alternative. Harvard economist Jeffrey Miron, vice president for research at Cato and a Substacker, likewise argues that Trump’s chaos might make libertarianism more appealing to the general public. “I guess,” Miron said, “that he’s going to be good for it because I think the next four years may illustrate how inconsistent his perspective is.” Miron pointed to the fact that Trump is appointing “finance bros” and Wall Street types to his Cabinet while threatening to drastically increase tariffs if his trade demands remain unmet. “It’s hard to imagine those people really wanting to impose 10 percent tariffs,” he says, since such an action could prove disastrous to their bottom lines. Miron fears that Trump’s policies, rather than genuinely helping the working class by increasing prosperity for all, will instead redistribute benefits to those who have offered him the most support, and it’s evident that right now Trump’s most dependent on the tech billionaire class. Miron’s even bigger concern, though, is that Trump “seems to think he gets to decide on his own, rather than recognizing the limits on presidential powers, constitutional constraints, etc.” Miron’s colleague at Cato, professor Ilya Somin of George Mason University, has frequently written about libertarian priorities and how political ignorance can undermine democracy. He’s even less cheery about libertarian prospects—and overall prosperity—under another Trump administration. “I think potential beneficial effects of a second Trump administration (mostly in the area of microeconomic regulation) are likely to be much outweighed by his terrible policies on trade, immigration, and government spending,” he told me by email, “and by his plans to undermine freedom of the press. Much depends, of course, on how successful he is in trying to carry out his plans.” He added, “For the moment, I’m sort of in a pessimistic mood, but I hope I’m wrong.” Somin does not believe that libertarianism needs a giant overhaul, but he does advocate for tweaking it in ways that don’t violate its core principles yet make it more broadly appealing. Though some issues are sacrosanct (such as organ markets, which Somin and many other libertarians support), libertarians need not be absolutists in every regard, he says. Though libertarians would prefer to see all zoning laws abolished, an easing of zoning restrictions is at least a step in the right direction. Somin pointed to the successes of the Yimby movement, which has made it possible for more affordable housing units to be built. And rather than push for total “open borders,” which is a distasteful term to much of the public, Somin says, they can accept compromises that will allow more immigrants into the country. Oliver, too, believes that you have to work on a case-by-case basis and take what victories you can. “Maybe it’ll be a hard time identifying those ethical Republicans and Democrats who want to improve the process. But once we identify them, we want to support them when they do put legislation out there, we want to amplify their voices when they do things we agree with,” he said. “There is a certain amount of pragmatism in not letting the perfect be the enemy of the good. Recognizing that you might not get 100 percent of the libertarian utopian ideal, but you can still move the ball forward in terms of liberty.” Of course, the problem is that, in Trump, libertarians are dealing with someone whose nature is entirely transactional and who has no real ideological core. It means that, while libertarians might be able to achieve certain objectives by working with him and his acolytes, they can never be sure that they’re not undermining their beliefs in civil liberties by strengthening Trump’s position. Any victory you give to Trump could mean putting another nail in your own coffin. Harlos essentially acknowledged this, fearful that the Libertarian Party might get devoured as it struggles to distinguish itself. “I do believe that the Libertarian Party is in an existential crisis for its identity and existence,” she said. “And the people who want us to remain a distinctly libertarian movement are prepared to fight for it.”",1,[],2025-01-06 13:51:51,2025-01-06 20:19:45
https://www.yahoo.com/news/shadowy-millions-behind-san-francisco-110000945.html,The Shadowy Millions Behind San Francisco’s “Moderate” Politics,,US,The New Republic,32 min read,"The city is the epicenter of an anti-progressive movement—financed by the ultrawealthy—that aims to blur political lines and centralize power for the long term. For some, their ambitions don’t stop there.",Laura Jedeed,2025-01-06T11:00:00.000Z,"“There’s a hole. Smack in the middle.” Mark Dietrich pointed at a brown garage door across the street. Someone has taken a hand drill to it, just above eye level. “They reach through with a wire or a coat hanger, and then there’s a little red handle. As soon you pull that red handle, the garage [door] goes right up.” Dietrich is an analytics executive and San Francisco anti-crime activist, with a bike rider’s build and a close-cropped business haircut. We were walking around his Inner Richmond neighborhood, a lovely place with modest homes that cost millions of dollars. It does not look like it has a crime problem, but appearances can be deceiving. “I don’t think there’s a business here that hasn’t been broken into in the past two or three years,” he told me. “Maybe the bank?” If you’ve paid attention to the media in the last couple of years, you’ve probably read an article that begins a lot like this one. It probably went on to inform you that San Francisco is dying horribly, the once-great metropolis destroyed by progressive policy madness. Tent encampments fruit like mushrooms upon its rotting corpse, and the addicts who crouch within them purchase fentanyl at what the Hoover Institution described as “an opioid version of Costco.” The streets are paved with needles and human excrement, while roving gangs of criminals steal everything in sight. The Washington Examiner compared it unfavorably to Planet of the Apes. The Atlantic called it “a failed city.” In 2023, Michael Moritz, a former journalist turned billionaire venture capitalist, wrote a guest editorial for The New York Times entitled “Even Democrats Like Me Are Fed Up With San Francisco.” “SF has a drug problem. SF has a cleanliness problem. SF has an education problem. SF has an anti-tech problem,” venture capitalist Garry Tan said in a taped speech entitled “Fixing San Francisco” at 2023’s Network State Conference. “SF has a fundamentally political problem. So the question is: How do we solve it?” Tan, Moritz, and others involved in the city’s self-described moderate movement believe they have an answer. They have founded or sponsored groups with generically liberal-sounding names like Grow SF (Tan), TogetherSF (Moritz), and Neighbors for a Better San Francisco and have poured millions into local politics to advance solutions they often describe as “common sense.” Though the real estate titans, conservative philanthropists, and tech bros who fund these projects don’t see eye to eye on everything, they share a common and often obfuscated goal: to create a centralized political machine powerful enough to transform the city into a regulation-free, heavily policed paradise for the wealthy. Twenty years ago, many people recognized these ideas as reactionary. After two consecutive election cycles in which Democrats primarily ran on a platform of not being Donald Trump, however, ideas and governing philosophies have taken a back seat to questions of loyalty. The tech elite in San Francisco aim to redraw political lines so that conservatives can feel at home on both sides, and progressives are boxed out of politics as dangerous communist radicals. But progressives aren’t the actual radicals in this story. That moniker belongs to some key players at the top of this “commonsense” movement—those who yearn to replace nation-states with anarcho-capitalist “startup societies” ruled by philosopher-king CEOs. The impracticality of such pipe dreams does not stop them from pouring resources into the project, and the results are painfully real.  I recently visited San Francisco in search of the failed city I’d heard so much about. Aside from a few awful blocks in the Tenderloin district, most of its streets looked clean enough to eat off, at least in my New York City eyes. The tent encampments I’d been promised largely failed to materialize, and I braved BART and Muni without a single unpleasant experience. San Francisco has the highest retail and office space vacancy rates in the country, but also had the highest rate of remote work in 2021, at 35 percent. Today, it stands at 20.5 percent, still far higher than the national average. Most departing businesses cited either this trend or downsizing, not crime, as the reason for their exodus—and the AI boom has started to fill the space they left behind. Tourists and residents walked without fear in the warm September sun, and, statistically speaking, they were correct to do so; San Francisco has a significantly lower rate of violent crime than the national average for large U.S. cities. But the city is not paradise either. Nearly a quarter of San Franciscans pay more than 50 percent of their income to keep a roof over their heads, placing them one emergency away from eviction. Nearly one of every hundred residents experienced homelessness in 2022. Drug overdoses are far higher than the national average, and while I did not find any fentanyl farmer’s markets, I did find curated human misery at the heart of the Tenderloin. People with nowhere to go stood in line, or sat on the curb, or lay on the sidewalk in a stupor. Several openly smoked fentanyl using foil and a straw—something I’d never seen before, even in New York. “The people lying on the ground passed out from fentanyl, that’s new,” Jim Stearns, the political consultant who worked on progressive mayoral candidate Aaron Peskin’s campaign, told me. “It really makes you feel like there’s something wrong with the world, when you see that.” The city also has an extremely high property crime rate: 41 percent higher than the national average as of 2020. Dietrich believes this number is probably low. Stearns agrees. “My girlfriend had her car window smashed three times since she moved in with me a year ago, and we’re not reporting that. [The statistic] going up or down is accurate. But what is being reported as the absolute amount of car break-ins is probably nowhere near accurate.” Back in Inner Richmond, Dietrich and I popped into what is known as the most shoplifted Walgreens in the country, before circling back toward his house. “The CNN narrative or the Fox News narrative [is]: San Francisco is a hellhole. And as residents, we’re so torn,” he told me. “Is this a hellhole? No. It’s beautiful. But at the same time, is the crime real, and is it way worse than it’s been? Yes.” He pointed across the street. “There’s a garage that’s been broken into. You can see it’s been boarded up.” The problem is real, but is it worse now than it has been in the past? Property crime rose steadily in Richmond from 2020 to 2022, but last year rates fell to the lowest they’ve been since 2017. By 2023, this neighborhood still had one of the lowest property crime rates in San Francisco. Then again, statistics like these mean little to those on the wrong side of them, and visible crimes leave visceral impressions. People remember a boarded-up garage, a smashed car window, or thieves breaking into businesses by driving a car through the front windows, as happened to a bank in Outer Richmond in January and a Central Richmond cigarette shop in June. Numbers and percentages are abstract. Battering-ram robberies stick with you. Dietrich’s own garage feels a bit like Fort Knox for bicycles—he’s an avid rider and owns several. He’s reinforced the grates on his garage door so no one can kick them in, and a small plastic shield protects the red emergency tab from wayward coat hangers. Two dead bolts on either side of the door snap shut as soon as the door lowers. And if all else fails? “When you pull your car in, you park it close to the back. When you lock up your bikes, you use a New York City level bike chain.” This isn’t the only vehicle vault on these blocks; Dietrich has helped many neighbors secure their garages over the years. He’s not afraid to confront people on the street, either—Dietrich recently made the news for filming a break-in and enduring a barrage of Brazilian heavy cream for his trouble. He is, as one might expect, a prominent and polarizing figure on Nextdoor. “Remember Bewitched? I’m kind of a Gladys Kravitz type. I’m like, what’s going on?” he says. You could call it nosiness, but you could also call it community-mindedness, and it’s an impulse that extends beyond his immediate neighbors. A popular form of property crime in San Francisco (dubbed “bipping” by locals) involves breaking windows of rental cars by Fisherman’s Wharf, stealing tourists’ luggage, removing anything with resale value, then dumping the remainder off the first highway exit—which leads straight into Inner Richmond. “That’s somebody’s stuff, somebody’s vacation,” Dietrich said. “Eighty percent of the time, there’s passports in it. I’ve met people from all over the planet just by returning their stolen luggage.” These are real problems, and understandably distressing to the people who live here. And yet, it does not explain why one of the safest major cities in the country manifests as an irredeemable hellhole in the national imagination. Every city has a Tenderloin to some degree. Of America’s 25 largest cities, San Francisco had the fourth-highest rate of property crime and the highest percentage of unhoused people in 2022, but people experience homelessness and crime at high rates across the United States. Nashville had approximately the same overdose rate as San Francisco in 2022, and its violent crime rate was nearly three times higher. And yet when was the last time you read a national article about the failed city of Nashville? San Francisco’s real and serious problems cannot explain its place within 2020s American mythology. Who, then, are the mythmakers?  It is 4 p.m. on the last Saturday in September, and Folsom Street is already beginning to transform in preparation for its infamous street fair the following day. I pass twinks in leather puppy masks walking alongside—or being walked by—bears in harnesses. A large man in assless chaps stands on a street corner. I am not wearing chaps, assless or otherwise. I am wearing a Day-Glo vest and holding a large orange bag in one hand, a trash picker in the other. This is Refuse Refuse’s weekly trash pickup in the South of Market neighborhood, one of several weekly cleanups across the city. You can find these events on Refuse Refuse’s website, but the sign-up links lead to a website run by TogetherSF, where I dutifully registered. We pick up trash in pairs. My partner in cleanliness is an older man with a British accent. He does this around his own neighborhood, too, he tells me. When he sees people doing drugs in public, he politely asks them to go somewhere a bit more private. They usually listen. People just want to be treated like people, he says. We discuss the ways that lack of permanent shelter compounds mental illness and drives people deeper into addiction (or starts them along that path in the first place). I am moved and inspired by his compassion. But a few days later, I began to receive emails from TogetherSF that pushed a very different narrative. The emails urged me to vote for the organization’s chosen mayoral candidate, Mark Farrell, whose platform includes sending armed National Guard members into the Tenderloin and relaxing affordable housing requirements. The missives included an invitation to door-knock for Farrell, a voting guide that promised to “fix SF,” and a robust defense of Farrell against several accusations of campaign finance fraud. I didn’t need the door-knocking invitation; I’d already attended a weekly canvassing, jointly hosted by Farrell’s campaign and TogetherSF Action, the organization’s 501(c)(4) lobbying arm. The canvassers knocked doors both for Farrell and Prop D, TogetherSF’s pet piece of legislation promising to streamline bureaucracy by eliminating redundant commissions. The kickoff did not mention that Prop D would also give the mayor near-total control over the remaining commissions, at the expense of the Board of Supervisors. “My super-quick pitch: I think San Francisco can do better,” said Terry Whalen, the canvasser I shadowed, after exchanging pleasantries with the woman who answered the door. “We need a new sheriff in town. Part of that public safety, you know?” The woman listened with some interest as Whalen briefly summarized Farrell’s background—served on the city Board of Supervisors for seven years, went into the private sector (“to make some money, like a normal person”), then returned when the city began to fall apart. “I’ve known him for a long time. We sent kids to the same school,” he said. “I’m voting Farrell number one. And then, we have to do ranked choice, so I’m voting [Daniel] Lurie number two, because I think Lurie could also be good.” The mainly self-funded eventual winner, Lurie, philanthropist and heir to the Levi Strauss fortune, was one of three self-declared “moderate” candidates in the race, along with Farrell and incumbent London Breed. Thanks to ranked-choice voting, splitting the moderate vote wasn’t necessarily a death sentence for “commonsense” governance. The important thing was to thwart the mayoral ambitions of longtime city supervisor and small-donor-funded Aaron Peskin—or “Poison Peskin,” as Whalen called him. Whalen is an affable man who lives just down the street from Dietrich—in fact, Whalen’s the one who introduced us. He’s new to political activism; with his kids in college, he now has more time to get involved. Like everyone to whom I spoke for this article, he wants his city to be safer, cleaner, better. Farrell’s solutions seem like common sense, while progressive policy strikes him as “bizarro world”—both incomprehensible and dangerous. The policies that worry him include defunding the police, a refusal to arrest drug dealers, and the elimination of middle school algebra in the name of social justice. I was skeptical of that last claim, but when I googled it, there it was: The San Francisco school board really did banish algebra from middle schools in 2014 in the name of closing a racial achievement gap. Not only did that gap remain, but private schools that offered middle school algebra widened the gap between the wealthy and merely affluent. The school board approved the restoration of eighth-grade algebra in 2024. The policy is enough to make any parent apoplectic, but does not explain the timing of the backlash, which started seven years after the algebra measure passed. The statewide law that reduced penalties for property crimes and drug infractions also passed in 2014. Car break-ins began to spike in 2011 and reached their peak in 2017. Overdose deaths first soared above the national average in 2018. And yet, San Francisco’s doom loop narrative didn’t take hold until early 2021. Why? Covid, not algebra, sparked the San Francisco school board recall, which many also regard as the beginning of the city’s political pendulum swing. By 2021, most private schools were back to in-person learning, but public schools were not. Rather than working on a plan to safely reopen, the school board voted to rename 44 schools named for people whom a slipshod, Wikipedia-based study declared problematic: people like Paul Revere, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Dianne Feinstein. The timing could not have been worse. A few weeks later, Autumn Looijen and Siva Raj began to organize a recall campaign against three school board members and found allies in two recently created organizations: GrowSF and Neighbors for a Better San Francisco. The latter group contributed nearly $470,000 of the campaign’s $2 million war chest. David Sacks, a Republican tech billionaire who supports both JD Vance and Trump, gave the fifth-largest donation, at $75,000. Between parental frustration and being outspent 22 to one, the incumbents never had a chance. On February 15, 2022, San Franciscans gave all three members the boot. “There was an authentic populist revolt,” Eric Jaye, a San Francisco political consultant who’s worked for decades with both progressive and moderate candidates, told me. “They were just parents asking the question, ‘Why are my kids not back in school?’” Next in moderates’ crosshairs was District Attorney Chesa Boudin, who was narrowly elected in 2019 on a platform of harm reduction and judicial reform. Like many cities, San Francisco stopped jailing people for low-level offenses during Covid, and Boudin kicked off a program that allowed some offenders to undergo supervised treatment and classes as an alternative to jail. Research indicates that these types of diversionary programs are more effective than incarceration at preventing recidivism, but Boudin’s opposition used the $7 million in their coffers to paint him as more sympathetic to criminals than victims. Two-thirds of that money came from Neighbors for a Better San Francisco, whose $4.7 million donation vastly overshadowed the second-largest contributor, a real estate PAC that gave $250,000. Boudin supporters raised $3 million to push back against the narrative, but voters decisively fired him in June 2022. Thus emboldened, anti-progressive groups pivoted from the Boudin recall into the November 2022 Board of Supervisors elections. TogetherSF launched a “voter’s guide” and began to host house parties on behalf of its chosen candidates, especially the victorious Joel Engardio, who had helped organize the school board recall and served as executive director of Stop Crime SF, a group that advocates for tougher sentencing and against “lenient” judges. That group received $750,000 from Neighbors for a Better San Francisco in 2021. Going into 2023, the anti-progressives were not only three for three at the ballot box, but they were exerting indirect policy pressure, too. Then-Mayor London Breed, who called for defunding the police in 2020, began calling for increased police presence and incarceration for drug users. And yet, tales of San Francisco’s imminent demise became even more commonplace. Nine major “doom loop” articles were published that year. San Francisco was still failing, and progressives—in control only of the Board of Supervisors—were still completely at fault. The narrative (along with funding from the Abundance Network) helped fuel the March 2024 takeover of the San Francisco Democratic County Central Committee, or DCCC—a quiet but major victory for anti-progressives that allowed them to bestow the official party endorsements for candidates and ballot measures going forward. “If you call yourself progressive, it’s almost a dirty word. You’re putting yourself in a category which is politically outside, because it’s been dehumanized,” Jeff Olsen, an IT security expert and native San Franciscan, told me. “That was not the case eight years ago, or five years ago. Through it all, the anti-progressive groups have pushed a “normal versus bizarro” framework that has proved useful in painting progressives not as fellow residents with different ideas, but as dangerous wackos outside the bounds of acceptability. It’s the kind of thing that short-circuits discussion, a good-versus-evil battle that feels all too familiar in American politics writ large. “If you call yourself progressive, it’s almost a dirty word. You’re putting yourself in a category which is politically outside, because it’s been dehumanized,” Jeff Olsen, an IT security expert and native San Franciscan, told me over coffee. “That was not the case eight years ago, or five years ago.” Apart from being incredibly unpleasant, such rhetoric actively hinders efforts to fix things. In 2022, for example, Mayor Breed launched the Linkage Center in the Tenderloin, a facility intended to connect unhoused people with shelter and treatment options. Drug users could smoke or inject within the facility, where medics stood by to intervene in case of overdose. “Four hundred people a day were coming in,” then-Supervisor Dean Preston told me. “Zero people died in 11 months, and all overdoses were reversed. Absolute success.” But not everyone felt that way. While over a quarter of the 124,000 people who visited the site received some form of assistance, almost none of that involved help with mental illness or addiction, partly because harm reduction opposes pushing treatment before users are ready, and partly because of the city’s chronic shortage of treatment facilities. Critics claimed the center was more interested in facilitating drug use than in helping people get clean. The city’s 2022 overdose prevention plan, endorsed by the Board of Supervisors and (sometimes) Breed herself, called for expanded treatment capacity and “wellness hubs” in several other neighborhoods. By 2023, under immense political pressure, Breed shut the facility down, refused to open a replacement facility, and called for a pivot toward incarceration. “No serious public health or policy person thinks that running around and arresting people … is a sensible way to address drug addiction,” Preston told me. “Arresting them does nothing. It makes them more likely to die from an overdose when they get out.” Studies back this up, and so did results in San Francisco. The city’s overdose rate reached an all-time high in 2023, even as the national rate went down. The bizarro-world strategy wasn’t so crazy after all, it seems, even one imperfectly implemented. Preston had hoped San Francisco could implement the Zurich model, with its four pillars of prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and enforcement, adding, “I’m not against having a law enforcement component to this.” But the city’s commitment was temporary and incomplete. “What you’re really seeing is a lack of consensus around executing a holistic plan. Instead, you have government operating by press release—you get whiplash.” Preston is the first Democratic Socialist to serve on the Board of Supervisors in nearly 30 years, and the anti-progressive movement’s public enemy number one. And yet Mark Dietrich, who wants to increase both police presence and arrests, also believes harm reduction is necessary, as part of a larger program. “You have to get people into the help they need to save their lives. If you’re going to have injection sites, their whole mission has to be to get people into treatment and recovery,” he told me. “That hasn’t happened at all.” Dietrich and Preston don’t agree on everything, but they agree on enough to have a conversation. Nevertheless, in a climate in which invective triumphs over nuance, it seems unlikely they’ll have it. “I think it’s part of a concerted strategy to divide San Francisco politically,” Olsen said. “This is a sophisticated and time-tried strategy of the Republicans to marginalize and divide.”  The anti-progressive movement has exploited wedge issues and fostered a climate of distrust, and one of the most prominent of the “moderate” groups, TogetherSF, makes this strategy explicit—at least behind closed doors. Internal documents leaked to local progressive watchdog organization Phoenix Project, and reported by Mission Local, lay out a four-part plan for “growing an engaged (and enraged) community.” The current phase calls for building engagement through events like holiday celebrations and trash pickups—often run by partner organizations to decenter TogetherSF’s involvement—while its lobbying arm works to “grow and sustain [a] movement of community dissatisfaction” in order to garner support for its ultimate agenda—“changing the structure of SF government.” “They’re [just] getting started, but they’re learning fast,” Julie Pitta, president of the Phoenix Project, told me. “It’s interesting to watch.” In early 2024, Pitta launched the Phoenix Project—which, like many of these groups, is a 501(c)(4)—to track the anti-progressive organizations pouring unprecedented millions into local politics. Its research reveals an extensive network of advocacy groups, nonprofits, PACs, affiliates, and community organizations backed by a handful of tech and real estate magnates, all with ties to at least one of the four groups at the center of what they’ve christened a Big Four “astroturf network”: TogetherSF, Grow SF, Neighbors for a Better San Francisco, and Abundance Network. These groups work toward a shared goal of transforming San Francisco into a city that more closely resembles a corporation than representative government, with the mayor as CEO and citizens as shareholders. In a statement to The New Republic, GrowSF said it was “pro-outcomes and anti-dysfunction, not anti-progressive,” and claimed that it works independently from other groups. Neighbors for a Better San Francisco executive director Jay Cheng stated that the group “focuses on backing organizations and candidates that share our priorities and vision.” “At first, when we were talking about it, it sounded very conspiratorial,” Phoenix Project executive director Jeremy Mack told me. “But then, as you start showing the money … it became a very clear line of: Oh, this is all coming from these like two dozen billionaires.” I wrote about those plutocrats in November for The New Republic: the interlocking donations, the massive amounts of dark money, and the donors with a history of supporting Republican candidates and causes. At least one of them supported Trump in past elections, but many more are Never-Trump Republicans—which may explain why they’ve successfully passed themselves off as moderates. If arch-neocon and warmonger Dick Cheney has a seat on Team Blue, why not William Oberndorf, the billionaire behind Neighbors for a Better San Francisco who also chairs Betsy DeVos’s school choice advocacy organization and donated $2.5 million to Mitch McConnell’s Senate Leadership Fund? Why not John Kilroy Jr., the real estate magnate who gave $1 million to Neighbors for a Better San Francisco (and also sat on the board of California’s largest Republican PAC), or William F. Duhamel, who donated to the National Republican Senatorial Committee in 2023? Real estate developers and organizations—not known for being particularly supportive of Democratic policies—also fund the “moderate” movement. The astroturf network is rabidly pro-YIMBY, and, at first glance, the movement seems like a no-brainer: San Francisco has a housing shortage, YIMBYs want to build housing—win/win, right? But these YIMBYs want the free market to determine where and how they build. In practice, that often means an increase mainly in luxury housing, which lowers rent very little for poor families. It also enriches real estate developers. “This is the most valuable real estate in the country,” Jaye said. “If you put a multiplier on it, you’re making hundreds of billions of dollars. So what’s a few million? The ultrawealthy pouring money into pet projects and buying politicians is hardly breaking news. But the network goes beyond specific policy. “They are putting the organizations in place to sustain power after an election and through multiple elections,” Stearns, the progressive consultant, told me. “I think that they are truly trying to create a moderate political machine that has a grassroots base.” After just four years of organizing, that machine is already large and complicated. I found at least 31 groups, past and present, with robust ties to the Big Four. Some existed for years or decades before the astroturf network popped up, but now receive significant funding from it and/or parrot its talking points. Other groups popped up, funneled money to a specific candidate or ballot initiative, then vanished. ConnectedSF, which received over $1 million from Neighbors for a Better San Francisco between 2021 and 2023, astroturfs neighborhood groups in all 11 city districts. It also participated in a bit of gerrymandering, according to Neighbors president Nick Podell; a note obtained by progressive outlet 48Hills.org brags that the group “[led] the Redistricting drive to capture moderate majorities in Supervisor Districts which will ensure moderate centrist candidates are elected in the future.” The network astroturfs good PR as well. In 2023, for example, the nonprofit Paint the Void commissioned local artists to create murals on boarded-up storefronts. Only after they accepted did some artists discover Paint the Void’s relationship with TogetherSF, which used the project to produce branded promotional materials—and that finishing the murals was optional. (Paint the Void says the affiliation was always public and confined to promotion.) One artist decided to finish her mural with enormous bubble writing: “Ethical Billionaires Don’t Exist.” TogetherSF and Grow SF deny overarching coordination based on a handful of endorsement variations between groups. These organizations aren’t all part of a lockstep top-down conspiracy, which is kind of the point. They’re a loose collection of local concerns that receive funding from a particular set of millionaires and billionaires with a long-term agenda, and who use them to advance goals from several angles. Broadly speaking, those goals include more government power and greater law enforcement; this network and its sponsors often support increased surveillance, decreased police oversight, and drug testing for welfare recipients. TogetherSF advocates holding at-large elections rather than allowing neighborhoods to pick their own representatives on the Board of Supervisors, a sentiment echoed by GrowSF co-founder Steven Buss Bacio on a podcast, along with a desire to merge San Francisco and the moderate areas that surrounded it to create “Bay City.” Despite employing strategic us-versus-them politics, the leaked TogetherSF document lists “political infighting” as a structural problem. Ideally, it states, “the Board of Supervisors would effectively check the power of the Executive, but would be ultimately aligned in values.” However, disagreement within a democracy is the system working as intended—and most of the people behind the Big Four aren’t politicians, officeholders, or community organizers. They are venture capitalists and founders immersed in startup culture that prizes efficiency above all else, and a wider conversation about governance in a world undergoing near-constant technological transformation. Misha Chellam, co-founder of the Abundance Network, thinks of himself as an “Abundance Progressive”—part of a movement that correctly identifies problems with gridlock and efficiency, then embraces its diametric opposite, a results-driven approach that does away with roadblocks like environmental impact review and court injunctions. It also seeks to eliminate the power of “narrow interests”: a broad category often illustrated with groups like teachers’ unions and police reform advocates. They hope to create an Abundance Faction within the Democratic Party. Others have more extreme ambitions. Garry Tan, the president and CEO of the venture capital firm Y Combinator and a GrowSF board member, describes himself on his X profile as an “e/acc,” or effective accelerationist—that is, a believer in an all-gas-no-brakes approach to technological progress that reads like Ayn Rand on (more) uppers in space. “We believe that there is no material problem—whether created by nature or by technology—that cannot be solved with more technology,” Marc Andreessen declares in his “Techno-Optimist Manifesto,” one of the most popular effective accelerationist texts. Limitless growth leads to limitless “abundance,” Andreessen writes, which will cause “all physical goods [to] become as cheap as pencils.” Economists tend to disagree, but no matter: Any attempts to question unlimited technological development are not just misguided, but morally repugnant. The manifesto fantasizes about “becoming technological supermen” and paraphrases Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, the Italian Futurist who co-wrote The Manifesto of the Italian Fasces of Combat, commonly known as the Fascist Manifesto, in 1919. Andreessen also cites Nick Land’s techno-capital machine as inspiration. Land is the father of traditional accelerationism, which holds that unlimited technological development will lead to social collapse, but that this collapse is necessary to create a better society. Land, along with fellow neo-reactionary Curtis Yarvin, envision “mini-countries, each governed by its own joint-stock corporation.” The idea resembles Balaji Srinivasan’s Network State concept, which Gil Duran has covered at length for The New Republic. Balaji, who goes by his first name, believes that crypto-fueled sovereign city-states run like corporations—with their own laws and a CEO calling the shots—can best facilitate abundance. Tech bros have attempted several such “startup societies,” but all are a long way out from sovereignty and self-sufficiency, which may explain why Balaji also fantasizes about taking over San Francisco. The plan: Create in-person meetups for the tech community (“grays”) that already exists online, then ally with law enforcement and the “reds” to physically expel the “blues” from the city. As explained by Duran, Garry Tan himself is a vocal supporter of the Network State movement. His taped speech at Balaji’s 2023 Network State Conference revealed an agenda that goes far beyond electoral politics. “Voting is important,” he said, “but on its own it just replaces the elected officials. We need to replace the unelected parts of the system as well. Building parallel education, nonprofits, media, unions; that’s what the Network State Conference is about.” In 2022, Tan described Y Combinator as “a prototype model for what [Balaji] talks about when he says the Network State.” And it’s definitely fostering a network of some sort: Affiliates include GrowSF co-founder Sachin Agarwal, Abundance network co-founder Zack Rosen, and TogetherSF backer Michael Moritz. Moritz is also a major investor in California Forever, a project that seeks to build a privately owned walkable city in nearby Solano County. According to a note obtained by The New York Times, Moritz pitched the project to a prospective investor as a way to experiment with new government structures. California Forever denies any association with the Network State movement, and yet a speaker at the aforementioned Network State Conference featured a conceptual drawing of California Forever in his slide deck, alongside the text, “I interviewed many startup city founders.” One month earlier, Duran points out, Balaji referenced California Forever on a podcast. “The Network State … is already being tried. You’re seeing it in Northern California, you know, this thing, this project. You’re seeing it with Creator Cabins and Culdesac and Praxis.” These latter three are network states; California Forever is the only project in Northern California that even approaches Balaji’s description. This tech-bro dark enlightenment fantasy has never had so many friends in high places. Donald Trump spoke about “freedom cities” during his campaign. JD Vance, a venture capitalist and former Peter Thiel employee, is a heartbeat away from the presidency; at time of publication, Elon Musk is still “First Buddy.” In September, Tan spoke at “Reboot,” an accelerationist conference with a sponsor list that included Uber, Yelp, and the Heritage Foundation. “After decades of pretending that Washington didn’t exist, Silicon Valley has woken up to politics, recognizes the stakes, and is playing to win,” the website declares. “We could be here for five hours talking about how broken this city is, but that’s why I think it’s so important for us to fight here,” Tan told his audience at a small e/acc event. “If we can build here, we’re going to take over the whole country. We’re going to take over every nation in the world.”  San Francisco’s local elections alone generated $72 million, much of it either directly from tech titans or funneled through the astroturf network. As it turns out, though, that money bought them very little. In the election’s most expensive Board of Supervisors race, Dean Preston narrowly lost to anti-progressive choice Bilal Mahmood, but the Democratic Socialists still have a seat on the board—Jackie Fielder won decisively in District 9. Ultimately, the anti-progressives managed to flip just two of the six supervisor seats. TogetherSF’s Prop D went down in ignominious defeat, as did Mark Farrell’s mayoral campaign; one day before the election, Farrell agreed to pay the largest ethics fine in city history after using money raised for Prop D by TogetherSF as a campaign slush fund. And in an ironic twist, Supervisor Joel Engardio—of school board-recall fame—is himself facing a potential recall over his support for Measure K, which creates a park and closes a roadway in his district, and which passed a citywide vote over the objections of his constituents. In the end, however, the millions bought enough. Moderates now hold a slim majority on the Board of Supervisors and, in the largely self-funded Lurie, the mayor’s office as well. (Lurie quickly added OpenAI’s Sam Altman to his transition team, despite the latter’s lack of political experience.) “The election results show that residents are shifting away from extreme progressivism,” TogetherSF Action CEO Kanishka Cheng told me via email; the group also rejects the “anti-progressive” label. And even if the TogetherSF brand fails to survive the Farrell scandal, it will likely reconstitute and recover before 2026. Its resources remain limitless; its ambitions vast. Toward the end of our walk, I asked Mark Dietrich about these groups. He’s been to some events and liked much of what they had to say. “I’m not a billionaire. They’re not billionaires,” he said of his fellow attendees. “These folks I’ve met are more like me. They live here. They have kids. And they see this dysfunction that I’ve described to you.” Most of the people who support San Francisco’s anti-progressive movement are more like Dietrich than Balaji. They’ve never heard of the Network State and don’t give a damn about e/acc. But they’re unhappy with how things are going, and they’re ready for a change. San Francisco is not a uniquely failed city. Some of its problems are worse than average, others far better, but they are largely the same ones facing every city in America. Our decades-long national war against economic progressivism has destroyed state mental health services, slashed social safety nets, implemented mass incarceration, lowered corporate taxes, and allowed our infrastructure to languish. Productivity has soared, while real wages remained virtually stagnant, which is why a handful with limitless millions can try to make their esoteric dreams of a neo-Spartan cryptostate a reality, while hundreds of thousands cannot afford basic food and shelter. Some progressives fight for structural improvements, yet far too many liberals cast themselves as defenders of the status quo, expending more energy assuring us that things are OK—and worse, take up counterproductive au courant causes like banning middle school algebra—rather than asking the hard questions that tech bros are answering so confidently, yet poorly. As long as the conditions that accompany widespread poverty endure, there will be an opening for a slick salesman with an anodyne name to take advantage of our misery to first divide us, and then rule.",0,[],2025-01-06 13:51:51,2025-01-06 20:20:24

The Stimson Timberland Legacy Project received this funding to preserve working forests across three counties: Pend Oreille, Stevens, and Spokane. This project comes at a perfect time, as rising property values and development pressures threaten the long-term survival of the local forest industry. The money flows from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service through its Forest Legacy Program, backed by the Inflation Reduction Act. This investment will keep these lands open for work and play, supporting local jobs in forestry while maintaining public access for outdoor activities. ""Washington's forests are irreplaceable treasures that provide far-reaching benefits to families, local economies, and visitors from all over,"" said Senator Patty Murray. The protected land will help reduce wildfire risks, store carbon, and create new opportunities for outdoor recreation. This project is part of a larger three-state effort to strengthen forest-based jobs and protect wildlife habitats. In 2024, the Forest Service has put nearly $420 million toward safeguarding over half a million acres nationwide by working with states, tribes, local communities, and private landowners. It put an additional $265 million to preserve a further 250,000 acres. The benefits reach far beyond the trees themselves. By keeping these forests intact, the project will boost the outdoor recreation economy, create new jobs, and make green spaces more accessible to nearby communities. For families living in eastern Washington, this means continued access to clean water, good jobs, and beautiful places to spend time outside. ""This funding will be put to great use on key forest conservation projects in Washington state and across the country and provide a boost to local communities who rely on our forests for clean water, jobs, and recreation opportunities,"" Murray added.

According to the Solar Market Insight Report by the Solar Energy Industries Association, commercial solar grew 44% in 2024 Q3 compared to the same time in 2023. Residential solar saw an increase of 39% year-over-year, and community solar increased 12% year-over-year. The report said, ""Texas and Florida continue to be the top-ranked states for capacity installed in 2024."" New commercial pipeline projects in California, Illinois, Maine, and New York were also highlighted. Solar installation continues to grow because of how much money it can save you. According to Forbes, ""Homeowners who invest in solar panels can save up to $187 monthly."" Additionally, the U.S. Department of Energy states that solar power is a vital tool in combating a warming planet. Since solar power doesn't produce toxic gases, using it instead of dirty energy reduces the amount of polluting gases emitted into the atmosphere. It also improves the air quality and reduces the water used in energy production. While investing in solar power to get these benefits may seem daunting, EnergySage makes it easy. The solar company has a marketplace where you can search for providers in your area just like you would search for flight deals. This tool ensures you find the best deal for your home. The Inflation Reduction Act can also help you save money installing solar panels. It offers tax rebates, which will make the upfront costs cheaper. EnergySage also has a tool to help you navigate just how much you can get in tax incentives. Unfortunately, the future of these tax breaks is unknown because, according to The Salt Lake Tribune, President-elect Donald Trump wants to eliminate them. However, it will take a vote from Congress to do so. While the future of these incentives is uncertain, the solar market is still thriving.

Unveiled at the Brussels Motor Show, this new model is the brand's second all-electric SUV, following the bZ4X, and serves as an unofficial successor to the gas-powered Urban Cruiser, which Toyota discontinued in 2014. As reported by Electrek, the Urban Cruiser EV brings a fresh take on Toyota's move into the electric market, combining modern design with new technology to attract consumers looking for more sustainable options. The Urban Cruiser features a sleek, bold design with a ""hammerhead"" front end and a full-length light strip across the rear. It's meant to stand out on the road, with a look Toyota calls ""urban tech,"" designed to give the vehicle a commanding presence from all angles. While Toyota hasn't released details on its range yet, the Urban Cruiser is expected to offer up to 250 miles with the larger battery option. Pricing is expected to start around $44,500 (£35,000), with the SUV launching in the United Kingdom by the third quarter of 2025 before expanding into other European markets. This is part of Toyota's strategy to offer a broad range of electrified vehicles. By 2026, the company plans to have 15 zero-emission models in its lineup, including six battery-electric vehicles built on dedicated platforms. The goal is to achieve a 100% carbon dioxide reduction by 2035, contributing to Toyota's effort for carbon neutrality by 2040. However, not everyone is convinced. One Electrek commenter raised concerns about the pricing strategy, saying: ""Why, oh why do companies such as Toyota price their vehicles just (or, appreciably) above Tesla's Model 3 & Y? They are slowing down EV adoption, most notably of their own brand."" Others echoed sentiments about the vehicle's performance, with one stating: ""Underpowered from both the motors and battery. Sub-par range. Overpriced. Not looking good for a product that is months away. Toyota appears to have a problem sizing the EV market."" Someone else noted: ""This represents progress over the BZ4X, I guess. A vehicle this small isn't absolutely out of the question in the North American market."" While Toyota's approach may not win over every critic, there are undeniable benefits to making the switch to an electric vehicle. EVs typically come with lower maintenance costs; fuel savings; and a quieter, smoother driving experience. Plus, they produce no tailpipe pollution, helping to reduce pollution. And while concerns over battery manufacturing and mining practices are valid, it's important to keep in mind that even with these challenges, EVs still offer much cleaner alternatives to traditional gas-powered cars. Each EV on the road is a step toward a future with less pollution — and with each new model, including the Urban Cruiser EV, we're getting closer to that goal.

According to the study, published in Nature.com journal Scientific Reports, the hydrocoral forest was discovered at depths ranging between 1.23 and 33 meters (4 to 108 feet) below the ocean's surface in Chile's marine-protected Kawésqar National Reserve. Typically found in much deeper and colder waters, hydrocorals play a crucial role in marine ecosystems by providing shelter and habitat for various species. In dense clusters, corals create marine animal forests, unique ecosystems of significant ecological importance that cover only 0.1% of the world's ocean floors. ""The structural complexity generated by [marine animal forests] on the seabed is used by numerous species to settle and live, hide, feed or reproduce, so they are also true hotspots of biodiversity,"" said Ana De la Torriente, a researcher at the Spanish Institute of Oceanography, per Rewilding Chile. The presence of red hydrocorals is also a sign of a healthy ecosystem. ""They are bioindicators. Because they're species that can't move, they're super sensitive to any changes in the environmental conditions,"" marine biologist and director of the Austral University of Chile's coastal laboratory Ignacio Garrido said, per Mongabay. The shallow location of this forest makes it easier to study and monitor compared to its deep-sea counterparts. This accessibility may help uncover strategies for conserving similar ecosystems, which are increasingly under threat from warming temperatures, invasive species, pollution, and other stressors. Additionally, the proximity to the surface provides an opportunity for greater public awareness and engagement with ocean conservation efforts. The discovery of this unique hydrocoral forest is not just a win for scientists — it's also a step forward for communities that depend on healthy marine ecosystems. Protecting habitats like these can bolster fisheries, enhance coastal resilience, and support the broader health of our oceans. Similar conservation success stories, such as the revival of coral reefs in Northern Ireland, Spain, and Mexico, highlight the potential for reversing environmental damage and safeguarding biodiversity. Innovative technologies, such as robotics and automation, are helping restore coral reefs worldwide. These advancements, alongside discoveries like those in Chile's Kawésqar National Reserve, are crucial for preserving vital marine ecosystems. As Ingrid Espinoza, Conservation Director of Rewilding Chile, told the Rewilding Institute, ""The results of this study clearly demonstrate the presence of unique and singular ecosystems in the area. We need to implement management plans and strict protections to ensure their long-term survival.""

Here's what you need to know.,"Lakshmi Varanasi,Jacob Shamsian",2025-01-06T10:41:01.000Z,"Elon Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI will likely play out in 2025. Musk says OpenAI has lost sight of its mission to develop AI safety, prioritizing profits instead. Here's what you need to know about a battle that could impact the future of artificial intelligence. Two of the most powerful forces in the AI industry are set to collide this year: xAI's Elon Musk and OpenAI's Sam Altman. Musk was one of 11 cofounders, including Altman and President Greg Brockman, who established OpenAI as a nonprofit in 2015 with the mission to ""advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return."" Musk left in 2018 — a year before OpenAI added a for-profit arm — citing a conflict of interest with his work at Tesla, though his lawyers say that he contributed to the company until mid-2020. Since then, he's become a vocal skeptic of OpenAI's commitment to prioritizing transparency and safety over profit. The feud between the founders escalated in August when Musk filed a lawsuit against Altman, OpenAI, and Microsoft, the company's biggest investor. Musk accused them of deception, prioritizing profits despite its stated mission. That lawsuit will likely play out this year — a major battle that could impact the future of artificial intelligence. Here's what to expect. Musk first filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in a California state court in February 2024, accusing OpenAI of violating its nonprofit mission by partnering with Microsoft. Musk withdrew that suit in June. He filed a new lawsuit in August 2024, this time in a federal court, accusing OpenAI of a bait-and-switch deception that violates RICO laws — anti-racketeering laws first designed to target organized crime families. Musk's lawyers say in the lawsuit that Musk ""lent his name to the venture, invested significant time and millions of dollars in seed capital, and recruited top AI scientists for the company,"" all with the understanding that OpenAI would remain a nonprofit and prioritize developing the technology safely. Musk's lawyers say OpenAI ""betrayed"" its mission when it added a for-profit arm in 2019 and deepened its partnership with Microsoft in 2023. ""Musk and the nonprofit's namesake objective were betrayed by Altman and his accomplices,"" the lawsuit reads. ""The perfidy and deceit are of Shakespearean proportions."" In mid-November, Musk's lawyers expanded their complaint to include accusations that OpenAI and Microsoft violated antitrust laws by asking the company's investors not to back competitors in the generative AI space, like Musk's own xAI, which he launched in 2023. In his latest move, Musk — also in November — asked a federal judge to stop OpenAI from converting into a fully for-profit corporate entity. OpenAI has denied the claims. A representative for the company directed Business Insider to a post it published on December 13 responding to Musk's allegations. ""Now that OpenAI is the leading AI research lab and Elon runs a competing AI company, he's asking the court to stop us from effectively pursuing our mission,"" OpenAI wrote. ""You can't sue your way to AGI. We have great respect for Elon's accomplishments and gratitude for his early contributions to OpenAI, but he should be competing in the marketplace rather than the courtroom."" Resolving the lawsuit could take months or even years. US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, who is overseeing the case in the San Francisco federal court, hasn't yet set a trial date. Rogers will begin hearing arguments on January 14 on whether she should issue the preliminary injunction to prevent OpenAI from converting into a nonprofit until the rest of the case is resolved. In weighing whether to issue the injunction, Rogers is supposed to consider the ""likelihood of success"" that Musk will win the case. Her decision would strongly indicate how the rest of the case might play out. In a blog entry posted to its website on December 27, OpenAI explained why it needed to evolve its corporate structure. The company said it wants to transition its for-profit arm into a Delaware Public Benefit Corporation⁠ — which, unlike a traditional company, prioritizes social good alongside profit — to prepare for a more capital-intensive future. OpenAI said the structural change would enable it to ""raise the necessary capital"" to pursue its mission of developing artificial general intelligence and to give it more leeway to consider the interests of its backers. The company said it would still run a nonprofit on the side focused more narrowly on charitable initiatives in healthcare, education, and science. Rose Chan Loui, a nonprofit legal expert at UCLA, said OpenAI's current nonprofit status grants it significant control over technological development. ""What we lose in this conversion is a nonprofit with the unique ability to control AI development activities — to be a watchdog from the inside, making sure that AI is being developed safely and for the benefit of humanity. From that perspective, it seems to me that the nonprofit's current control position is priceless,"" she wrote to Business Insider in an email. If the conversion to a for-profit public benefit corporation goes through, OpenAI would need to ensure that the nonprofit retains assets worth as much as what it's giving up, including a significant premium for its control. That could be in the form of cash or stock that it can sell for cash. Still, ""what seems to be envisioned is a grant-making foundation that can do good but will have a very reduced, if any, impact on the development of AI,"" Chan Loui said. Former employees have also raised concerns that the nonprofit would have a reduced role in public safety. Miles Brundage, OpenAI's former head of AGI Readiness, who left in October, responded to OpenAI's December post, saying on X that ""a well-capitalized nonprofit on the side is no substitute for PBC product decisions (e.g. on pricing + safety mitigations) being aligned to the original nonprofit's mission."" He added that much of OpenAI's rationale for conversion makes sense. However, there are still ""red flags,"" including a lack of details about its new governance structure and guardrails around the technology. Other individuals and organizations have filed amicus briefs to the federal court where Musk filed his suit. These briefs are meant to inform the court and help it make a decision. Kathleen Jennings, the attorney general for Delaware, where OpenAI is incorporated, filed one last week. She detailed her role in protecting the public interest if OpenAI becomes a for-profit public benefit corporation. Chan Loui said Jennings's brief is a hopeful sign that, no matter what happens, public interest will ultimately win. ""It is encouraging that the Delaware AG has stated her commitment to protecting the public interest, including seeking an injunction if she determines that the conversion is inconsistent with OpenAI's mission and its obligations to the public, that OpenAI's board members are not fulfilling their fiduciary duties, or if the value of the conversion or the process for arriving at it is not 'entirely fair.'""

Get smart, tough, and send the Bill to my desk to sign as soon as possible,” he wrote in a Sunday evening post on his Truth Social network. “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Trump has made promises to enact a merciless immigration crackdown that could see millions deported, to cancel green energy projects to make way for more oil and gas drilling, and to extend tax cuts passed during his first term that disproportionately benefit the rich. He reasserted his claim that he will finance these plans with tariffs on imports of foreign goods, which experts say could make inflation worse for American consumers. “Members of Congress are getting to work on one powerful Bill that will bring our Country back, and make it greater than ever before,” Trump wrote. “We must Secure our Border, Unleash American Energy, and Renew the Trump Tax Cuts, which were the largest in History, but we will make it even better-NO TAX ON TIPS,” he added, hinting at the sweeping agenda he expects congressional Republicans to quickly enact, including a promise to remove income tax on service workers’ tips. “IT WILL ALL BE MADE UP WITH TARIFFS, AND MUCH MORE, FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE U.S. FOR YEARS,” Trump wrote. House Leader Mike Johnson (R-LA) told Fox News earlier Sunday that, despite having a razor-thin majority in the lower chamber, he plans to pass the sweeping legislation in the House by early April and get it to Trump’s desk by Memorial Day. While Johnson has made peace with what he called Trump’s idea of a “big, beautiful bill,” other Republicans on Capitol Hill have expressed reservations about the one-bill approach. The right-wing House Freedom Caucus made its opposition to one big policy bill known last month in a letter to Johnson demanding one bill to deal with border security and a “larger reconciliation bill covering taxes, spending, energy, bureaucracy, and more.” In the House, where the GOP has the slimmest majority in nearly a century, it would only take one or two Republicans to break rank to jeopardise a piece of legislation’s prospects. In fact, it required Trump’s personal intervention last week to get Johnson reelected speaker after Reps. Ralph Norman (R-SC) and Keith Self (R-TX) initially opposed. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) seemed to express reservations on Sunday about Trump’s ambition, namely his ability to enact his hardline immigration agenda. “Is it realistic to deport everybody?” he asked during an appearance on Meet the Press, “I mean, there’s a lot of people in this country who are here illegally.” Thune’s remarks appeared to suggest a belief the incoming administration may want to consider adopting a more incremental approach to its core policy.",2.9k,[],2025-01-06 13:52:55,2025-01-06 19:53:40

As Mongabay reported, researchers netted pods of dolphins in Florida and Louisiana to check their vitals and collect samples, including exhalations from their blowholes. Scientists found that all the dolphins breathed out microplastic fibers, similar to those shed from synthetic clothes. In other studies, these same fibers have been found deep in the lungs of humans. Microplastics are everywhere, in our food, water, and even the air we breathe. When these tiny bits of plastic debris enter the lungs, they can damage tissue and impact our immune systems. Leslie B. Hart, one of the study's authors, explained to Mongabay, ""Plastic pollution has been found on every continent and in every ocean, in people, terrestrial wildlife and marine wildlife."" These plastic products break down into tiny fragments that enter our waterways, where they're often mistaken as food by everything from zooplankton to whales, and eventually work their way back up through the entire food chain to humans. Fibers, like those found in the dolphins, are the most commonly observed microplastic type, accounting for 71% of the total number of microplastic particles found in a study of river water. ""We're really just starting to skim the surface,"" Hart told Mongabay, in finding evidence and learning about the long-term impacts of microplastic exposure. Studies have already shown microplastics can delay development and reproduction in animals, and microplastics' even smaller byproduct, nanoplastics, can enter and damage human cells. While it would be impossible to completely remove microplastics from the environment, researchers are exploring ways to mitigate and reverse their toxic effects. Probiotic supplements have been shown to help reduce inflammation caused by microplastics in the gastrointestinal system. Scientists have also developed water filtration material composed of readily available materials like sawdust that's effective at removing microplastics from drinking water. Monitoring for microplastics can be expensive, but scientists recently created a cost-effective wireless portable microplastic detection device that, when paired with a smartphone or mobile device, can count the number of particles present in a water sample. Accessible innovations like these can help protect not only our health, but the health of our marine friends. The best way for individuals to make a positive impact is to use less plastic in our daily lives and thus opt for biodegradable or reusable alternatives — instead of one-time-use petroleum-based plastics that will inevitably degrade into additional microplastic waste that ends up in the environment, wildlife, and our bodies.

With nearly 750,000 residents affected, the city's new plan focuses on restoring ecosystems and using tools like water tariffs and conservation incentives to get the job done. According to Conservation International, the Green Climate Fund-backed plan will restore 15,000 hectares of land using those tools and public funds. ""We are profoundly thankful to the Green Climate Fund for recognizing and prioritizing this critical initiative,"" Bogotá Mayor Carlos Fernando Galán said. ""Additionally, Bogotá will also introduce a new component in the water tariff to finance environmental investments in these watersheds,"" Galán continued. The program offers new income opportunities through Payment for Ecosystem Services for farmers and rural communities. For families in urban areas, it means a more reliable water supply and a safeguard against extreme weather events such as flooding. And for Bogotá itself, it's a long-term investment in keeping its high-altitude ecosystems healthy. Bogotá plans to invest 1% of its unrestricted budget in conservation efforts, supported by the water tariff to ensure long-term funding. Backed by $11 million from Colombia's Ministry of Environment, this project is shifting the focus from short-term fixes to lasting solutions that prioritize sustainability and real impacts. ""The Bogotá water project concept is a pioneering approach to addressing urban water security in the face of climate change,"" said Henry Gonzalez, chief investment officer of the Green Climate Fund. What makes this project special is its focus on nature-based solutions. Bogotá confronts climate challenges by restoring wetlands, forests, and other key ecosystems. This turns them into natural long-term defenses against droughts and floods while also saving money for cities and individuals. This focus on nature-based solutions reflects a broader shift happening worldwide. In the U.S., programs like the Inflation Reduction Act are supporting clean energy upgrades, helping homeowners cut costs while making infrastructure more sustainable. ""This project embodies the kind of innovative, nature-based solutions we need to meet our global climate and sustainable development goals,"" Gonzalez said. Bogotá's initiative is tackling some big challenges, putting both people and the environment first.

In an interview with the BBC, primatologist Dr. Jane Goodall stressed the urgency of protecting the environment and wildlife. Dr. Goodall said, ""We're in the midst of the sixth great extinction."" She added, ""We don't have much time left to start helping the environment. We've done so much to destroy it."" However, she hasn't lost all hope. ""We still have a window of time to start slowing down climate change and the loss of biodiversity. But it's a window that's closing."" Dr. Goodall noted that destroying wild places is linked to the warming planet because trees are vital for absorbing polluting gases. When she studied chimpanzees more than 60 years ago, the two wet seasons happened like clockwork. Now, it can rain in the dry season and be dry in the rainy season, which makes it difficult for chimpanzees, birds, and insects. Dr. Goodall said it's vital to ""impose tough regulations on what people are able to do to the environment,"" ""rapidly move away from fossil fuel,"" and stop industrial farming. She said if these things don't happen, ""The future is ultimately doomed."" According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, scientists say a warming planet is the ""biggest global health threat of the 21st century."" Many places are experiencing extreme heat that never did before, meaning people don't have solutions such as AC to handle it, and it doesn't even cool down at night. This causes heat-related illnesses, such as heat exhaustion, heatstroke, and cardiovascular and kidney diseases. There are hundreds of cases of extreme heat every year in the U.S., and they are killing more people on average than other deadly weather events, like hurricanes. The warmer weather is also causing storms to be worse and more frequent. Wetter areas are becoming wetter, and drier places are drier. The NRDC also noted the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that 2021 saw 20 climate-based disasters in the United States that resulted in at least $1 billion in costs. The total cost to communities across the year was $145 billion, which also doesn't include health damages. Dr. Goodall says one remedy is habitat restoration, such as tree planting.

Their findings appear in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. The discovery centers on a special type of semiconductor called 2D halide perovskites. These materials switch between different colors at specific temperatures, opening possibilities for smart windows and building coatings that automatically adjust to help keep indoor spaces comfortable. The research team at Nanyang Technological University made this breakthrough by adding non-toxic dimethyl carbonate into perovskite crystals. This combination created four new types of semiconductors with unique properties. One of the most exciting findings was that one material could switch between orange and red colors when heated to about 176 degrees Fahrenheit, then return to orange when cooled down. The team showed this color change could happen repeatedly; at least 25 times in their tests. These smart materials could be used in building coatings that automatically respond to temperature changes. For example, windows or walls could become more reflective on hot days, helping keep buildings naturally cool without using extra air conditioning. This would reduce both energy bills and air pollution from power plants. The materials could also improve solar panels and LED lights, making clean energy technology more efficient and affordable for homes and businesses. The technology builds on years of research into perovskite semiconductors, which scientists have studied intensely because they're cheaper and easier to make than traditional semiconductors. This latest advance makes them even more practical by adding the ability to respond to temperature changes. These new materials will need more testing before they appear in consumer products. However, the research team has already proved the basic concept works. Going forward, they'll attempt to make the materials more durable and test them in real-world conditions.

The gateway drug theory and many other ideas about drug use have been put into question in recent years as more resources are dedicated to understanding substance use, which has been highly stigmatized for decades. After initially labeling cannabis as a gateway drug in 2010, President Joe Biden even later walked back his stance, saying in 2019: “I don’t think it is a gateway drug. There’s no evidence I’ve seen to suggest that.” The roots of substance use disorder are complex and not fully understood, but one of the hallmarks of addiction is understood to be caused by repeated drug use that neurologically changes the brain. Because the use of one substance like alcohol or nicotine is associated with the use of other drugs like cannabis, many have drawn causal links between the use of various drugs in theories like the gateway drug hypothesis. However, this idea has been highly debated, and as the understanding of substance use has improved, scientists began to understand that people may have a “common liability” to substances in general and that drug use is influenced by a host of factors. A new study published late December analyzed brain scans of adolescents before and after they first tried alcohol, nicotine or cannabis, shedding light on one factor that could be influencing whether people decide to start using drugs. Writing in JAMA Network Open, Dr. Alex Miller, the study’s lead author and an assistant professor of psychiatry at Indiana University School of Medicine, and his team found that adolescents who initiated substance use had differences in certain brain structures compared to kids who didn’t use drugs. Importantly, most differences existed before they started using alcohol, nicotine or cannabis. “The study sort of helps us highlight which regions may be important to further explore, with respect to their association as pre-existing risk factors for substance use initiation,” Miller told Salon in a phone interview. Structural brain differences have been previously found in people who use drugs and were assumed to be effects of drug use, said Dr. Jonathan Foulds, a professor of public health sciences at Penn State College of Medicine who was not involved in the study. This study shows certain differences were there among adolescents who used substances prior to use, meaning they could not have been caused by the substance use, he said. Want more health and science stories in your inbox? Subscribe to Salon's weekly newsletter Lab Notes. “Our behavior is determined basically by our brain and our experience, and our experience can affect our brain as well,” Foulds told Salon in a phone interview. This study ""casts doubt on some of the prior gateway theories because it seems like many of the same brain differences that are a risk factor for nicotine use are also a risk factor for alcohol and cannabis use.” The differences observed in the study were small but statistically significant within a large sample size close to 10,000 participants, Miller said. Specifically, those who initiated these substances before age 15 had larger overall brains and a thinner prefrontal cortex in certain regions compared to kids who didn’t initiate drug use. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for things like decision making and information processing, and some research has found that a thinner prefrontal cortex is associated with more impulsive behavior and risky decision making, which could be linked to kids initiating substance use, Miller said. On the other hand, some of the measures observed in this study went in the opposite direction to what is observed in brain scans of people who have substance use disorder. For example, heavy drug use has been linked to smaller overall brain sizes, and heavy cannabis consumption has been linked to smaller hippocampal volumes. In this study, substance use was linked to larger overall brain sizes and larger hippocampal volumes. Importantly, this doesn’t mean that children with these differences in anatomy will inevitably go on to try drugs, said Dr. Bertha Madras, a psychobiology professor at Harvard Medical School, who was not involved with the study either. There are dozens of risk factors that influence whether kids use drugs, including genetics, accessibility to substances, and the prenatal environment. It may be that some other factor is influencing the anatomical differences and drug use, like a predisposition to risky behaviors or teens’ perception of how harmful substance use is, Madras. “Integrating the whole picture would give us a much better view of what the risk factors for using drugs are and what the risk factors that are consequent to drug use are,” Madras told Salon in a phone interview. This analysis uses data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study, which was designed to follow a large group of children over many years to help determine the neurological origins and consequences of substance use. Miller said he plans to use the data to try and tease out what is behind these brain differences and whether they are due to genetics or potential environmental risk factors. In October, another study using the ABCD dataset found that certain brain activity in childhood could predict substance use initiation and that this was associated with children’s exposure to pollution. “Understanding the complex interplay between the factors that contribute and that protect against drug use is crucial for informing effective prevention interventions and providing support for those who may be most vulnerable,” said Dr. Nora Volkow, the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse in a press release.",1,[],2025-01-06 13:52:55,2025-01-06 20:22:18

The sheer number of tires — a couple of thousand, Salt Lake County health officials estimated — is the result of a concerning illegal dumping problem that has been going on in the area for some time, according to KSL News, which called the latest act ""incomprehensible."" Dumped at the site along with the tires were two boats and a refrigerator. ""It's really sad,"" Hayley Shaffer of the Salt Lake County Health Department told KSL News. ""It's heartbreaking that people don't care about the environment."" Sadly, illegal dumping in the United States is quite common, with 1.5 million tons of trash being dumped each year — or about 4,109 tons of trash every day. According to one study cited by the Environmental Protection Agency, old tires are among the most frequently dumped items, followed by refrigerators and other heavy objects. Dumped tires, especially in large quantities, are extremely harmful to the environment as well as the plants and animals that call it home. Tires are manufactured with a chemical cocktail of carcinogens, radioactive compounds, and microplastics, so as they break down in whatever environment they are dumped in, those chemicals leach into soil and local waterways. Dumped trash can also become a breeding ground for mosquitoes and rats. In fact, dumpsites with tires create ideal conditions for mosquito reproduction, with mosquitoes multiplying at a jaw-dropping rate of 100 times faster than normal, according to the EPA. More mosquitoes and rats increases the likelihood that humans will contract severe illnesses, such as dengue fever, hantavirus, and even the plague. As authorities searched for the perpetrators, a cleanup of the dumping ground was anticipated, but not without a price. The last cleanup of the area cost $20,000. However, this time authorities expected it to cost more. ""If the people who dumped here just did their due diligence and cared about the environment, they would take it to the landfill,"" Shaffer told KSL News. Frustrations about the illegal dumping are compounded by the fact that a city landfill is just a short walk from the dumping site. ""We have dumps for a reason,"" one person wrote in the comments of KSL News' coverage. ""There is no excuse for this behavior,"" another person said. ""I'd be willing to help clean those up,"" someone else wrote. ""So sad that people are so careless about their own environment.""

OpenAI would have fallen apart back in 2023 without venture capitalist Ron Conway and Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky, Sam Altman wrote in a blog post on Sunday. Altman expressed his gratitude to Conway and Chesky in a blog post titled ""Reflections,"" which detailed his brief ouster from OpenAI. Altman said the post was inspired by a recent interview he gave to Bloomberg, which was published on Sunday as well. ""Ron Conway and Brian Chesky went so far above and beyond the call of duty that I'm not even sure how to describe it,"" Altman wrote. Altman was fired as OpenAI's CEO on November 17, 2023. The company's board said in a statement that it was removing Altman because he ""was not consistently candid in his communications with the board"" but did not elaborate further. Altman returned as CEO on November 22, 2023, after nearly all of OpenAI's staff threatened to quit if he wasn't reinstated. In his blog post, Altman said ""there were a lot of people who did incredible and gigantic amounts of work"" to help him and OpenAI when he was ousted, but Conway and Chesky ""stood out from all others."" ""I've of course heard stories about Ron's ability and tenaciousness for years and I've spent a lot of time with Brian over the past couple of years getting a huge amount of help and advice,"" Altman wrote. ""But there's nothing quite like being in the foxhole with people to see what they can really do,"" he continued. ""I am reasonably confident OpenAI would have fallen apart without their help; they worked around the clock for days until things were done."" Conway and Chesky, Altman wrote, gave him ""great advice"" and ""stopped me from making several mistakes."" The pair also tapped on their vast networks to assist him, Altman added. ""I thought I knew what it looked like to support a founder and a company, and in some small sense I did,"" Altman wrote. ""But I have never before seen, or even heard of, anything like what these guys did, and now I get more fully why they have the legendary status they do."" Representatives for Conway and Chesky did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment. Conway and Chesky are longtime friends of Altman and were one of the first people he called after OpenAI fired him. Conway was also one of Altman's guest speakers when the latter taught a class on startups at Stanford University in 2014. Altman and Chesky's friendship, meanwhile, goes back more than a decade. Altman mentored Chesky when Airbnb was a part of Y Combinator, a startup accelerator. When Altman was fired from OpenAI, he briefly considered launching another AI startup but was discouraged by Conway and Chesky, The New York Times reported in December 2023. ""You should be willing to fight back at least a little more,"" Chesky told Altman, per The Times. OpenAI's board, Conway later told Time magazine, had fired Altman for ""nitpicky, unfireable, not even close to fireable offenses."" The billionaire venture capitalist had spoken to the magazine as part of a profile on Altman that was published in December 2023. ""It is reckless and irresponsible for a board to fire a founder over emotional reasons,"" Conway told the outlet.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/finance/news/worked-boeing-over-30-years-102644793.html,I worked at Boeing for over 30 years. I witnessed the fallout of outsourcing firsthand.,,Business,Business Insider,6 min read,Douglas Dorsey worked on the shop floor at Boeing as an engineer for over 30 years. He said problems began in the late 1990s during a merger.,Charissa Cheong,2025-01-06T10:26:44.000Z,"Manufacturing engineer Douglas Dorsey started working at Boeing in 1984 and retired in 2017. Dorsey worked on the Boeing 777 and 787 Dreamliner, where he said things began to unravel. He reflects on his time on the shop floor and how Boeing plans to repair its reputation. This as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with Douglas Dorsey, from Washington, about his career as a manufacturing engineer at Boeing. The following has been edited for length and clarity. I started my career at Boeing in 1984, and I worked there for over 30 years. I was a manufacturing engineer. My responsibilities included writing instructions and coming up with assembly sequences for aircraft. During my career, I worked on several aircraft projects for Boeing, including the Advanced Tactical Fighter program, the Boeing 777, and the 787 Dreamliner. It was always interesting and challenging. I worked with dedicated employees and on cutting-edge programs. I retired in 2017 feeling proud to have worked there. I was a ""lifer"" with Boeing blue blood running through my veins. However, while working on the Boeing 787 program in the 2000s, I noticed that outsourcing manufacturing tasks to suppliers became a really big problem for Boeing. When I worked on the shop floor, I saw the negative impacts of outsourcing to suppliers, such as slower production and delivering incomplete parts. Even after retiring, I've stayed up to date with Boeing. I've followed the news on malfunctions and strikes, but I think management is taking baby steps in the right direction. During the good old days, I had a positive opinion of Boeing. In my first decade at the company, the chain of command was clear. You knew what your job responsibilities were and could count on your line managers. Most importantly, there was no drama with executives, and we had confidence in those in command. But in 1997, upper management was thrown into chaos when Boeing merged with McDonnell Douglas, with McDonnell Douglas executives taking top positions at Boeing. Harry Stonecipher, who was briefly Boeing's CEO, resigned in 2005 after he was found having an affair with an employee. It was like a corporate soap opera played out in the media. As an employee, the news was distracting and felt like evidence of the level of disorder at the top of the company. At the same time, the Boeing 787 program was underway. The 787 was launched as a complete departure from how Boeing airplanes had traditionally been constructed. To reduce the time from program launch to when the planes were in service, Boeing would have ""risk-sharing partners"" deliver complete aircraft sections to the final assembly site. 787 program managers and employees implicitly understood this new production method, and we cautiously believed it might work. But it began to unravel bit by bit and ended in a three-year delay. I was a project manufacturing engineer for the 787, creating work instructions, and a liaison manufacturing engineer, working on the shop floor to resolve issues with existing work instructions. At the beginning of each new airplane program, program leadership and supply chain management divided major sections of the aircraft among various subcontractors, suppliers, and risk-sharing ""partners."" When suppliers were late in delivering their components or delivered them incomplete, this became ""traveled work,"" which had to be completed by Boeing employees during final assembly. I spent much of my time on the program trying to accommodate parts that had a ""non-conformance"" tag on them and had to be reworked and installed into the build. I wondered what was going on and why we were accepting substandard, incomplete work. As an engineer, I wasn't privy to the decisions going on in the upper chambers of management, but I could see the chaos filtering down. It felt like the company wasn't listening to its mechanics about how to improve processes. I remember group meetings where employees, including myself, questioned decisions by management and offered constructive criticism that was politely but bluntly blown off. The 787 was sadly delayed three years. In 2024, there was an incident with a Boeing 737 Max plane, where a door plug blew out after take off. Although I retired in 2017, I think this was caused by mismanagement of traveled repair work. The plug door was manufactured by Spirit AeroSystems, a Boeing subsidiary that was sold off in 2005. An investigation found that because the part 737MAX9 fuselage is shipped in whole, mechanics at Boeing rarely work on the plug doors. When the plug door frame had to be repaired and the plug door replaced, two separate groups of mechanics working on the door made mistakes. As a result, a plug door malfunctioned, and Boeing's reputation was damaged alongside it, causing the FAA to increase its oversight of 737MAX9 planes' production processes. It's always disappointing when the company you worked for makes major news headlines for a mistake. However, it doesn't change my general opinion of Boeing. I know there are many dedicated employees who are committed to doing their jobs properly and safely. I still know some Boeing employees and followed the recent strike. I think employees have gotten a good package, but they didn't get a return to the legacy defined-benefit pension plan. When I retired, I still benefited from the traditional pension plan and also had a 401(k). Back in 2014, Boeing promised employees that they'd build the 777-9 in Washington. Part of the strike package is also building the next new plane in Washington. These promises show that Boeing management is waking up to the matter of outsourcing. Boeing is also bringing Spirit AeroSystems, which it sold in 2005, back in-house. All the workers will be merged back under one camp. The lines of communication between two in-house teams are often simpler and more direct than with a supplier. When I was on the 777 program in the 1990s, I would call my counterparts at the Wichita site to resolve issues and exchange information. I couldn't do this with a supplier because all communication had to be through supply chain management. I think this shows Boeing acknowledging it went down a bad path when it sold the supplier. I see these actions as baby steps in the right direction. Kelly Ortberg, Boeing's CEO, is trying to steer the company on a new course, but I think it's going to take a long time. Editor's note: In response to Business a request for comment from Business Insider, a Boeing spokesperson highlighted remarks by CEO Kelly Ortberg during the company's third quarter report: ""Much has been written about how we got to where we are, but most also recognize that Boeing was once a benchmark for what good culture looks like. And I believe we can return to that legacy. I know culture change starts at the top. Our leaders, from me on down, need to be closely integrated with our business and the people who are doing the design and production of our products. We need to be on the factory floors, in the back shops, and in our engineering labs. We need to know what's going on, not only with our products but with our people.""

In a classically forthright Truth Social post Trump, 78, said Bragg “never wanted to bring this lawless case against me.” “He was furious at the way it was handled, and especially angry at MARK POMERANTZ for his behavior, and what he did,” Trump added, referring to Bragg’s alleged feelings towards the former Manhattan District Attorney’s Office prosecutor who worked on an investigation into Trump’s sketchy payments to porn actress Stormy Daniels during his first stint in the White House in 2016. Mark Pomerantz previously argued that his team built a “solid case” for securing Trump’s conviction on financial crimes way back in 2022. He said the then green Bragg stalled on the case because he was unfamiliar with the details, meaning no conviction was sought. This led to Pomerantz resigning. Trump’s Sunday evening tale of woe continued, in third person no less: “Ultimately, the Biden/Harris DOJ forced Bragg to concoct anything to embarrass TRUMP. But it was even more so what the CORRUPT and TOTALLY CONFLICTED POLITICAL HACK Judge did, and is doing, on this sham trial.” He then claimed he is legally not allowed to speak about the judge’s “conflicts of interest,” even after calling Merchan a “TOTALLY CONFLICTED POLITICAL HACK” in the previous sentence. “I even have, STILL, an Unconstitutional Gag Order where I am not allowed to speak about the Judge’s highly disqualifying Conflicts of Interest. Virtually ever legal scholar and pundit says THERE IS NO (ZERO!) CASE AGAINST ME,” he lamented. “The Judge fabricated the facts, and the law, no different than the other New York Judicial and Prosecutorial Witch Hunts,” Trump added. Concluding seamlessly with claims that “IT’S ALL RIGGED,” he signed off with: “That’s why businesses are fleeing New York, taking with them millions of jobs, and BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TAXES. The legal system is broken, and businesses can’t take a chance in getting caught up in this quicksand. IT’S ALL RIGGED, in this case against a political opponent, ME!!!” Judge Merchan had rejected a request from the President-elect for the case to be dismissed so as to accommodate his presidency after his sweeping election victory. After that decision, Trump called the judge a “radical partisan” on Truth Social. He argued that presidential immunity means the case should have been thrown out. This comes even after Merchan indicated that Trump wouldn’t be jailed. Trump, who would still be the first president to take office convicted of felony crimes, looks set to receive a conditional discharge—where a case gets dismissed if a defendant avoids rearrest. Trump was convicted in May of 34 counts of falsifying business records as part of an alleged scheme to hide a hush money payment to porn actress Stormy Daniels.",462,[],2025-01-06 13:52:55,2025-01-06 21:45:18

Prisha Mosley, 26, began transitioning to a male at 17 years old while struggling with mental illness, including anorexia, suicidal thoughts and trauma from being raped. Transgender activists online convinced her that she was unhappy because her ""body was fighting to be a boy,"" which led her to share these thoughts with the medical professionals treating her eating disorder. ""I had been treated for delusional beliefs for quite a while,"" Mosley explained to Fox News Digital. ""But when I expressed a different delusion, that was, 'I'm born in the wrong body,' instead of, 'I'm fat,' when I was dying of anorexia… I was medicalized for that."" Mosley said she was almost immediately put on medication to stop her menstrual cycle, before later being given testosterone. Within ""days"" she experienced changes to her genitals and other ""disturbing"" side effects. ‘Losing Their Health’: Detransitioner Sounds Alarm About Sex-change Surgeries Negatively Impacting Children ""I was 17. I had never even been able to legally consent to sex as an adult. I knew nothing about my body except that I was scared of it. And then I was given the means to change it and told that this change would make me safe,"" Mosley said. Read On The Fox News App She claimed medical professionals misled her and her reluctant parents about the risks involved and pushed them into believing that changing her gender would solve her mental distress. But it didn't. Instead, she was left with lifelong health problems and chronic pain from the drastic effects of the testosterone and having a double mastectomy. ""There was nothing wrong with my body that had to be treated with medicine. I was experiencing mental distress and then based on the belief that this distress was somehow related to the essence of my gender and that essence or soul being trapped in the wrong body? It's quackery."" ""I didn't have some magical gender essence that was trapped inside my girl body that I needed to be medicalized for. That's pseudoscience,"" she continued. Detransitioned Teen Wants To Hold ‘Gender-affirming’ Surgeons Accountable: ‘What Happened To Me Is Horrible’ Mosley said her medical team even used her previous suicide attempts as proof that she should've transitioned genders sooner. ""As soon as a patient says that they're trans, no matter what was happening prior or what is going on, ethics goes out of the window. There's no longer a need for evidence-based care,"" she argued. ""There's no standard of care. It's a one-size fits all, shoehorning you down a pipeline to blockers, hormones, surgery. As soon as a person says, 'I'm trans' or, ‘I have gender dysphoria,’ doctors start experimenting on them and lie to them and don't hold themselves to medical standards anymore,"" she said. ""All the doctor has to do is trick you into thinking that you're happy with whatever they decide to do to you. And if you are tricked enough that you don't kill yourself, which I was, I was hopeful that I was going to magically be transformed into a safe boy, I stayed alive for that. As long as you are in this tricked, deluded state, you're considered a success,"" she continued. Mosley said she realized a few years later she had made a ""terrible mistake."" She stopped taking the drugs before eventually detransitioning to live as a female again. Mosley recently gave birth to a baby boy and resides in Michigan. Although she suffers from chronic nerve pain, the mother of two says she tries to be strong and not show it in front of her children. Mosley has shared her story as an ambassador for Independent Women's Forum and is taking legal action against the medical professionals she says pushed her into gender transition. Despite facing backlash from transgender activists within her community, Mosley continues to warn others about the risks involved with these treatments. ""I regret trusting people who were making money off of my distress and my vulnerability,"" Mosley said in a message to other young people considering going down the same path. ""I hope you will be wiser than I was. There are people in your life who don't benefit from your distress and from your pain,"" she said. More detransitioners are speaking out about the negative consequences they've faced from transgender treatments, which include puberty blockers, hormone therapy and sex reassignment surgery, as states move to ban these treatments for minors. The U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments last month challenging a Tennessee law banning transgender medical treatments for children in December.

U.S. Navy veteran Zachary Young alleges that CNN smeared him by implying he illegally profited when helping people flee Afghanistan on the ""black market"" during the Biden administration's military withdrawal from the country in 2021. Young believes CNN ""destroyed his reputation and business"" by branding him an illegal profiteer"" who exploited ""desperate Afghans"" during a November 11, 2021, segment that first aired on CNN’s ""The Lead with Jake Tapper."" 14th Judicial Circuit Court Judge William S. Henry, who will preside over the trial in Bay County, Florida, has ruled that Young ""did not act illegally or criminally"" despite what the network reported on air. Judge Declares Navy Veteran Suing Cnn For Defamation 'Did Not Act Criminally Or Illegally' CNN’s legal team had argued that Young’s actions violated the Taliban’s Sharia law, but Judge Henry slapped down the notion he violated the law as part of a series of pre-trial losses for CNN. As a result, the jury will be instructed to assume Young did nothing against the law. Judge Henry has also declared the court found Young ""did not take money from Afghans."" Jury selection is set to begin on Monday and Young is expected to be the first witness called. Read On The Fox News App A lot has changed at CNN since the segment at the center of the trial first aired in November 2021. Former CEO Jeff Zucker, who ran the network at the time, is long gone. His successor, Chris Licht, exited the network after a brief one-year tenure. Former parent company WarnerMedia merged with Discovery to create Warner Bros. Discovery, and Mark Thompson now serves as chairman and CEO of CNN Worldwide. The network has seen significant turnover along the way, with high-profile hosts like Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo out the door. Two things that remain the same are CNN host Jake Tapper and correspondent Alex Marquardt, who both are still with the network more than three years after airing the report on Young. Veteran Suing Cnn Scores Another Victory, Judge Rules Expert Witness Can’t Claim Segment Didn’t Impact Income Tapper first teased the 2021 segment at the center of the suit by warning CNN viewers of ""desperate Afghans still trying to escape the country being preyed on by folks demanding that they pay up big time to get out."" Later in the show, Tapper reminded viewers that the story on ""desperate Afghans"" being ""preyed upon"" was up next. Once the much-hyped segment began, Tapper said Marquardt found ""Afghans trying to get out of the country face a black market full of promises, demands of exorbitant fees, and no guarantee of safety or success."" Tapper tossed to Marquardt, who said ""desperate Afghans are being exploited"" and need to pay ""exorbitant, often impossible amounts"" to flee the country. Marquardt then singled out Young, putting a picture of his face on the screen and saying his company was asking for $75,000 to transport a vehicle of passengers to Pakistan or $14,500 per person to end up in the United Arab Emirates. ""Prices well beyond the reach of most Afghans,"" Marquardt told viewers. CNN then aired Marquardt allegedly attempting to call Young, who did not answer the phone. ""In a text message, he told CNN that Afghans trying to leave are expected to have sponsors pay for them,"" Marquardt said, adding that Young told the network evacuation costs are ""highly volatile and based on environmental realities."" Marquardt then said Young ""repeatedly declined to break down the cost or say if he’s making money,"" before playing a clip of an anonymous sympathetic man who couldn’t afford to have his family evacuated from Afghanistan. Marquardt went back to Young, saying he received another text message. ""In another message, that person offering those evacuations, Zachary Young, he wrote, ‘Availability is extremely limited, and demand is high’… he goes on to say, ‘That’s how economics works, unfortunately,’"" Marquardt told viewers. Tapper responded, ""Unfortunately, hmm,"" before thanking Marquardt for the report. No other people or companies were named other than Young. The segment was shared on social media and also repackaged for CNN's website. The Marquardt report was re-aired Nov. 13 on Jim Acosta’s CNN show. ""Nearly three months after the fall of Afghanistan, many Afghans are still desperate to leave. CNN’s Alex Marquardt found a black market ready to take advantage,"" Acosta told viewers. Young’s legal team believes that CNN using the terms ""black market,"" ""exploit"" and ""exorbitant"" inaccurately painted him as a bad actor preying on desperate people. CNN issued an on-air apology on March 25, 2022, when substitute anchor Pamela Brown was sitting in Tapper’s chair. ""In November, we ran a story about Afghans desperate to flee the country who faced paying high sums beyond the reach of average Afghans. The story included a lead-in and banner throughout the story that referenced a ‘black market.’ The use of the term ‘black market’ in the story was an error. The story included reporting on Zachary Young,"" Brown told viewers. ""We did not intend to suggest that Mr. Young participated in the black market,"" she continued. ""We regret the error, and to Mr. Young we apologize."" Judge Henry ruled in December that the remarks were insufficient, as Florida law states retractions of defamatory material must attempt to mirror how the content was originally distributed. ""This retraction, correction was not made during the other television shows in which the segment aired… no retraction, correction or any apology was posted on any online article or with any social media posting,"" Judge Henry said during a pre-trial hearing. Internal communications between CNN employees that were revealed during the discovery process have indicated editors were concerned about the initial segment but aired it anyway. Other internal communications revealed CNN employees used profanities and disparaging language when privately discussing Young. ""Marquardt referred to him as 'f---ing Young' and quipped, 'it’s your funeral, bucko,'"" according to a court document. Jurors will also hear that one CNN employee told colleagues that Young has a ""punchable face."" Cnn Faces Defamation Suit Over Afghanistan Withdrawal Story: 'Evidence Of Actual Malice' Warner Bros. Discovery was ordered to hand over a bevy of CNN’s financial information in order to determine appropriate punitive damages if Young is victorious. CNN remains confident that it will prevail. ""When all the facts come to light, we are confident we will have a verdict in our favor,"" a CNN spokesperson told Fox News Digital. Media Research Center associate editor Nicholas Fondacaro, who has been glued to pre-trial hearings while covering the lawsuit, believes the defamation case is critical because it exposes how CNN approaches stories. ""The case is about CNN’s wanton use of incendiary language that’s meant to evoke emotion over rationality. If it can seep into an organization's culture, it can raise wider questions and concerns about their newsgathering,"" Fondacaro told Fox News Digital. ""CNN fames itself as a preeminent truth teller, but here we saw them toss around terms like ‘black market’ and, when pressed, they insisted they meant ‘grey market.’ Journalists should be using precise and accurate language when presenting information in order to prevent inaccurate interpretation by the public,"" Fondacaro continued. ""Instead, we got a report suffused with and driven by reporters’ personal animosity toward their subject."" Cnn Turns Over Internal Documents As Part Of High-stakes Defamation Suit Fondacaro said the case allows the public to ""peek behind the veil and see how CNN journalists communicate among themselves"" when discussing their subjects. Young’s lead counsel, Vel Freedman, said his client is looking forward to the trial. ""Mr. Young has waited over three years for justice, he is very much looking forward to his day in court,"" Freedman told Fox News Digital. Once jury selection concludes, the trial will be streamed live.

While most cases have been mild, commonly characterized by conjunctivitis and respiratory symptoms, this previously healthy Canadian teen was hospitalized from the virus in critical condition. Their symptoms started with double conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye, and turned into a fever and coughing. A few days later the teenager was admitted to intensive care after developing acute respiratory distress syndrome. “This was a healthy teenager prior to this, so no underlying conditions,” said British Columbia’s health officer, Bonnie Henry, at a news conference at the time. “It just reminds us that in young people this is a virus that can progress and cause quite severe illness.” Now, a recent report brings to light more details about the teenager’s case. In the report, published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), researchers explain that the 13-year-old girl spent weeks fighting for her life after contracting a severe H5N1 infection from an unknown source. In finding her diagnosis, researchers say that she initially tested positive for influenza A, but not the seasonal subtype. Further testing suggested she had a high viral load of a novel influenza A infection, which researchers discovered to be the H5N1 avian flu. The next day doctors started her on oseltamivir, also known under the brand name Tamiflu. However, her respiratory functions declined rapidly causing her to be intubated. She was also placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a machine that is a form of life support for people with life-threatening illnesses. In addition to the ECMO machine, the teenager received a plasma exchange and two more antiviral medication treatments — amantadine and baloxavir. In an accompanying editorial, experts noted while mutations were detected in her case, it’s “unclear whether these mutations were present in the infecting virus or emerged during the course of the patient’s illness.” In other words, it’s unclear if the virus mutated to be more severe in humans. “The mutations evident in the Canadian case highlight the urgent need for vigilant surveillance of emerging mutations and assessment of the threat of human-to-human transmission,” the editorial stated, adding that vaccine development and therapeutics are also needed — perhaps to treat more severe illness. “The Canadian case showed higher viral loads in the lower airway and very prolonged shedding, despite therapy, which highlights the potential need for longer therapy.” Researchers concluded their editorial with an acknowledgment that “many questions remain.” For example, the severity of cases is likely to depend on host immunity, the route of exposure, or other changes in the virus. Currently, the CDC says that the risk to most Americans remains low. “We do have candidate vaccines and antivirals available to try to mitigate severe influenza in the case of wider spread,” the report stated. “That said, a balance between enhanced vigilance and ‘business as usual’ is needed.”",0,[],2025-01-06 13:52:55,2025-01-06 21:46:57

Likins, a backup singer who toured with Fleetwood Mac and Linda Ronstadt, fell victim to a Nigerian online romance scammer and was conned out of more than $1 million in cash and crypto funds. Over the course of two years, Likins became involved with a ""very complicated scam"" by a man who claimed to be an Australian gold miner and who wooed her over the Internet with stolen photos of a German life coach. Stevie Nicks Tells Katy Perry To ‘Get Off The Internet’ ""I had nothing left. I sold my house,"" Likins exclusively told Fox News Digital. ""This scammer wanted me to sell my car, but fortunately that was when I saw the ‘Social Catfish’ show, so I didn't sell my car. ""I wanted to kill myself at first, because my husband left me in very good shape, and after two years with this scammer, I didn't have anything left but my car and my clothes and I just wanted to end my life. I didn't know what I was going to do."" Read On The Fox News App Likins added, ""I didn't have money for food. I didn't have money to pay my utilities. My electricity was turned off twice. I lost 40 pounds. I got Covid. I didn't have money for a doctor. I mean, I was really, really in deep trouble."" Her problem with the scammer began immediately after one small change to her social media account. Manti Te'o Cracks Joke About Infamous Catfishing Incident ""When my husband passed away, on my Facebook profile, I put in there that … I was now a widow. Big mistake,"" Likins said. ""That's like putting a sign on yourself that says scam bait. That's how it all started."" Likins recalled the scammer being a ""perfect gentleman"" in their initial online conversations, and said that despite her not being interested in anything romantic just yet, he would write to her ""every day for six months."" ""One day he sent me pictures, and each picture had a complicated, convoluted story that went with it,"" she remembered. ""All the photos were stolen off of the German life coach public site on Facebook. One day, he sent me a picture of him, supposedly, next to a statue of Buddha, and that did it when I got that picture. I thought, ‘OK, this person might be all right.'"" Like What You’re Reading?

She was told that her online suitor was the director of a gold mine, and he was currently in the Australian outback with a team of 20 men on his last job before retirement. He was running out of time on the expedition, and was already $8,000 in the hole. To make matters worse, if they wanted to communicate, she'd have to send him $1,000 and cryptocurrency so he could purchase the proper Wi-Fi to use his phone so they could stay in contact while he was working in Australia. Likins claimed they spoke via Facetime through a ""very sophisticated"" method using audio equipment matched with video components. When the video elements ""stalled,"" the scammer would say, ""I can't hear you anymore, Let's go back to texting."" Each request for money became more complicated and convoluted, but Likins was still hooked by the scammer, who showed off 24-karat gold bars and asked for her home address so he could securely send a safe packed with bundled $100 bills to her home.

""The scammer said if I would upgrade the logistics company shipping, I would have it in three days. So I did. That was the first really large sum of money."" Nothing was ever delivered to her home. ""I went to the airport four different times to pick this person up, because he would send me pictures of his name on a boarding pass arriving at a certain day and time,"" Likins said. ""I would go to the airport, and of course … that flight did not exist, and neither did he."" The scam was over by accident when Likins tuned into a television show called ""Social Catfish."" She ""went into shock"" within minutes of the program after watching a story similar to her own play out on TV, and wrote to the producers asking to get in touch. Through research, ""Social Catfish"" (a company which verifies online identities through AI reverse search technology) discovered the scammer's real identity. Despite losing everything, Likins found strength in an unlikely person and got in contact with the real person in the photographs she had been sent by the scammer. ""As it turns out, the reason there was a picture of him with Buddha is because he is a German spiritual and business life coach,"" Likins said. ""He's like Germany's version of Tony Robbins."" She added, ""He started doing everything he could do to advise me on how to heal myself and reminding me to love myself and to forgive myself and to keep living.

Here’s how to stay motivated if your work isn't recognised",,Business,Yahoo Life UK,6 min read,"During her Golden Globes acceptance speech, Demi Moore revealed she was once referred to as a ""popcorn actress"". So, how do we stay motivated in our careers?",Emma Clarke·Contributor,2025-01-06T12:40:21.000Z,"As ever, last night’s Golden Globes was filled to the brim with headline-worthy moments – but none more so than Demi Moore’s speech, as she accepted the award for Best Actress for her role in The Substance. Despite being in the movie business for 45 years, it was the first major accolade she has won. Taking stock of her career to date, the Ghost star not only spoke of the honour of the award, but also reflected on how she had been told by a producer that she is a ""popcorn actress"" – someone who stars in big movies and is a household name, but ""couldn’t be acknowledged"" in a critical sense. She wrapped her speech up by saying that when the script of The Substance – a 2024 thriller about a woman who loses her job on her 50th birthday and is offered a substance promising to enhance her life – came across her desk, she realised that she was ""not done"" with her acting career. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Golden Globes (@goldenglobes) Beyond Hollywood, though, this is a sentiment that many people can relate to. Pursuing your dream job can often seem like a thankless task – and it can also be difficult to remain focused, passionate and driven when you face multiple setbacks. According to career coach Ayesha Murray, the main reason for this is that it takes time to build our personal brand. ""Recognition comes as a result of proven and consistent experience in our field, through building a positive reputation and through contributions within our organisation and within the wider industry,"" she says. ""However, that doesn’t mean our achievements can’t be recognised early on in our careers – after all, these are the building blocks for long-term success."" Kevin Fitzgerald, UK MD at Employment Hero, meanwhile, suggests ""there is undoubtedly a gendered element to this as well."" ""All too often women are not given the same recognition as men for their early career work, as they are generally less likely to shout about their achievements than men, for fear of being seen as a ‘show-off’,"" he says. ""All workplace leaders can do more to make sure women are recognised for this work."" Having self-belief is key to staying motivated and reduces the reliance on external validation, according to Murray. So if you feel that you’re not being supported through your organisation, then setting personal growth goals (learning new skills, expanding your network) will maintain your sense of achievement and confidence. She also recommends breaking down larger goals into smaller, more manageable tasks that you can get done in a shorter time frame. ""Remember to celebrate each small success along the way. This will maintain your momentum and give you a sense of progress,"" she adds. ""Try and see the value in the work you’re doing, rather than fixating on needing recognition,"" Murray says. ""Maintaining a positive mindset towards your work will give you a sense of purpose and builds long term confidence and fulfilment."" Surrounding yourself with people who encourage you – whether that be colleagues, mentors, or friends – can also help, according to Murray. ""Set up regular check-ins, attend networking events or join professional bodies,"" she says. ""Taking agency over our career success requires regular reflection and adjustments to the plan when necessary,"" Murray outlines. ""Set aside time to review what you’ve learned, your achievements, and the obstacles you’ve overcome. Take pride in your journey."" Actively seeking opportunities puts you in control of your career, she adds. ""Showcase your work, be strategic when it comes to building your network and don’t be afraid to speak up about your contributions."" Fitzgerald explains that the decision to change careers isn't about a specific timeline – it's about honest self-reflection. ""If you're no longer growing, can't see opportunities for meaningful impact, or find your values misaligned with your work, it's time to consider a change,"" he states. ""Our recent employee wellbeing survey showed that 65% of UK workers have experienced burnout – which is often a sign that a change is needed."" ""It's never too late to pursue what drives you, but don't discount the valuable skills and experience you've gained in your current role,"" Fitzgerald says. ""The modern workplace offers unprecedented flexibility to blend traditional careers with passion projects."" ""Start small – perhaps with a side project or part-time study – while maintaining stability. The best path often combines security with pursuing your passions, rather than choosing between them,"" he adds. Murray also says that there is always time to explore alternatives and reshape your career path. ""I don’t believe we should ever give up on anything. It’s just sometimes the timing needs to be right,"" she says. And if you are having doubts? ""Revisit your dream job,"" she advises. ""What was it that attracted you to it? What would life look like if you were doing that now? Which parts of the job would you love right now, and which parts wouldn’t quite work? ""Could you experiment with a portfolio career – maintain your current career while testing out the dream job on the side? ""If changing career seems too drastic, then look at elements of your dream job that could be incorporated into your current path. You may need to find another role or industry that wouldn’t require a complete change,"" she concludes.

""I bought in, and I believed that, and that corroded me over time, to the point where I thought a few years ago that maybe this was it, maybe I was complete. I’ve done what I was supposed to do."" Elsewhere, it was Emilia Pérez and The Brutalist that were the big Golden Globes winners in the film categories, leaving with four and three awards respectively. The Brutalist won Best Picture (Drama) and Best Director — as well as Best Actor in a Drama for Adrien Brody, cementing itself as the frontrunner for Best Picture at the Oscars. The mammoth three-and-a-half-hour movie follows Brody as a Jewish architect trying to achieve the American Dream after fleeing Hungary during the Holocaust.

It's a bizarre story about a transgender crime boss who enlists a lawyer to help her transition into a new life as a woman. The other acting categories saw Kieran Culkin continue his march to the Best Supporting Actor prize at the Oscars for A Real Pain, as well as Sebastian Stan securing Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy for his transformative work in A Different Man. Brazilian star Fernanda Torres scored a big upset in the Best Actress in a Drama category, winning for I'm Still Here ahead of the likes of Nicole Kidman and Angelina Jolie.

Accepting the prize, director Jon M Chu said: ""In a time where pessimism and cynicism rule the planet, that we can still make art that is a radical act of optimism that is empowerment and that is joy … this means so much to all of us."" Wicked also found itself as the butt of numerous jokes from Globes host Nikki Glaser — whose opening monologue was well-received — including several nods to the infamous ""holding space"" interview with stars Erivo and Ariana Grande. Over in the TV categories, the acclaimed historical drama Shōgun topped the charts with four awards, while Netflix's Baby Reindeer and Max comedy Hacks got two wins each. Despite securing the most nominations, Hulu's The Bear only managed a single victory, for leading man Jeremy Allen White.

""I think right now, when the world’s in the state that it’s in, and people are really struggling, we need stories that speak to the complicated and difficult nature of our times,"" said the Scottish comedian. He added: ""So commissioners, streamers, when you’re totting up the numbers and putting together the budgets for this year, remember to keep some back for the little person to tell their story.""

If the Globes are any sort of indicator, it'll be a straight fight between The Brutalist and Emilia Pérez for the top prize — though Demi Moore could continue her march to glory as well. Too much to hope for The Substance as probably the goriest Best Picture winner ever? Probably.

Chicago rallied in the game's final minute at Lambeau Field with a walk-off field goal for a 24-22 win to snap a 10-game losing streak in its final game of the season as Green Bay locked into the No. 7 seed in the playoffs. The Packers finished the game without quarterback Jordan Love and wide receiver Christian Watson, both of whom were injured in the first half. Love appeared to escape a significant injury ahead of next Sunday's wild-card playoff round against the Philadelphia Eagles. Chicago took an early 14-3 lead and had a chance to run out the clock with a 21-19 edge late in the fourth quarter. But DJ Moore fumbled on a screen pass with 1:52 remaining, and the Packers recovered. Green Bay then drove to set up Brandon McManus for a go-ahead field-goal attempt with 54 seconds remaining. McManus' line drive from 55 yards just made it over the crossbar to give Green Bay a 22-21 lead.

They drove 47 yards on their ensuing possession and set up Cairo Santos for a game-winning field goal as time expired. Santos' 51-yard kick cleared the crossbar just inside the left upright to secure the Chicago win. The Bears snapped a 10-game losing streak with the win over their division rival to end the season 5-12. The Packers lock into the No. 7 seed in the NFC playoffs at 11-6 and will travel to face the Eagles next Sunday. The Washington Commanders earned the No. 6 seed with the Packers' defeat and their win over the Dallas Cowboys. Love suffered an elbow injury in the first half and was replaced by backup Malik Willis. Love remained on the sideline for Green Bay's next possession, and the Packers listed him as questionable to return. WillIs remained in the game as a Packers rally from a 14-3 deficit fell short. Love warmed up and threw the ball on the sideline in the second half, but never re-entered the game. Watson left with a non-contact knee injury in the first half. He was carted off the field and ruled out of the game at halftime. The Packers entered Sunday having already clinched a playoff berth. But they played their starters as they had a chance to improve their seeding before Washington's win ensured that they would not move up to the No. 6 seed. After the game, head coach Matt LaFleur told reporters that Love could have returned, but was held out as a precaution. Love told reporters that he lost feeling in his throwing hand and didn't feel 100% at game's end. He said ""yes"" when asked if he feels good about his playing status next week against the Eagles. The outlook on Watson's health was less promising. “I’m not sure confident about that right now,” LaFleur said of Watson's status. Love suffered his injury on a first-and-10 play as the Packers trailed, 14-3 in the second quarter. He faced pressure in the pocket and dumped the ball off to running back Josh Jacobs as he got hit. Love stood up after the hit shaking and flexing his right hand. He pointed to his hand, and athletic trainers took to the field to inspect the injury.

Trainers continued to evaluate Love on the sideline before the Packers announced that he had sustained an elbow injury. Love did not return to the field as Willis continued to lead Green Bay's offense through the end of the game. Watson suffered his injury prior to Love's. He fell to the turf untouched while running a route and immediately grabbed his right knee in pain. PRAYERS UP: #Packers receiver Christian Watson just suffered a non-contact injury.

Williams,2025-01-06T13:30:19.000Z,"Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts. Given the exponential market run-ups in artificial intelligence stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA), the space is sure to be on many investors' minds right now — but the seasoned tech players know that too much hype can sometimes spell disaster. “I think the AI wave is coming,” Yahoo co-founder and AME Cloud Ventures founding partner Jerry Yang said to Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on the 100th episode of the Opening Bid podcast (see video above; listen below). “Maybe it’s upon us, depending on who you talk to.” This embedded content is not available in your region. “We’ve seen a few waves of technology, and with each one of these waves, [we] go through this hype cycle,” Yang said. “And then you cross the chasm and then you come to the other side.” Yang, 56, has spent his entire career betting on (and mostly winning at) technology. He was a doctoral student at Stanford when he co-founded “Jerry's Guide to the World Wide Web” with his friend and classmate David Filo in 1994. Their pet project served as a website directory that gained steam and attention immediately. The name was initially changed to ""Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web."" After receiving a million hits by the end of 1994, the duo made another name switch. Yahoo (an acronym for Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle) was incorporated and launched in 1995. Explosive growth fueled by the rocket-ship-like adoption of the internet led them to take the company public in 1996. A meeting with Alibaba (BABA) founder Jack Ma in 1997 would ultimately benefit Yang and the company when Yahoo purchased a 40% stake in Alibaba for $1 billion in 2005, an investment it would later sell for $7.6 billion in 2012. Yang served as CEO of Yahoo from 2007 to 2009 and left the company in 2012. Yahoo has been owned by private equity firm Apollo Global Management (APO) since Sept. 2021. Today, Yang is an early-stage investor at AME Cloud Ventures — making bold bets on technology like quantum computing with Rigetti Computing (RGTI) — and spends the other part of his time as a Silicon Valley statesman handing out guidance to aspiring visionaries. One advantage newer companies in the AI domain have over their more senior tech predecessors is the benefit of hindsight. “When we were building the company and the internet was being built, there was no playbook,” Yang said. “It was literally the Wild West and you were trying to figure out what [everything] looked like.” Read more: Why Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is so bullish on AI agents By 2000, Yahoo was “one of the more valuable companies for no apparent reason other than the stock market driving it up,” Yang explained. “And then the bubble busted, and then it took a few years before all the valuations and the users and the infrastructure really caught up to the hype.” AI could be on a similar pathway given the demand and market enthusiasm demonstrated in 2024, when Nvidia became the most valuable public company in the world. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, currently boasts a heady valuation of $157 billion, with users turning to the service en masse — but no profits to speak of yet. Fellow tech veteran Tom Siebel, founder and CEO of C3.ai (AI), said on Opening Bid that generative AI was “getting pretty frothy,” noting that it provided “important technology services [and] solves some very real problems.”  However, OpenAI “could be gone next Monday,” he cautioned, adding that leaders at these companies “think they’re building God in a box.” Bullishness in general on the AI space could bear out. “If you go now to certain parts of [San Francisco], it’s AI central,” Yang said. “The amount of talent [and] people that are starting to put not only capital but resources and energy into AI is astounding.” “I think it’s going to be part bubble,” he continued. “But the reality also is going to be really incredible.” Three times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

There are, as expected, a number of snubs and surprises. Emilia Pérez leads nominations for film with 10, while The Bear leads the TV pack with five. Yahoo Entertainment is guiding you through what films and television shows people were shocked to see make the list ahead of tonight's ceremony. After earning praise for her work in two movies, The Outrun and Blitz, Ronan wasn’t nominated for anything. She has been nominated for four Golden Globes in the past and won once for her lead role in the comedy Lady Bird. Though Zendaya earned a nod for her lead role in Challengers, neither of the film’s leading men (or the two other points of its love triangle) picked up nods. O'Connor won a Globe in the past for playing Prince Charles in The Crown. The Outer Banks cast member was expected to break out with his supporting role in Queer — and he did! — but he didn’t receive a nomination. Sing Sing received a few nominations, but nothing for the formerly incarcerated actor who stood out in the film for playing a younger version of himself. This was his first major acting role. Though she has already racked up a number of nominations for her lead role in Hard Truths, a Golden Globe nod wasn’t one of them. It’s one of the most baffling snubs this year. Deadwyler has received heaps of praise for her supporting role in The Piano Lesson but no Golden Globe nomination. Though Dune: Part Two received a nomination for Best Motion Picture — Drama, its director wasn’t nominated. He was nominated for his directing of the first Dune film in 2022. The leading man for this year’s runaway box office hit Deadpool & Wolverine didn’t get any nominations, though the Golden Globes is one of the awards shows most likely to honor comedic performances and superhero films. Though Wicked earned quite a few nods, Bailey didn’t pick up any for his supporting role, surprising many. The Best Director field was clearly crowded this year, and some Wicked fans are shocked its director didn’t earn a nod despite its powerhouse performances and complicated dance numbers. After it won a major award at the Cannes Film Festival and generated unexpected box office success, it might not be entirely surprising that The Substance is getting awards attention — but the sheer number of nominations was impressive, including Margaret Qualley’s nod for her supporting role and Coralie Fargeat’s nominations for both directing and writing in crowded fields. Kinds of Kindness had an unusual triptych structure, but Plemmons’s performance as three different characters clearly stood out to Golden Globes voters. Powell had a massive year. It’s a surprise to see his craft nominated, not because it didn’t earn praise — it did! — but because his charm out-of-character generated more buzz than his acting work. Still, he earned an unexpected nomination in the Best Performance by a Male Actor in a Motion Picture — Musical or Comedy category for his role in Hit Man. Though Grant’s acting prowess is well known, his role in Heretic earned a Golden Globes nomination, shocking even him. “I feel like a gate crasher. But a very warmly received one. Massive thanks to the Golden Globes and to Scott Beck and Bryan Woods for spotting my need to kill, and to A24 for sponsoring it,” he said in a statement. After he was reportedly snubbed for a spot in Variety’s Actors on Actors series, Stan earned a rare double nomination in both Best Actor categories for A Different Man (a comedy) and The Apprentice (a drama). Though performances in Marvel properties are often overlooked at awards shows, Hahn snagged a Best Actress nomination in the TV category for her lead role in the series Agatha All Along. Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story generated plenty of conversation and controversy — and now it has officially yielded a first-time Golden Globe nomination for Koch. It’s a huge year for Gomez, who captivated audiences with her supporting role in the musical Emilia Pérez and with her lead role in the comedy series Only Murders in the Building. Both nods weren’t necessarily unexpected, given the praise she has received for those separate projects over the past year, but scoring both is particularly impressive. Winslet is another double nominee for her work in film and TV. She earned a nod for playing the title character in the drama Lee and the lead in the limited series The Regime. There has been a lot of anticipation for the film September 5, but not many people have seen it. It hasn’t played at many festivals and isn’t even being shown in select theaters until Dec. 13. This one’s shocking because so few people knew what to expect. The second season of the popular series is expected to be impressive because of its reputation alone, so the shock here comes from the fact the general public won’t even be able to see it until Dec. 26.

Pederson had a Super Bowl win with the Philadelphia Eagles, but did have a sour finish there. The Jaguars had an exciting young quarterback in Trevor Lawrence and needed a professional at head coach after the Urban Meyer debacle. It turned out to be a bad relationship all around. Pederson, who fired his defensive coordinator after a massive collapse last season, had to be the one to pay the price for the Jaguars' awful season this time around. The Jaguars fired Pederson on Monday after finishing 4-13 this season. One of those defeats included a horrific 52-6 loss to the Detroit Lions that dropped Jacksonville to 2-9. It was the worst loss in Jaguars history. Pederson managed to hang on for the rest of the season, but he's now done in Jacksonville after three years. While many wondered if Jacksonville would make it a clean sweep and fire general manager Trent Baalke as well, team owner Shad Khan said in a statement that Baalke will remain in his role. That was surprising news considering the Jaguars' record in Baalke's four seasons is just 25-43 and deficiencies in the roster was a reason for their 4-13 record this season. Statement from #Jaguars owner Shad Khan, who says GM Trent Baalke is staying. https://t.co/wpdlKuiqa0 pic.twitter.com/snjZterahk — Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) January 6, 2025 The Jaguars improved in the first season after Meyer — it was almost impossible to be worse — but it slowly got worse for Pederson after that. The Jaguars started this season with a winless September that included choking away a lead against the Miami Dolphins, being blasted on Monday night by the Buffalo Bills and losing another game in the final minute against the Houston Texans. The Jaguars barely won a home game against a shorthanded Indianapolis Colts team, but then went to London and looked listless in a loss to the Chicago Bears. Jacksonville dropped games to the Eagles, Pederson's former team, and the Vikings after that. The Jaguars weren't happy to see such a poor start shortly after Lawrence signed a five-year, $275 million contract. Pederson was in trouble from very early in the season. Pederson looked like he'd be a top NFL coach for many years after the Eagles won the Super Bowl. He outcoached Bill Belichick in that Super Bowl. That was at the end of his second season as an NFL head coach. It went downhill fast. He went 40-41-1 over the next five seasons, never winning more than nine games in any season. He was fired by the Eagles after the offense and specifically Carson Wentz regressed and there were questions about his choices at assistant coach. The Jaguars saw his championship pedigree and gave him a shot, and in his first season the Jaguars made the playoffs and had a historic comeback win over the Los Angeles Chargers in the wild-card round. That was the peak in Duval County. In 2023, the Jaguars were 8-3 to start the season but lost five of their final six games and missed the playoffs. Lawrence's ankle injury, which he played through but hindered his performance, was a factor. Pederson fired defensive coordinator Mike Caldwell after the season but kept offensive coordinator Press Taylor, and the latter decision was questioned. It set up a season in which Pederson had to produce better results, and the Jaguars got off to a horrendous start. The Jaguars job will be attractive to anyone who thinks Lawrence can still be a franchise quarterback. Plus, the new head coach will walk in with the Jaguars owning the 5th pick in the 2025 NFL Draft. Lawrence has played at a high level but consistency has been an issue. He played in 10 games this season due to injuries, the fewest single-season starts in his four-year career. Those injuries included a concussion and a sprained AC joint. He's not going anywhere, considering his contract and lofty pedigree as a top prospect coming out of Clemson. The new head coach will succeed if he can get Lawrence playing at a higher level and keep him on that level consistently. Upgrading the cast around Lawrence will be a priority too. Even though Pederson had an offensive background, given how important Lawrence reaching his ceiling is for the franchise, it seems like the Jaguars will focus on another offensive-minded head coach in their interviews. There hasn't been a lot for the Jaguars to get excited about. Lawrence was supposed to be a franchise savior but that hasn't happened. Pederson was going to elevate Lawrence but it's hard to say that happened either. A rough start to Pederson's third season ensured he wouldn't get a fourth.",64,[],2025-01-06 13:54:58,2025-01-09 00:31:23

The poor timing of the sport's calendar means that players need to enter the transfer portal immediately after the end of the season to enroll at a new school for the second semester. That means players across the country have to leave their current teams before a bowl game to find a new school. And that coaches have to both prepare their current players for a bowl game while also recruiting transfers for the 2025 season. Here's our tracker of notable QB transfers across college football ahead of the 2025 season. Former five-star recruit Malachi Nelson is heading to UTEP. Per ESPN, the former USC and Boise State quarterback will continue his college career with the Miners. Nelson was the No. 2 QB at Boise State this season after transferring from USC following his freshman season in 2023. Through two seasons of college football, Nelson has played in four games. He threw three passes in one game at USC and was 12-of-17 for 128 yards and a pick in three games at Boise State. He’ll have three more years of eligibility remaining. When he signed with USC, Nelson was the No. 4 pro style QB in the class of 2023 and the No. 14 player in the country. Dequan Finn is heading back to the MAC. The former Toledo star is transferring to Miami (Ohio) after spending the 2024 season at Baylor. Finn was the 2023 MAC player of the year with the Rockets as he was 201-of-317 passing for 2,657 yards and 22 TDs along with 563 rushing yards and seven scores on the ground. However, he played in just three games at Baylor in 2024 as Sawyer Robertson emerged as the team’s starting quarterback during the season. In limited playing time at Baylor, Finn was 23-of-43 passing for 307 yards and three touchdowns and two interceptions. He also rushed 21 times for 66 yards and two scores. Finn will be in his seventh season of college football in 2025. He has an extra season of eligibility because of the COVID-19 pandemic and also played in just three games in 2019 and reportedly applied for a medical waiver for the 2025 season. After leaving Penn State ahead of the College Football Playoff, Beau Pribula has found his new home. Pribula is set to transfer to Missouri, according to multiple reports on Sunday night. Pribula served as Drew Allar’s backup quarterback this season at Penn State, though Pribula announced that he was going to transfer away before the Nittany Lions’ blowout win over SMU in the first round of the playoffs. Allar announced he will return to Penn State next season, too. Pribula will have two years of eligibility remaining at Missouri, where he’ll likely replace Brady Cook. Pribula, a former four-star recruit, went 26-of-35 for 275 yards with five touchdowns and an interception this season. He had 242 rushing yards and four touchdowns on 38 carries, too. Missouri also has Drew Pyne, who backed up Cook this past season, on its roster. The Tigers went 9-3 this season, the fifth under coach Eli Drinkwitz. They will wrap up their season against Iowa in the TransPerfect Music City Bowl on Dec. 30. Michigan was looking for a veteran quarterback who might provide a one-year bridge to five-star recruit Bryce Underwood. The Wolverines found one with Fresno State transfer Mikey Keene, who has one more year of eligibility. As a two-year starter for the Bulldogs, Keene threw for 5,868 yards and 42 touchdowns, completing 68.7% of his passes. He is also familiar with Michigan’s new offensive coordinator Chip Lindsey, whom he played under at UCF in 2022. Michigan’s QB play has major room for improvement after the 2024 season. The Wolverines ranked near the worst in the nation in passing offense, averaging 133.6 yards per game and 5.5 yards per attempt. Davis Warren threw for 1,126 yards, six touchdowns and nine interceptions in eight games, while Alex Orji and Jack Tuttle also started games last season. Orji has entered the transfer portal while Tuttle retired from football due to injury. Warren has a fifth year of eligibility remaining and could return. Redshirt freshman Jadyn Davis will also be in the QB mix with Underwood and Keene. After a huge season at Cal, Fernando Mendoza is headed to the Big Ten. Mendoza committed to play at Indiana next season, according to ESPN’s Pete Thamel. Mendoza, who was one of the top quarterbacks available in the portal this offseason, threw for 3,004 yards and 16 touchdowns at Cal. His younger brother is a freshman quarterback at Indiana, too. The Hoosiers are coming off of their best season in school history. They won a program high 11 games and reached the College Football Playoff, though they fell to Notre Dame in the opening round. Kurtis Rourke led the Hoosiers in his final college season, and he racked up 3,042 yards with 29 touchdowns and five interceptions. Former Texas and Duke quarterback Maalik Murphy is heading west. Murphy committed to Oregon State on Thursday according to multiple reports. He joins the Beavers after one season in Durham following his transfer from Texas. Murphy was 254-of-421 passing for 2,933 yards and 26 TDs with 12 interceptions in 2024. He spent the 2023 season as Texas’ No. 2 quarterback and started in Quinn Ewers’ absence when Ewers suffered a shoulder injury. However, due to the timing of the transfer portal, he left the Longhorns before the College Football Playoff. Murphy will have two seasons of eligibility with the Beavers. Oregon State went 5-7 in 2024 as three different quarterbacks played in at least five games. After Murphy entered the transfer portal at the end of the season, Duke moved quickly to secure a commitment from Tulane's Darian Mensah. One of the most productive QBs in college football during the 2023 season is heading to Colorado. Liberty's Kaidon Salter committed to Colorado on Wednesday for his final season of eligibility. Salter had 44 total touchdowns in 2023 as Liberty went undefeated and won Conference USA before losing to Oregon in the Fiesta Bowl. Salter returned to Liberty for the 2024 season after he briefly entered the portal following the Fiesta Bowl loss. Former Maryland QB Billy Edwards said Monday that he was heading to Wisconsin. Edwards was 273-of-420 passing for 2,881 yards and 15 TDs with nine interceptions over 11 games in 2024. He also rushed for 148 yards and five touchdowns. Edwards appeared in 15 games over his first two seasons at Maryland before becoming the team’s primary QB in 2024. Wisconsin is undergoing an overhaul at the QB position as the team made a coordinator change at the end of the season. QBs Braedyn Locke and Tyler Van Dyke have entered the transfer portal already. Locke was the team’s starter for most of the season after Van Dyke suffered a torn ACL against Alabama. Washington State QB John Mateer was one of the most dynamic players in college football in 2024. He'll be playing at a new school in 2025. Mateer is entering the portal after leading college football with 44 total TDs. He threw for 29 scores and rushed for 15 others as he had at least one passing TD and one rushing TD in 10 of Washington State's 12 games. The Nittany Lions will have a new backup behind Drew Allar for the College Football Playoff. No. 2 QB Beau Pribula announced Sunday that he was entering the transfer portal ahead of the postseason. Pribula lamented the timing of his announcement because of college football's calendar, and his sentiments were backed up by coach James Franklin, who said he supported his QB's decision to find a new school. Pribula's decision to transfer came a day before Allar announced he will return to Penn State for the 2025 season. Pribula saw significant playing time in 2024 behind Allar. He was 26-of-35 passing for 275 yards and five TDs and rushed 38 times for 242 yards and four scores while appearing in all 13 of PSU's games. The Louisville Cardinals will likely have a one-year transfer starting at quarterback for a second straight season. Former USC QB Miller Moss committed to the Cardinals on Saturday. Moss was USC’s starter for much of the season in 2024 before he was replaced by Jayden Maiava. Moss was 233-of-362 passing for 2,555 yards with 18 TDs and nine interceptions across nine games. The Cardinals and coach Jeff Brohm got an up-close look at what Moss can do in the Holiday Bowl at the end of the 2023 season. With Caleb Williams opting out for the NFL Draft, Moss started the game and was 23-of-33 for 372 yards and six TDs. Tyler Shough spent the 2024 season as Louisville’s starter after stints at Oregon and Texas Tech. In his seventh season of college football, Shough has completed 63% of his passes and thrown for 23 TDs and just six interceptions. Auburn added a second starting QB in less than a week on Monday when Stanford’s Ashton Daniels committed to the Tigers. In 11 games in 2024, Daniels was 170-of-271 passing for 1,700 yards and 10 TDs with 12 interceptions. He also was the Cardinal’s leading rusher with 148 carries for 669 yards and three TDs. Daniels has appeared in 33 games over his Stanford career and is 366-of-602 passing for 3,986 yards. His commitment came days after former Oklahoma QB Jackson Arnold committed to Auburn. The Tigers will have a new starter in 2025 after Payton Thorne is out of eligibility and Hank Brown transferred to Iowa. Dual-threat QB Devon Dampier is heading to Utah. The Utes got a commitment from Dampier on Dec. 11 after the Utes hired former New Mexico offensive coordinator Jason Beck to call plays. Dampier thrived under Beck in 2024 as one of the most underrated players in college football. Dampier was 226-of-390 passing for 2,768 yards and 12 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. He also rushed 155 times for 1,166 yards and 19 scores. He was the only player to rush for over 1,000 yards while throwing for over 2,500 yards this season. Dampier is set to be the presumptive starter for the Utes as they attempt to rebound from a poor 2024. QB Isaac Wilson was the team’s primary starter after Cam Rising’s multiple injuries. Wilson was briefly in the transfer portal before recommitting to Utah. After an ignominious end to his Boston College career, Thomas Castellanos is heading to Florida State. The former BC QB entered the transfer portal at the end of the season after he lost his starting job in November. Through eight games in 2024, Castellanos threw for 1,366 yards and 18 TDs. But Castellanos’ season was effectively over after Grayson James replaced him in a win over Syracuse. Castellanos stepped away from the team after BC coach Bill O’Brien announced that James would remain the team’s primary QB and announced he was heading into the portal a short time later. Conner Weigman decided to stay in Texas after transferring from Texas A&M. The former Aggies starter committed to Houston after putting his name in the portal. Weigman was the team’s starting quarterback but lost his job to Marcel Reed during the Aggies’ comeback win over LSU. A former four-star recruit, Weigman has dealt with injuries during each of the past two seasons. He missed time in 2024 because of a shoulder injury and played in just four games in 2023 before a foot injury sidelined him for the rest of the season. Duke effectively made an early transfer portal QB trade once the 2024 season ended. Starter Maalik Murphy entered the portal after one season with the Blue Devils. Just days after Murphy said he was transferring, Duke added former Tulane QB Darian Mensah. Mensah was one of the top-rated QBs in the portal since he announced he was leaving Tulane two days after the AAC title game. He threw for over 2,723 yards and 22 TDs as a redshirt freshman in 2024.",6,[],2025-01-06 13:54:58,2025-01-09 00:31:28

She’s following the lead of Jimmy Kimmel, who called the weight loss medication “Hollywood’s worst-kept secret” in his monologue at the 2023 Oscars, as GLP-1s were growing in popularity. But now, there’s nothing secret about these drugs and their prevalence inside and outside Los Angeles’s elite. So much so that Lilly, the medication company that manufactures Zepbound, sponsored the CBS broadcast Sunday night. Here are all of the ways, subtle and not so subtle, that weight loss medications and conversations made their way into the big night. Kathy Bates’s slimmer figure “turned heads” on the red carpet, according to People. The actress, who was nominated for her work on Matlock, debuted a 100-pound weight loss in September, after years of diet and lifestyle changes, in addition to going on Ozempic to address insulin issues due to type 2 diabetes. Her appearance on the Golden Globes red carpet sparked multiple headlines. Glaser didn’t stop with the weight jokes. She made another diet-related jab when she mentioned “the hardest-working actors” in the room: the servers. “Give it up,” she said to the attendees. “They’ll be bringing you your cocktails to drink and your food — that you’ll look at.” And there were many. During the first commercial break, audiences at home were served WeightWatchers’s latest campaign, promoting the brand’s clinical program, which offers registered dietitians, doctors and GLP-1 prescriptions to members. Olivia Newton-John’s “Physical” was sampled into a jingle with the lyrics “Let’s get clinical.” Multiple ads for Mounjaro, Ozempic and Lilly’s Zepbound all appeared during subsequent breaks. There was also a commercial for compounded semaglutide by Hers. While jokes about the Golden Globes being sponsored by these weight loss drug companies had already begun, it wasn’t until the near end of the broadcast that it was announced that Lilly, the company behind Mounjaro and Zepbound, actually sponsored it. The medical manufacturer had sparked conversation around off-brand use, particularly by celebrities, with a commercial that was released just ahead of the 2024 Oscars in March. ""Some people have been using medicine never meant for them for the smaller dress or tux, for a big night, for vanity. But that's not the point,” the ad’s narrator said. ""People whose health is affected by obesity are the reason we work on these medications. It matters who gets them."" The fine print on the latest ad reads, “Zepbound is not for cosmetic weight loss.” Glaser was right. Ozempic was the frontrunner of online conversations during and after the Golden Globes aired. An Ozempic commercial during the Golden Globes. How fitting. — Benny Boy (@Camel_Crushin) January 6, 2025 Wicked, who?

https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/flow-golden-globes-streaming-095613774.html,"What is Flow, the animated indie movie that beat Disney to the Golden Globe?",,Entertainment,Yahoo Movies UK,4 min read,"Somehow, a Latvian animated film about a cat beat two Disney movies and Wallace and Gromit to win at the Golden Globes. Flow is something special.",Tom Beasley·Contributor,2025-01-06T12:29:31.000Z,"One of the biggest surprises of this year's Golden Globes came in the Best Animated Feature category. Rather than an enormous Disney hit, the award went to Flow — a dialogue-free, independent animation from Latvia. Flow's win is all the more impressive because it's not as if this was a particularly lean year for animation at the Globes. The category contained two mammoth Disney movies in the shape of Pixar sequel Inside Out 2 — the highest-grossing film of 2024 — and song-and-dance sequel Moana 2, which is closing in on the billion-dollar mark worldwide. Even away from Disney, the category also included emotionally potent DreamWorks hit The Wild Robot, the triumphant return of Wallace and Gromit for Vengeance Most Fowl, and the dark stop-motion story Memoir of a Snail. So how did Flow rise to the top? Directed and co-written by Gints Zilbalodis, Flow is an inventive and emotional adventure story about a cat trying to survive when its home is ravaged by a near-biblical flood. The cat jumps on a sailboat for safety and, over the course of the film, is joined by various other animals. Just like its fellow nominee The Wild Robot, it's a fantastical story with a resonant eco-parable undertone to it. These aren't anthropomorphised, talking Disney animals. They only communicate via animal noises — in most cases provided by the real animals depicted. The exception is the capybara character, whose noises are actually provided by a baby camel. Read more: Flow Is the Perfect Movie for Animation Fans, Animal Lovers, and Environmental Doomsayers (Rolling Stone, 5 min read) The movie, which was made without major studio backing and rendered using the open source graphics program Blender, has been embraced by critics. It could even end up competing on multiple fronts at the Oscars, as it's Latvia's official entry for the Best International Feature category. It's the first time the country's entry has made the 15-film shortlist. Flow stands out as something truly unique in a category that, far too often, rewards very similar films each year. There is a sense, though, that the tide is turning a little. The last two winners at both the Oscars and the Globes were Studio Ghibli's The Boy and the Heron and Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio — Netflix's innovative stop-motion take on the classic story. The days of Disney domination may well be over. Read more: How Flow, a Latvian Animated Movie with No Dialogue, Is Upending the Awards Race (People, 3 min read) The simplicity of the storytelling also helps. Without any dialogue to translate, any prejudice against ""foreign"" films disappears immediately. What's left is a universal survival tale, assisted by some very handsome animation in a visual style that looks nothing like the smooth, computer-generated sheen often relied upon by the major studios. Flow could also have been the beneficiary of a year in which a selection of equally strong studio movies split each other's votes. Inside Out 2 and The Wild Robot — and some would argue Moana 2 — are impressive blockbuster animation achievements, which may have opened the door for Flow to come through as the scrappy underdog. There's some bad news for British film fans here. Flow hasn't yet been released in this country and it's not due to arrive until 21 March, when it's getting a cinema release courtesy of Curzon. It's only likely to play in a very limited number of cinemas, but will be available to stream shortly after via the Curzon Home Cinema platform.

There's no sign of a streaming release just yet but, with the Golden Globes success in its back pocket, its cinema run will almost certainly expand. Flow is in UK cinemas from 21 March.",0,[],2025-01-06 13:54:58,2025-01-06 13:54:58
https://uk.news.yahoo.com/uk-prison-catagories-explained-map-172850389.html,What are the different categories of UK prisons and where are they?,,News,Yahoo News UK,5 min read,"There are more than 120 prisons in England and Wales, but which prisoners are held where?",James Harrison,2025-01-06T12:25:59.000Z,"Despite plans to create an extra 14,000 prison cells by 2031, the UK still faces the prospect of running out of space for inmates. The dire prediction has prompted justice secretary Shabana Mahmood to warn radical overhauls could be coming for the UK's justice system. This is expected to include how prisoners are managed and the punishments handed out for different crimes. While local authorities have been urged to fast track applications for new prisons or applications to extend and expand existing facilities, the Labour cabinet minister was blunt in admitting: “We will have more offenders monitored outside [prisons].” Here, Yahoo News UK takes a look at Britain's penal system and how offenders currently serve time and are then prepared to re-enter society. The most high security institutions in the UK's prisons estate. They are reserved for male prisoners who, if they were to escape, would pose the greatest threat to the public, the police or wider national security. This includes people convicted of the most serious crimes, such as murder, rape, armed robbery, drug smuggling or terrorism. This is the nearest equivalent the UK has to the ‘supermax’ or maximum security prison category in the US. Category A includes some of Britain’s most notorious prisons, such as HMP Belmarsh, in London; HMP Frankland, in County Durham; and HMP Manchester, formerly known as Strangeways. These have held some of the UK’s most infamous convicts, including Wayne Couzens, who kidnapped and killed Sarah Everard; Ian Huntley, the murderer of 10-year-old school girls, Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman; serial killer GP Harold Shipman; and Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper. These can be 'local' or 'training' prisons. Local prisons are used to hold prisoners brought directly from nearby courts to be held on remand or once they have been sentenced. Training prisons focus on rehabilitation, treatment for addictions and preparing inmates for reintegration into society. High Street chain Timpson, which is known for employing former prisoners, opened a shoe repair workshop in HMP Liverpool, a Category B prison, to train inmates in 2008. Category B prisons are primarily used for offenders with long custodial sentences who are deemed not to need maximum security facilities, but who are still considered to pose a significant risk. Category B includes well-known prisons such as HMP Wormwood Scrubs, in London, and HMP Parkhurst, on the Isle of Wight. Wormwood Scrubs has, at various points, housed the late EastEnders actor Leslie Grantham and musicians Pete Doherty and Keith Richards. The bulk of Britain's prisoner population is held in Category C institutions, which are supposed to be used for 'training and resettlement'. These prisons are supposed to offer opportunities for skills development so inmates can find work more easily on release. Often, those housed in Category C prisons have been deemed not suitable for an 'open prison', but are not considered to pose a high risk of escape. There is also supposed to be an emphasis on educational and vocational programs to support rehabilitation. HMP Brixton, in London, is perhaps the best-known of Britain’s Category C prisons, and has held a diverse range of prisoners, such as the Kray Twins, Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger and disgraced former MP Imran Ahmad Khan. Provisional IRA member Dolours Price and her sister Marian, currently subjects of Disney+ series Say Nothing, were also housed in the prison. HMP Brixton is now also home to fine dining restaurant The Clink, where all kitchen staff and waiters are serving prisoners. Also often referred to as 'open prisons', these have minimal security and allow some prisoners to spend most of their day away from the institution 'on licence' for work, education or other approved purposes. Jeffrey Archer, the novelist and disgraced former MP, served part of his four-year sentence for perjury at Hollesley Bay, nicknamed ""Holiday Bay"", on the Suffolk coast. These are for male offenders aged 18-21 and offer education, training and other rehabilitation programmes aimed at this age bracket. For children and teenagers under the age of 18 who have been sentenced or ordered by a court to be held on remand. These are for women categorised as 'restricted status', meaning they have been convicted of the most serious crimes and are deemed to pose a risk to security or of escape. Like male prisons, they also offer rehabilitation programmes dealing with substance abuse and education to aid them on release. One of the most well-known and high-security examples is HMP Low Newton, in County Durham. Located close to HMP Frankland, which has held some of the UK’s most notorious male prisoners, Low Newton has housed serial killer Rose West and Anne Darwin, wife of ‘Canoe Man’ John Darwin. Baby killer and former nurse Lucy Letby was also dispatched to Low Newton following her conviction on seven murder charges in 2023. Low security facilities are used for women nearing the end of their sentences In England and Wales, the status of prisoners is determined by: Their risk of escape The risk of harm to the public, if they escape Their threat to the overall control and stability of whichever prison they are sent to",0,[],2025-01-06 13:54:58,2025-01-06 13:54:58

But being the show's 'villain' isn't something she enjoys. The food critic, 51, appeared on This Morning with Cat Deeley and Ben Shepherd to discuss her shiny new TV job on Celebrity MasterChef — having taken over from Gregg Wallace. Wallace has stepped aside from MasterChef after complaints to the BBC from 13 people, including Newsnight host Kirsty Wark who accused him of inappropriate sexual comments during filming. Wallace's lawyers have been quoted by BBC as saying: ""It is entirely false that he engages in behaviour of a sexually harassing nature."" More celebrities, including Penny Lancaster, have spoken out since the news broke. With a wealth of experience in the food circles, it's no surprise Dent was asked to step into the hosting role alongside John Torode on Celebrity MasterChef amid the investigation. Over the years she has been a familiar face on MasterChef as a guest judge and last year competed on MasterChef: Battle Of The Critics.

Dent had the presenters laughing. Only for ""10 seconds"" did she worry about taking on the big role within the franchise. Dent concluded: ""But now I have those reigns."" Clearly excited to be a part of Celebrity MasterChef in a big way, Dent hailed it as a ""dream come true"". Dent said: ""Look you are absolutely right, it's one of the most wonderful shows on British TV. When you go out into public, you feel that warmth. You can't eat anywhere in privacy ever again or even go into your supermarket without people looking into your trolley. ""So it is lovely. It's a dream come true to move to this role. It's a very different role. Now I've got a lot, before now it was judging. I was never the person who had to look them in the eye and send them home. Now I am that person. Now I am the baddie."" Although Dent is delighted to step up to the role, she confessed she doesn't enjoy being the villain of the show — whether that's sending someone home from the show or writing a bad review. ""I don't enjoy doing that,"" she explained. ""I think people think I go out for dinner and want it to be bad to write horrible things, I absolutely don't. I want the best for these people. Sending people home is horrible."" While reality TV can get a bad reputation for being scripted, Dent — who previously starred on I'm a Celebrity — wanted to clear up that it couldn't be further from the truth when it came to Celebrity MasterChef. The food expert shared her admiration for those taking part as she said the celebrities taking part are driven to win. She said: ""People think with reality TV that it's all a bit fake. People don't care if they go home. But no. Especially with Celebrity MasterChef. Once people have been in that show and cooked twice in that kitchen they've got their eye on the prize, they are sleepless, they've done nothing but think about soufflé for 17 nights in a row. They want to win."" When it was made public that Dent was going to replace Wallace on MasterChef, Torode — who has presented the BBC show since 2005 — shared his support. He said: ""I have loved working with Grace on MasterChef over the years. She has been an excellent guest, an inspiring critic and also set some incredible challenges. ""Expertise is what MasterChef is all about, from the contestants to our wonderful production team, to us as judges. ""The love of food, the love of MasterChef, and that unquestionable expertise, makes Grace the perfect person to step in alongside me as judge for the forthcoming Celebrity MasterChef series.""

Johnson and Diesel notoriously feuded during their time making “Fast and Furious” movies, but their beef came to an official end in 2023 after Johnson shocked fans by popping up as Luke Hobbs in a “Fast X” mid-credits scene. Diesel had extended an invitation to Johnson in November 2021 to join “Fast X,” but Johnson said at the time that “I would not be returning to the franchise.” That turned out to be a bluff, and Johnson and Diesel will once again star in a movie together via the upcoming 11th “Fast” movie.

Word soon got out that Johnson was referring to Diesel, who later told Men’s Health in 2021 that the “tough love” he gave The Rock in trying to get a great performance out of him is what led to tension on set. “It was a tough character to embody, the Hobbs character,” Diesel said at the time. “My approach at the time was a lot of tough love to assist in getting that performance where it needed to be. As a producer to say, ‘Okay, we’re going to take Dwayne Johnson, who’s associated with wrestling, and we’re going to force this cinematic world, audience members, to regard his character as someone that they don’t know.’” Diesel stressed that he needed to step in to get the Hobbs performance he wanted out of The Rock, adding: “Hobbs hits you like a ton of bricks. That’s something that I’m proud of, that aesthetic. That took a lot of work. We had to get there and sometimes, at that time, I could give a lot of tough love. Not Felliniesque, but I would do anything I’d have to do in order to get performances in anything I’m producing.” The two apparently squashed whatever beef existed so that Johnson could return as Hobbs in “Fast X,” setting up the character to be a more full-fledged lead in the upcoming 11th “Fast & Furious” movie. “Last summer Vin and I put all the past behind us,” Johnson tweeted after “Fast X” opened in theaters “We’ll lead with brotherhood and resolve — and always take care of the franchise, characters & FANS that we love.” The duo’s “Fast & Furious” co-star John Cena went on the “Armchair Expert” podcast last year and was asked by host Dax Shepard about the rumors concerning Johnson and Diesel’s on-set tussle. The host said “that was a rough pairing.” “There’s certainly rumors about that. I can’t deny that,” Cena said. “You have two very alpha, driven people. You get two, there can only be one.” Best of Variety New Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week What's Coming to Disney+ in January 2025 What's Coming to Netflix in January 2025 Sign up for Variety's Newsletter.

Biden is invoking the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) to prevent new fossil fuel developments off the East and West coasts of the U.S. as well as in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico and Alaska’s North Bering Sea. The law gives presidents the power to permanently withdraw parts of the Outer Continental Shelf from future oil and gas leasing—but doesn’t include a provision for how another president could revoke such an order. Trump would therefore likely have to get Congress to change the law before he could undo Biden’s action. Biden’s decision, which could pose problems for Trump’s plans to quickly ramp up fossil fuel production when he returns to office this month, was condemned by Trump’s incoming press secretary. “This is a disgraceful decision designed to exact political revenge on the American people who gave President Trump a mandate to increase drilling and lower gas prices,” Karoline Leavitt wrote in a post on X. “Rest assured, Joe Biden will fail, and we will drill, baby, drill.” This is a disgraceful decision designed to exact political revenge on the American people who gave President Trump a mandate to increase drilling and lower gas prices. Rest assured, Joe Biden will fail, and we will drill, baby, drill. https://t.co/NvWx7oA2vU — Karoline Leavitt (@karolineleavitt) January 6, 2025 In a statement, President Biden said drilling in the areas he’s seeking to protect “could cause irreversible damage to places we hold dear and is unnecessary to meet our nation’s energy needs.” “It is not worth the risks,” Biden said. “As the climate crisis continues to threaten communities across the country and we are transitioning to a clean energy economy, now is the time to protect these coasts for our children and grandchildren.” Mike Sommers, the president of oil and gas industry group American Petroleum Institute, claimed in a statement that the Biden Administration decision is “politically motivated.” “Congress and the incoming administration should fully leverage the nation’s vast offshore resources as a critical source of affordable energy, government revenue and stability around the world,” Sommers said. “We urge policymakers to use every tool at their disposal to reverse this politically motivated decision and restore a pro-American energy approach to federal leasing.” Biden highlighted in his announcement the bipartisan support that has been given to protecting certain areas from drilling. “From California to Florida, Republican and Democratic Governors, Members of Congress, and coastal communities alike have worked and called for greater protection of our ocean and coastlines from harms that offshore oil and natural gas drilling can bring,” Biden said.",2.3k,[],2025-01-06 13:54:58,2025-01-07 02:26:31

Russian military bloggers first reported attacks by Ukrainian tanks and infantry on positions in Kursk shortly after dawn on Sunday. They said that Ukrainian forces were attacking towards the village of Bolshoye Soldatskoye, 15 miles north-east of Sudzha, the Ukrainian stronghold in the region. “The enemy is driving forward with tanks and armoured personnel carriers full of soldiers,” the Archangel of Spetsnaz Z, told its 1.15 million subscribers on Telegram. Both Ukrainian and Russian officials later also confirmed the attacks, likely launched to strengthen Kyiv’s position ahead of potential peace talks. Russia’s Ministry of Defence said that its forces were “defeating” Ukrainian military formations in Kursk but Andrii Yermak, head of the Ukrainian presidential office, said that the attacks had scared and worried Russian forces. “From the Kursk region, good news. Russia is getting what it deserves,” he said. The head of Ukraine’s Centre for Countering Disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, also said the Russians “were attacked from several directions. It was a surprise for them”. But reports from Kursk detailed Russian resistance and described a series of fierce, and at times, confused battles. Pro-Russia Telegrams also circulated video of an alleged Russian drone strike destroying a Ukrainian-operated British Challenger 2 tank. The claim could not be independently verified. WarGonzo, a Russian blogging Telegram channel, said that the attack appeared to have been carefully planned because Ukraine had built up a counteroffensive force based on Nato equipment over November and December in neighbouring regions. “At night, the enemy carried out measures to clear the approaches,” it said. Other Russian military bloggers also said that Ukraine had deployed sappers to clear land mines and specialist drone-jamming units ahead of its main attacking force. Analysts said that the Ukrainian offensive may be a final gamble by Volodymyr Zelensky, the president, ahead of potential peace talks once Donald Trump is inaugurated as US president on Jan. 20. Although Ukrainian forces are losing ground along the eastern Donbas frontline, by holding on to captured areas of the Kursk region they can still embarrass and weaken Putin, they said. The Russian president has thrown thousands of his and North Korean soldiers into battle in the Kursk region over the past couple of months, pledging to retake it. These forces have got back more than half of the area captured by Ukrainian forces but have failed to retake the town of Sudzha. John Foreman, a former British military attache in Russia, said that the biggest impact of Sunday’s Ukrainian counteroffensive would be psychological. He said: “It helps remind Team Trump that Ukraine has agency and must have a say in its own future. It also embarrasses Putin again after reportedly setting various deadlines for expelling Ukraine from Russian territory.” The reaction from the Kremlin suggested that it was taking the threat seriously. It dispatched one of its top generals to Kursk within hours of the attack to organise the Russian response. Gen Yunus-Bek Yevkurov was photographed meeting Alexander Khinshtein, the acting governor of the Kursk region in what appears to be designed as a tough response to the Ukrainian attack. In August, when Ukrainian forces first captured areas of Kursk, the Kremlin was criticised for its slow and weak response. Commenting on his meeting with Gen Yevkurov, Mr Khinshtein said that Kursk “will do everything possible to help our Armed Forces in their sacred fight against Nazism” but he couldn’t divulge any operational secrets. Gen Yevkurov is one of Putin’s favourite generals. Putin promoted him in December to the rank of Army General, the only level in the Russian Army’s rank system below Field Marshal, and in 2023 trusted him to negotiate with rebel mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin during an attempted coup. Gen Yevkurov is also in charge of deploying mercenaries and military aid to Russian proxy states in Africa. The Ukrainian attack in the Kursk region came the day after Mr Zelensky said that the Kremlin’s losses in the region were mounting. He said on Saturday that the Kremlin had lost an entire battalion of North Korean soldiers in the Kursk region in the past two days. A battalion usually numbers about 500 soldiers. Mr Zelensky has not officially commented on the Kursk attack. Thank you for following our live coverage. Ukrainian forces have deployed British Challenger 2 tanks in Sunday’s surprise counter-offensive in the Kursk region, Russian military bloggers have said. Rybar, one of the most influential Russian military bloggers, said that Russian forces had destroyed at least one the Ukrainian-operated Challenger 2 tanks. “It was destroyed by drone crews from the 155th Guards Marine Brigade of the Pacific Fleet,” Rybar reported under a video of a drone striking a tank. The claim could not be independently verified but Ukraine has previously deployed Challenger tanks and other Nato kit in the Kursk region. A Russian military blogger has said North Korean soldiers have reportedly entered combat in response to Ukrainian attacks in Kursk Oblast. In November, Ukraine reported its troops had engaged in combat with North Korean troops in the Kursk region for the first time. The appearance of North Korean soldiers came in response to Ukraine’s surprise attack which advanced up to 18 miles (30km) into Russian land in August. Russia’s drones, missiles and guided aerial bombs which attacked Ukraine this week contained more than 50,000 foreign components, said Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday. According to Mr Zelensky, Russian troops launched more than 630 strike drones, around 740 guided aerial bombs, and nearly 50 missiles of various types this week. He said they contained over 50,000 sanctioned components sourced from around the world. “The sanctions pressure on supply chains for foreign components remains insufficient. Russia continues to acquire the components and manufacturing tools it needs – almost globally – and uses them in the weapons it employs to terrorise Ukraine,” the Ukrainian president wrote on social media. Russia has reduced the use of armoured vehicles in assaults on areas of active combat in recent weeks, according to the Institute of the Study of War. Analysts say this is likely to conserve equipment as Soviet stockpiles shrink. Ukrainian military sources have also recently observed Russian forces using fewer armoured vehicles and conducting fewer mechanised assaults on the Kurakhove front following significant vehicle losses in October and November 2024. The spokesperson for a Ukrainian brigade operating on the Kurakhove front stated on 3 January that Russian forces have shifted to primarily using infantry for assaults in the area over the past few weeks, with armoured vehicles now being used mainly as fire support for infantry operations. The New York Times reported on December 31 that a Ukrainian lieutenant colonel stated that Russian forces are increasingly using electric scooters, motorcycles, and all-terrain vehicles during assaults in eastern Ukraine, possibly as part of ongoing Russian efforts to offset armoured vehicle losses. Ukrainian forces reportedly destroyed or damaged over 3,000 Russian tanks and almost 9,000 armoured vehicles in 2024 as Russia continues to accrue vehicle losses that are likely unsustainable in the medium-term, the ISW said. The head of Ukraine’s Centre for Countering Disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, said on Telegram that “defence forces are working” in the area. “In the Kursk region, the Russians are very worried because they were attacked from several directions, and it was a surprise for them,” he said. Russia’s defence ministry may believe its forces are “defeating” Ukraine’s counteroffensive in the Kursk region, but Vladimir Putin clearly doesn’t. He has sent one of his toughest and most trusted generals to organise the fight back against Ukraine’s surprise Sunday morning counteroffensive. Gen Yunus-Bek Yevkurov arrived for an emergency meeting in Kursk with the acting governor less than a couple of hours after Ukrainian tanks started rumbling towards Russian positions. And by sending Gen Yevkurov to Kursk, Putin has shown his hand. Although it is still unclear how successful the Ukrainian counteroffensive will be, he is worried. Repelling Ukraine’s advance into Russia’s southern Kursk region has become a priority project for Putin before Donald Trump is inaugurated as US president on January 20 and attempts to impose a peace deal. Turning up to negotiations with Ukraine still holding on to Russian territory, even small parcels, will weaken Putin.And Volodymyr Zelensky knows this. The Ukrainian president may have calculated that with Ukrainian forces being pushed back along the main frontline in the eastern Donbas region, applying pressure in Kursk is his best option. If his forces can push back Russian soldiers in Kursk, and hold on to captured areas for another two or three weeks, Mr Zelensky may feel that he can strengthen his negotiating position. The Kremlin has sent one of its top generals to the Kursk region to oversee Russian forces’ defence against a Ukrainian counteroffensive. Gen Yunus-Bek Yevkurov, Russia’s deputy defence minister, arrived in Kursk on Sunday morning, according to Alexander Khinshtein, acting governor for the Kursk region. Mr Khinshtein said that he had held a “working meeting” with Gen Yevkurov but that he couldn’t divulge details. “I can say one thing for sure: the government of the Kursk region will do everything possible to help our Armed Forces in their sacred fight against Nazism,” he said, using a Russian slur against Ukraine. Yevkurov is one of Vladimir Putin’s favourite generals. Putin promoted Yevrukov to the rank of full Army General in December, the only level below Field Marshall in Russian military ranks. As well as overseeing Russian border security, Putin has also given Yevkurov the delicate and high-profile task of organising Russian mercenary forces and military aid to his proxies in Africa. “Around 9:00 Moscow time (0600 GMT), in order to stop the advance of Russian troops in the Kursk direction, the enemy launched a counterattack with an assault group consisting of two tanks, a mine clearing vehicle, and twelve armoured combat vehicles with paratroops towards Berdin village,” the Russian defence ministry said in a statement. “Artillery and aviation of the North group of (Russian) forces defeated the assault group of the Ukrainian Armed Forces,” it added. Ukraine carefully planned its Kursk counteroffensive by building up its forces and then sending minesweepers to clear routes towards Russian lines ahead of the attack, Russian military bloggers have said. WarGonzo, a pro-Russia military blogger, said Ukraine had also deployed specialist drone-jamming units in its counteroffensive. “At night, the enemy carried out measures to clear the approaches,” said the Telegram channel. Colonelcassad, a pro-Russia military blogging channel, said that Ukraine had moved “large volumes” of US and Nato equipment in November and December to the Sumy and Cherniv regions that border Russia ahead of the counteroffensive. Russian state media has quoted the Russian defence ministry as saying that Ukraine has launched a counter-attack in Russia’s western Kursk region. Pro-Russian military channel Operativnye Svodki (Operational Reports) has said that its units are “heroically holding the line” amid Ukraine’s new attack in Russia’s western Kursk region. It said artillery and small-arms battles were taking place, and Ukraine was using Western-armoured vehicles to bring in large numbers of infantry. The reports, which could not be independently verify, said fighting was concentrated near the town of Bolshoye Soldatskoye. Ukrainian and Western assessments say that some 11,000 troops from Russia’s ally North Korea have been deployed in the Kursk region to support Moscow’s forces. Russia has neither confirmed nor denied their presence. A Russian channel has claimed that Ukraine has built up forces in Sumy Oblast across the border from the Glushkovsky district of the Kursk oblast. Russian military bloggers have published a grainy photo claiming to be a Ukrainian tank column advancing on Russian positions in the Kursk region. War Kitten, a Telegram channel with 400,000 subscribers, said the photo showed the Ukrainian tank column taking hits. “This is a column of Ukrainian Armed Forces advancing in the direction of a farm by Berdin. Some of the vehicles have been destroyed,” it said. The village of Berdin lies around 10 miles north-east of Sudzha, the Ukrainian stronghold in the Kursk region, and has been the focus of fierce fighting. Volodymyr Zelensky said he will again call on allies to boost its air defences at this week’s meeting in Germany. Mr Zelensky said that dozens of partner countries will participate in the meeting at the Ramstein Air Base in Germany on Thursday, “including those who can help boost our capabilities not only to defend against missiles but also against guided bombs and Russian aviation.” “We will discuss this with them and continue to persuade them,” Mr Zelensky said in his evening address on Saturday. “The task remains unchanged: strengthening our air defence.” A prominent Kremlin propagandist has mocked Ukraine’s counteroffensive in the Kursk region as a PR stunt designed to impress Donald Trump. Sergei Markov, a former Kremlin speech-writer, said that Ukraine had only launched a counteroffensive in the Kursk region to show the incoming US president that it could still take the fight to Russia. “Zelensky’s logic is that he wants to show Trump, for his own political reasons, that the Ukrainian army is strong and that there is no need to capitulate to Russia,” he said. Mr Trump is due to be inaugurated on January 20. He has said that he intends to cut military aid to Ukraine and wants to impose a peace deal to end the war. Russian military bloggers have confirmed a Ukrainian counteroffensive in Russia’s Kursk region but said that it may be a “diversionary” attack. The Rybar Telegram channel said that Ukraine has been preparing for months for a counterattack along the frontline and that Russian forces were ready to repel it. “The direction of the main counterattack is not yet clear, and the manoeuvres from the occupied part of the Kursk region may be diversionary,” it said. Russian forces have steadily pushed back Ukrainian forces along the main frontline in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region over the past six months. They have also recaptured more than half the area captured by Ukrainian forces in Russia’s Kursk region. A Russian state newspaper has said one of its freelance reporters has been killed in a drone strike near the Russian-occupied city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. Izvestia, the newspaper, said a civilian vehicle carrying the journalist, named as Alexander Martemyanov, was struck as it travelled on a highway. It said five other media workers were also injured in the attack. Moscow has accused Ukraine of deliberately targeting the journalist. Ukraine has not commented. “The Ukrainian army launched a drone strike on a civilian car carrying Izvestia’s freelance correspondent Alexander Martemyanov,” the news outlet reported on its Telegram channel, adding: “The car was located far from the line of contact.” Maria Zakharova, the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, called the incident “deliberate murder”. Russian airports in the cities of Kazan, Nizhnekamsk, Izhevsk and Perm, which temporarily halted flights on Sunday morning to ensure the safety of civilian aircraft, have resumed normal operations, the aviation watchdog Rosaviatsia said. It did not specify a reason for the pause in flight arrivals and departures, but Russian airports have previously closed due to a risk of Ukrainian drone strikes in the area. The restrictions at the airports were all lifted by 11:00 am (0800 GMT), Rosaviatsia said. The four cities are located east of Moscow. Kazan’s airport suspended flights on Dec. 21 due to a Ukrainian drone attack on a residential complex and other areas of the city in which no one was injured. Ukraine’s air defence shot down 61 out of 103 drones launched by Russia in an overnight attack on Sunday, the air force said. It said that 42 other drones were “lost” in a reference to Kyiv using electronic warfare. There were no immediate reports of major damage or casualties.

Omar Khan—AKA 'the Khan Artist'—has officially outsmarted the Chicago Bears for the second time in just over two years. While the outcome of the Chase Claypool trade was clearly one-sided in Pittsburgh's favor, the winner of 2024's Justin Fields trade seemed debatable. However, as the trade became official last night, the Steelers will only need to send a 2025 sixth-round draft pick to the Bears. Fields would have needed to play in 51% of the Steelers' snaps for the conditional sixth-round pick to escalate to a fourth-rounder—and Russell Wilson's emergence as the Steelers' QB in Week 7 put an end to that. While it remains to be seen if the Steelers will re-sign Fields this upcoming 2025 offseason—and properly develop him—no one can deny that acquiring a player of his caliber for just a sixth-round draft pick is an absolute steal. Khan has been incredible since taking over the GM role in 2022, and fans of the Black and Gold should be excited about what he has in store for 2025 offseason and NFL Draft.

Stone,2025-01-06T12:00:13.000Z,"Social media users are currently reminiscing about Kat Dennings’ performance as Max Black in 2 Broke Girls, with a particularly popular post on X gaining significant attention. The post, which includes images from the CBS sitcom, has attracted massive engagement as viewers fondly recall Dennings’ memorable portrayal of the sharp-tongued waitress character. Fans and social media users have expressed their thoughts in droves. One user humorously commented, “She’s an inspiration. I wish my breasticles were as big as hers sometimes. I should drink more milk. Gotta play the hand one is dealt.” Another said, “This is the most mother anyone has ever mothered in their life,” while others praised Dennings’ iconic role with comments like, “That’s a bad bitch right there,” and “Every frame of her was perfect.” The post has reignited discussions about 2 Broke Girls, which aired for six seasons from 2011 to 2017. Starring Dennings as the sarcastic and street-smart Max Black and Beth Behrs as Caroline Channing, a wealthy socialite-turned-waitress, the show followed the duo’s attempts to launch a cupcake business while navigating life in Brooklyn. The series quickly became a fan favorite for its sharp humor and Max’s iconic one-liners, largely delivered by Dennings with her signature dry wit. Despite its initial success and a dedicated fan base, CBS canceled 2 Broke Girls in 2017. The decision surprised many viewers, especially since the show had strong ratings during its earlier seasons and performed well in syndication. However, several factors contributed to its cancellation. 1. Controversial Humor and Criticism of Stereotypes The show faced ongoing backlash for its use of racial and cultural stereotypes, particularly in its supporting characters like Han Lee (Matthew Moy), the Korean-American diner owner, and Sophie Kaczyński (Jennifer Coolidge), the Polish neighbor. Critics argued that the humor often leaned on outdated and offensive tropes rather than nuanced storytelling. Publications such as The Atlantic and The Guardian called out the show for perpetuating stereotypes that made some viewers uncomfortable. 2. Business and Licensing Challenges Unlike many CBS shows, 2 Broke Girls was produced by Warner Bros. Television, meaning CBS did not own the series outright. According to The Hollywood Reporter, this created challenges during syndication negotiations, as Warner Bros. sought a lucrative deal that CBS found difficult to justify. The network reportedly opted to free up space in its primetime lineup for newer shows it owned, such as Young Sheldon. 3. Declining Ratings While the show maintained a loyal fan base, its ratings dipped during later seasons, making it less competitive in CBS’s crowded roster. TV analysts at Variety and Deadline noted that although 2 Broke Girls had a solid start, it struggled to maintain its initial momentum, particularly as the television landscape became more saturated with new content. 4. Creative Fatigue Some critics also argued that the show’s premise began to feel repetitive after several seasons. As Vulture noted in a retrospective piece, while Dennings and Behrs’ chemistry remained strong, the storylines often revolved around the same jokes and conflicts, leading to creative stagnation. Kat Dennings’ performance as Max Black remains one of the most beloved aspects of 2 Broke Girls. Her sharp comedic timing, unapologetic attitude, and undeniable charm helped define the character and make her a cultural icon. Fans continue to celebrate her unique beauty, wit, and ability to deliver memorable one-liners. One recent X user wrote, “She’s so [expletive] hot oh my god,” while another noted, “Kat Dennings as Max is peak sitcom perfection. Nobody else could have pulled that off.” This question is, of course, subjective, but Dennings is undeniably one of the most talked-about actresses in sitcom history. Her distinctive looks and magnetic screen presence have made her a fan favorite, not just in 2 Broke Girls but in other projects like WandaVision and Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist. Whether or not she claims the title of the “most beautiful sitcom actress,” Dennings’ impact on television and pop culture is undeniable. The viral resurgence of her 2 Broke Girls photos serves as a testament to her lasting influence and the fondness fans still hold for her portrayal of Max Black.

ATLANTA - The blast of Arctic air arrived in metro Atlanta on Monday evening with the coldest yet to come. The FOX 5 Storm Team is monitoring the possibility of some wintry weather to accompany the Arctic blast. The wind will continue into the night with wind chills dropping into the teens early Tuesday morning. Most of Tuesday afternoon, it will feel like it is below freezing with the wind continuing. Computer models continue to show a winter storm impacting the Southeast into the weekend. The FOX 5 Storm Team feels confident that north Georgia will see a mixed bag of precipitation, including snow, sleet, freezing rain, and, for some, a cold rain. The system will move in during the late morning hours of Friday and will stick around through the early part of Saturday. It's still too early to determine who sees what and for how long. But the likelihood of a winter storm appears to be increasing. The FOX 5 Storm Team is keeping a close eye on this developing storm.

He'll look to join a handful of Tiger receivers, finding success in the NFL. Lacy arrived at LSU in 2022 after beginning his career at Louisiana. When Brian Kelly took over the program, he was forced to rebuild. Lacy was one of several transfers that helped Kelly get roster numbers where needed. Lacy wasn't a featured player immediately but was in the rotation. Lacy caught 24 passes for 268 yards in 2022. In 2023, his role increased as LSU had the best offense in the country. Despite sharing targets with Malik Nabers and Brian Thomas Jr, Lacy caught 30 passes for 558 yards, putting him at an impressive 18.6 yards per catch. With Nabers and Thomas in the NFL, 2024 was a chance for Lacy to lead the room. He posted career highs across the board, catching 58 passes for 866 yards and nine touchdowns. His nine touchdowns are tied for most in the SEC. Where do the numbers put Lacy on LSU's all-time receiving leaderboard? With 1,692 career yards, Lacy ranks 25th in program history. He's just ahead of Reuben Randle and right behind Travin Dural. With 16 touchdowns, Lacy ranks 16th among LSU receivers. That's tied with Kayshon Boutte and Tony Moss. As mentioned, Lacy led SEC receivers in touchdowns in 2024. Lacy hauled in 112 catches in his time at LSU, putting him 24th in program history. He's one of 30 Tigers to exceed the 100+ catch mark in his career.

Warning! The following contains spoilers for the 90 Day Fiancé: Before The 90 Days episode ""Never Let Me Go."" Stream it with a Max subscription and read at your own risk! 90 Day Fiancé: Before The 90 Days was able to stretch out into the 2025 TV schedule, but only barely, as we've now arrived at the TLC series' tell-all specials. We'll finally hear from the group that I've constantly called the least-likable American cast I've seen in franchise history and learn more about their storylines. We'll also see some shocking moments, including a confrontation between two people I didn't see coming. Given that Loren Allen was married shortly after ending filming his scenes with Faith Tulod, I expected him to bring the bulk of the drama for this 90 Day Fiancé tell-all. He still might, but he might be upstaged by this heated fight between two cast members that was previewed at the end of the latest episode. In a truly bizarre scene, Adnan Abdelfattah was seen backstage walking up to Niles Valentine and Vanja Grbic, telling him it was ""not"" nice to meet them. Niles then confronts Adnan about something disrespectful the latter said in front of Niles' father, though we don't know if it's his actual father or his stand-in father, Mr. Arc. The situation escalated with Niles suggesting he'll fight Adnan for being disrespectful, removing his glasses and staring intensely into the unfazed model's eyes. As the scene ends, security moves forward to separate the two men inches from each other's faces. I didn't expect anyone in this season of 90 Day Fiancé: Before The 90 Days to threaten physical violence, but I can't state enough how wild Niles, of all people, is doing it. The same guy who was so passive in his season that he allowed his now-wife Matilda Nti to change his mind about them getting married is threatening to throw down with Tigerlily Taylor Abdelfattah's trophy husband. Where was this boldness when people in Ghana pressured him into doing many things he didn't want to do? Perhaps there's something in the water during this tell-all for 90 Day Fiancé: Before The 90 Days Season 7 because that's not the only wild moment we see. We hear Brian Muniz talking about discovering that Ingrid Rezende had a boyfriend, and Loren hinted that Faith has some surprising secrets to share. I would assume the secret is not that crazy, or he would've already shared it on a podcast like he did with other spoilers ahead of this season. 90 Day Fiancé: Before The 90 Days is winding down, but new episodes are still airing on TLC on Sundays at 8:00 p.m. ET. I'm ready for a lot of unexpected reveals and conversations and, hopefully, an idea of which couples we'll see in future seasons.",4,[],2025-01-06 13:56:03,2025-01-06 21:51:16

Faraji’s allegations involve several high-profile figures at the network, including Skip Bayless, FS1 host Joy Taylor, and Fox Sports Executive Vice President Charlie Dixon. The lawsuit accuses the defendants of sexual harassment, misconduct, and fostering a toxic work environment. Skip Bayless, a controversial figure and co-host of FS1’s “Undisputed” until mid-2024, is at the center of the lawsuit. Faraji alleges that Bayless engaged in inappropriate physical contact over a prolonged period, which included “lingering hugs” after haircuts and “pressing his body against hers, including her breasts.” The lawsuit also details an incident where Bayless allegedly offered Faraji $1.5 million for a sexual encounter, despite her repeated refusals to engage with him beyond a professional capacity. Faraji claims that her attempts to report the behavior were ignored, leaving her vulnerable to further harassment. Bayless has not issued a statement regarding the allegations, and representatives for Fox Sports declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation. The lawsuit also names Joy Taylor, a prominent FS1 host, accusing her of contributing to the hostile work environment. Faraji claims that when she reported her issues with Bayless and Dixon to Taylor, the host allegedly dismissed her concerns and told her to “get over it.” Faraji further alleges that Taylor engaged in sexual relationships with former NFL linebacker-turned-analyst Emmanuel Acho and later with Charlie Dixon to advance her career. According to the suit, these alleged relationships helped Taylor secure a more prominent position and greater opportunities at the network. Neither Taylor nor Acho has addressed the allegations publicly. Both have notably gone quiet on their social media accounts during the final regular week of the NFL season. Fans observed that Acho recently deleted a video from 2022 in which he praised Taylor, fueling speculation about his involvement in the case. Fox Sports EVP Charlie Dixon is also accused of inappropriate behavior. The lawsuit claims that Dixon created a hostile work environment, failed to address Faraji’s complaints about Bayless, and engaged in unethical behavior that compromised the safety and professionalism of the workplace. The lawsuit paints a picture of a deeply flawed corporate culture where individuals in power allegedly abused their positions without fear of accountability. The allegations have ignited a firestorm on social media, with fans and critics alike debating the implications of the lawsuit. While some have called for immediate accountability and an internal investigation, others have expressed skepticism, citing a lack of public statements from those involved. Taylor and Acho’s silence has been particularly conspicuous, given their usually active presence on platforms like Twitter and Instagram. Fans noticed Acho’s deleted video as a potential attempt to distance himself from the growing controversy. In her lawsuit, Faraji claims that her tenure at Fox Sports was marred by a pattern of systemic neglect and harassment. She describes a work environment where complaints were routinely dismissed, and employees in vulnerable positions were left without support. Faraji alleges that the behavior she endured has caused her significant emotional and professional harm. “This was not an isolated incident,” Faraji said in a statement. “This was a culture of abuse and exploitation, enabled by those at the top.” A spokesperson for Fox Sports issued a brief statement: “We take these allegations seriously and will allow the legal process to run its course. We have no further comment at this time.” The lawsuit comes at a critical time for Fox Sports, which has faced scrutiny in recent years over its workplace culture. This case is likely to prompt broader discussions about accountability and systemic reforms within the network. The lawsuit has sparked widespread discussions across sports media and beyond. Many are calling for transparency and a thorough investigation into the allegations. Others have pointed to the incident as indicative of larger issues within the sports media industry, which has long grappled with challenges related to workplace harassment and inequity. As the case unfolds, it serves as a reminder of the importance of ensuring safe and respectful workplaces. Faraji’s lawsuit may lead to significant changes at Fox Sports and possibly the broader industry, depending on its outcome. For now, all eyes remain on the key players named in the lawsuit and their next moves as public pressure continues to mount.

I've got $970,000 stashed in my 401(k) — can I retire today?",,Lifestyle,Moneywise,5 min read,You’ll need to be a diligent planner.,"Sarah Li-Cain, AFC",2025-01-06T12:06:00.000Z,"You’ve hit your late 50s, you’ve got a nice cushion in your 401(k) and suddenly you find yourself wondering if that cushion will provide you with enough comfort to retire today. The promising news is that yes, you may be able to retire today at 58 years old with $970,000 in your 401(k). But you’ve got enough life experience now to know there’s always a bit more nuance than that. A near-record number of Americans are grappling with $1,000 car payments and many drivers can't keep up. Here are 3 ways to stay ahead I'm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement — what should I do? Don't panic. Here are 3 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast) Famed economist Larry Summers issues dire inflation warning to Americans after Trump's White House win — 3 ways to help protect yourself in 2025 Retiring earlier means you’ll need to wait several years before you can start claiming Social Security benefits and be eligible for Medicare. And it means needing a solid plan on your retirement expenses, health care and even taxes. Don’t have that all set in stone? Then you may have to delay retirement. Here’s what to consider before handing in your notice. Deciding if it’s possible for you to retire will depend on whether you have a clear idea of how you’ll cover your expenses if you stop working. Since you can’t claim Social Security benefits just yet, the $970,000 in your 401(k) needs to be truly enough to cover all of your expenses until you can. Many retirees use a common retirement budgeting tactic, the 4% rule, to ensure there’s enough money from their retirement accounts when making withdrawals, even when adjusted for inflation. With $970,000 in a 401(k), you can typically withdraw $38,800 each year before taxes. Of course, your retirement income may be higher if you have more assets held in other retirement accounts. Look at your spending now and whether this will change once you retire. Aside from costs like food, clothing and transportation, take a look at what you owe as well. For example, do you still have personal loans you need to pay off? Will it be a few years before you no longer have a mortgage? If so, you need to factor in your monthly payments in your retirement budget. Retiring before 65 years old also means you’ll have to fund your own health care costs. Medicare won’t kick in until then, and your options could include COBRA (if you had a qualifying employer-provided health care plan) or other private insurance options. Read more: Are you rich enough to join the top 1%? Here's the net worth you need to rank among America’s wealthiest — plus 2 ways to build that first-class portfolio Depending on the plan, you could end up paying several hundred to around $1,000 per month in premiums. Costs can go up for couples or families. Compare your spending with your retirement income — is it enough to live on? Do you have other income sources like investments from brokerage accounts or pensions (assuming you can tap into them right now)? If not, you may need to hold off until you have more in your nest egg. Or perhaps when you can start to claim Social Security benefits if you’ll need to rely on that extra boost to afford your retirement expenses. Still want to retire early? Here’s where getting crystal clear comes in handy: if you’re not clear on your income and expenses, now and years in the future, you could be at risk of running out of money. As in, it’s still possible to make it work if you’re willing to get creative with how you can afford it. Say you estimate your retirement expenses will be $50,000 each year and your only income source is your 401(k) until you decide to claim Social Security benefits when you’re 65. In this case, you’ll need to cover around a $12,000 shortfall (it’ll depend on how much you need to pay in taxes) for the next seven years. Instead of leaving your career entirely, see if you can work part-time hours or freelance for your current employer. Side hustles or gig work is another way to fill in any income gaps. Your skills may easily lend themselves to a side business idea. That way, you can free up some time to pursue your ideal retirement lifestyle while earning income. Another option is to find ways to drastically reduce your expenses like downsizing to a smaller home, relocating to a lower cost of living area, or selling one of your cars. Giving yourself that financial breathing room can take a lot of pressure off finding part-time work, or feeling you have to wait longer before retirement is on the horizon. ‘Savers are losers’: Robert Kiyosaki warned that millions of 401(k)s and IRAs will be ‘toast’ — here's his advice for older Americans who want to protect their wealth Protect your retirement savings with these 5 essential money moves — most of which you can complete in just minutes 'It's not taxed at all': Warren Buffett shares the 'best investment' you can make when battling rising costs — take advantage today This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

The attack started over the weekend, with unverified footage circulated by Russian military bloggers showing a column of Ukrainian tanks and armoured personnel carriers heading towards the village of Berdin, a small area outside of what Ukraine currently controls in Kursk. Kyiv’s military has not officially acknowledged a fresh offensive, months after an initial incursion that caught Russia on the hop and allowed Ukraine to capture a swathe of Russian lands in the region. The head of the Ukrainian presidential office, Andriy Yermak, said: “Kursk region, good news, Russia is getting what it deserves.” Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the Ukrainian Centre for Countering Disinformation, an official body, said Ukrainian forces had launched surprise attacks against Russian forces in several locations across Kursk, months after launching its incursion in the region. Russian military bloggers, who are under the control of the Kremlin but sometimes speak more openly about the difficulties facing Moscow’s troops, suggested on the Telegram messenger app that some of their forces were “worried” about the assault. “The morning in the Kursk region is starting off worryingly again. It is obvious that yesterday’s failure will not stop the enemy and he will try to impose his will on us again today,” wrote one blogger, Yuri Podolyaka. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a US-based think tank that maps the frontline, said Ukraine had made advances into the southern outskirts of Berdin. It is to the northeast of the city of Sudzha, the most significant area held by Ukraine since the start of the first assault five months ago. The think tank added that Ukrainian forces appeared to be attacking “in at least three areas”, including towards Berdin. A second attack on the right flank appears to be directed towards the village of Pushkarnoye, east of Sudzha, while the third assault seems to be on the either side of the Ukrainian-held area, around Korenevo on the western flank. The reports come a day after Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly address on Saturday that Russian and North Korean forces had suffered significant losses in a battle for the village of Makhnovka, on the southeastern outskirts of Sudzha. He said they had suffered hundreds of casualties, citing information from the Ukrainian military chief, General Oleksandr Syrskyi. Others Russian military bloggers suggested the attacks were being conducted with hundreds of Ukrainian troops in a heavily-mechanised assault, meaning the use of tanks and armoured personnel carriers. They speculated that these attacks could be attempts to divert Russian forces, possibly from Moscow’s creeping advance in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk. Russia’s defence ministry claimed control over the town of Kurakhove in Donetsk on Monday, after months of heavy fighting. Russia controls about a fifth of Ukraine after nearly three years of war, but Ukraine’s success in seizing and retaining a slice of Russian territory in Kursk could boost its negotiating position as both sides prepare for possible peace talks this year. Both have been striving to improve their battlefield positions before US president-elect Donald Trump is sworn in on 20 January. Mr Trump has repeatedly said he will bring a quick end to the war, without saying how. Russian forces, with the help of around 11,000 North Korean troops, have been successfully shrinking Ukraine’s partial hold on the Kursk region since Kyiv launched the daring cross-border assault on 6 August last year. US secretary of state Anthony Blinken described Ukraine’s partial control over the Russian border region as key to any possible future negotiations with Russia during a visit to South Korea over the weekend. “The positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kursk region are very important, because, of course, this is what will matter for any negotiations that may take place in the coming year,” he said.",0,[],2025-01-06 13:56:03,2025-01-06 21:52:09

A lot of people say, “My life is a soap opera.” But if Harper Barash someday does so, she could actually mean it, what with her parents both being daytime stars. Mom is Kirsten Storms, who went from Days of Our Lives as Belle to General Hospital as Maxie, and Dad is her former husband, Brandon Barash, who went from General Hospital as Johnny to Days of Our Lives as Stefan (then Jake… then Stefan again). More from Soaps.com General Hospital Shocker: Michael's Death Brings Sonny and Carly Together Again - *and* Nina?!? Of course, just because Harper’s folks are in the business of continuing drama doesn’t mean at all that her life is full of Sturm und Drang. On the contrary, the youngster is being raised in laughter and love. Just look below at how she spent the day before her ninth birthday in 2023. “This girl knows how to find joy in anything,” marveled Storms. “Her spirit is goals. “I can’t believe she’s turning 8 tomorrow,” she added. Neither could we. But the math adds up, especially when you scroll down and review Harper’s whole life in pictures, starting with… More: Soap stars and their real-life moms [PHOTOS] Only two days after Harper made her debut, so to speak, Storms shared a snap of “Daddy’s lil’ princess” that was so sweet, it would’ve melted a heart made of granite. In November of 2014, Barash dropped an artistic B&W shot of Harper. “A dear friend/mentor said to me, ‘Kids teach us all we need to know about love,’” he wrote. “‘It’s a lecture. Without words. You either join or you don’t.’ I’m in.” By March of 2015, there was no mistaking that Storms had on her hands a real Mini Me in Harper. “Fries and all,” she noted. Also clear: who ruled the roost. Barash could tell during tea time with the tot that “she clearly scoffs and doesn’t approve of the position of my pinkie.” Harper wasn’t even a year old when Mom marveled that she’d already “perfected the side-eye.” And Storms had “no idea where she got that from. None whatsoever.” Mm-hmm. In April of 2016, Harper helped Pop redefine procrastination. “If procrastinating means loving on this wee one,” he said, “I’ll take it.” A 2017 trip to the movies with her folks seemed to leave Harper unsure whether she was going to give the feature a thumbs-up or thumbs-down. Her “face, though,” laughed Mom. Hey, stuff happens when you get interrupted chowing down on popcorn. Harper was just 3 when Dad noticed that “someone likes being in the driver’s seat” and wondered if it was “a metaphor of developing personality traits.” If only you could bottle the joy in Harper’s expression in the pic Storms posted in April of 2018. “I’ve never seen someone so happy about bubbles,” she said. (Though now that we have, we’ll have to consider their potential for generating excitement… ) With Harper’s help, Barash’s Movie Quote Monday around her birthday in 2018 was particularly memorable. Bonus points to those of you who can name the flick to which they’re paying hilarious homage. In 2019, it was “Hello, kindergarten!” for Harper. “This kid blows my mind, like a brain-matter splatter,” exclaimed Barash in the spring of 2019. Play the video below to see why; the moppet’s got some deep thoughts. On Father’s Day 2020, Storms gave a shout-out to the ex with whom she coparents Harper, noting, “Your love for our kid is endless — I see it in the hugs you give each other when you’ve only been apart for a few days… ” And that was just for starters. In June of 2020, Harper’s folks got together for her commencement. “And although I appear constipated in this photo,” Barash noted, “I was elated.” Good to know! In April of 2021, Storms expressed a sentiment that ah, every parent has felt at one point or other, right? “OMG,” she captioned a cute pic with Harper, “I could just eat her face.” When Harper turned 7 in 2021, Barash couldn’t contain his admiration for his and Storms’ daughter. “This one’s got more ‘cool’ in her pinky finger than I’ll ever have in my whole body,” he remarked. “Which I just proved by putting quotes around the word cool.” In 2023, Harper gained a little brother when Dad and wife Isabella Devoto welcomed baby Joaquim. “Diggin’ the new look of our family photos,” smiled Barash. A year later, Storms marveled at the energy in the room — and, natch, the adorableness — as her real and reel lives collided. Sharing a pic of Harper at General Hospital with Gary James Fuller, who plays Maxie’s son James, Mom noted that “these two did not want to stop hanging out at work yesterday.” In the mood to see more photos of your favorite stars and their little ones?

Not only do dogs rely on their families for basic care and comfort, but they also thrive when given love, training, and routine. It's up to you to teach your dog how to navigate the world and to continue supporting and loving them throughout their lives. New mom Elissa knows exactly what it's like to raise both dogs and babies now that her daughter is born, but some of the most precious moments have happened when her Poodles and baby are together. On December 24, she posted a video showing just how special the bond between her daughter and one of her Poodles truly is. The 'terrified rescue dog' is usually afraid of anything unfamiliar, but the moment he asks the baby girl for love has people reaching for the tissues. This is the sweetest thing! The tiny dog seems as if he's building up the courage to interact with the baby at first, but he immediately relaxes as soon as he touches her. It's like he knows that she's just a gentle, happy little girl! Related: Moment Rescue Dog Finally Warms Up to Baby Human Sibling Is So Beautiful As the top commenter shared, the Miniature Poodle reaches out to the baby as if to say, ""You're a baby? I'm a baby, too!"" This would certainly explain why he's so comfortable with her. It's widely believed that dogs can detect hormonal changes in humans that are related to aging, so it's not out of the question to assume he knows her relative age. While the pup's gentle paw and brave gesture steal the show, it's also worth noting that the baby girl's gentleness is just as impressive. Clearly, Elissa is showing her daughter the right ways to interact with dogs! Before long, she'll be growing up to play with him, walk him, and adore him just as much as her mom does. Rescue dogs like this curly-coated cutie can take more time to build comfort and confidence in new situations—and that's perfectly fine! These pups have been through a lot, but showing them love and patience is the best thing you can do to help them blossom into the best dog they can be. Make sure to gently expose dogs to new situations using baby steps and lots of positive reinforcement. Meeting with a professional dog trainer can help you figure out the best ways to do this without causing your pup too much stress, and your four-legged friend will feel like their best self before you know it.

A manhunt was launched for the perpetrators of the shooting on Saturday night in the city of Villahermosa, in Tabasco state, the secretariat of security and civilian protection said in a statement. ""Five people lost their lives and seven were injured,"" it said. ""Analysis of video surveillance cameras is being carried out and elements of the state and federal authorities have deployed coordinated patrols to locate and arrest those responsible,"" it added. The death toll initially stood at five, but the Tabasco public prosecutor's office later said two more people had died in the attack on what it described as ""a clandestine bar that operated irregularly."" According to local media, unidentified gunmen burst into the bar La Casita Azul and opened fire at customers, leaving bloodied bodies strewn on the floor. Tabasco, home to oil production facilities, has seen an increase in violent crime in recent months. Just last month, seven inmates were killed in a prison riot in Tabasco. In November, six people were killed and 10 wounded in another armed attack on a bar in Villahermosa. That incident came two weeks after an attack on a bar left 10 dead in the city of Queretaro, in a central region that until now had been spared from violence linked to organized crime. The same weekend, six people were killed in a shooting in a bar in a suburb of Mexico City. In December, eight people were killed after gunmen pulled up to a roadside stand in north-central Mexico and opened fire on customers and bystanders. Drug-related violence has seen more than 450,000 people killed in Mexico since the government deployed the army to combat trafficking in 2006, according to official figures. Gang-related violence has continued unabated after Mexico's new president Claudia Sheinbaum took office on October 1. She has ruled out declaring war on the cartels and instead proposed a strategy she described as being based on gathering intelligence to sap their operational capacity. Sheinbaum also wants to carry on with her predecessor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's policy of attacking crime at its roots, with investment in social spending and crime prevention.

The last national day of mourning was in December 2018 to honor former President George H. W. Bush. To honor Carter, a Nobel Peace Prize recipient who was stationed for several years in Connecticut at Naval Submarine Base New London, all federal offices will be closed on Jan. 9 in observance of the day of mourning. While various other organizations may choose to also close in honor of Carter, unlike on a federal holiday, businesses are not required to close. So what exactly will be open and closed in Connecticut on Jan. 9, 2025? Here's what to know. All federal agencies and departments will be closed on Jan. 9, following an executive order for the one-day closure by President Biden. Following Biden's executive order, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts ordered the Supreme Court building closed on Jan. 9 in recognition of the nation's day of mourning. Trading on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq will be closed Jan. 9.

Here are the best beans and how to enjoy them.",Edwina Clark,2025-01-06T10:00:13.000Z,"If you’re looking to upgrade your health in 2025, eating more beans and lentils should be on your bingo card. Packed with nutrients such as fiber, protein, iron and magnesium, beans and lentils are among the most nutritious and versatile foods on the planet. Yet these little wonders are often overlooked at the supermarket. Maybe it’s because they often come in a can or that they got a bad rap in the ’90s as the “musical fruit,” but beans and lentils have flown under the radar for decades, while other superfoods like kale, chia and cauliflower have had their moments. However, it looks like beans are finally going to get the spotlight they deserve in 2025. Earlier last month, the Scientific Report of the 2025 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee was released, with recommendations for changes to dietary guidelines, including eating more beans and lentils. In its report, the committee noted that 83% of people fall short of the recommended 1 to 4 cups of cooked beans, peas and lentils per day. With National Bean Day approaching on Jan. 6, there’s never been a better time to embrace beans and lentils. Here’s why beans and lentils should be in your shopping cart more often: Beans and lentils offer a bouquet of nutrients, including protein, fiber, iron, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, folate, zinc and selenium, although the exact nutrition composition varies by type. They contain very little saturated fat and minimal sodium and have a low glycemic index. Studies show that eating beans is associated with a variety of health benefits, including: Heart health: Consuming beans may help lower LDL (bad) cholesterol and protect against heart disease. Colorectal cancer prevention: Eating beans may help protect against colorectal cancer. Blood glucose control: Despite their carbohydrate content, eating beans can help protect against diabetes and assist with blood glucose control. Weight management: People who eat beans regularly tend to weigh less and have better waist-to-hip ratio measurements compared to those who do not eat them. Better diet quality: Those who consume beans tend to have higher diet quality scores and consume more fiber, iron, calcium and potassium than those who don’t. From black beans to chickpeas, each bean variety comes with subtle differences in nutrient composition and taste. Arguably, the best beans are the ones you enjoy and are most motivated to eat, but here are five options that offer a particularly impressive range of nutrients: Lentils: Half a cup of boiled lentils provides 8g of fiber, 9g of protein and several micronutrients, including B vitamins, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, copper and manganese. How to enjoy them: Lentils can be added to salads and soups, used as a base for curries, transformed into burgers and used as a substitute for meat in Bolognese sauce. Black beans: Half a cup of canned black beans offers 6g each of fiber and protein, as well as various micronutrients such as iron, magnesium, manganese, folate and thiamine. How to enjoy them: Black beans are highly versatile and can be tossed into salads, added to taco bowls, mashed into baked goods, turned into burgers or stuffed into quesadillas. Cannellini beans: Half a cup of canned cannellini beans provides 5g of fiber, 6g of protein and 15% of the daily value for iron. How to enjoy them: Cannellini beans are fantastic in soups like minestrone and pasta fagioli because they hold their shape when cooked. They also can be whipped up into a dip in the food processor with olive oil, lemon juice, garlic and herbs, and served as an alternative to hummus. Chickpeas: A single half-cup serving provides 6g of fiber and 7.5g of protein and is a good source of iron, magnesium, phosphorus, folate, copper and manganese. How to enjoy them: Canned chickpeas are incredibly versatile and can be tossed onto a salad, mashed and added to a sandwich, whipped up into hummus in the food processor or even roasted and drizzled with chocolate for a sweet treat. Edamame: With 11g of protein per half cup, edamame are particularly protein-rich beans. They also offer 4g of fiber and more than 10% of the daily recommended intake for folate, vitamin K, iron, magnesium and phosphorus per half-cup serving. Edamame also contain isoflavones, a group of phytonutrients that may help alleviate menopausal symptoms such as night sweats and hot flashes. How to enjoy them: Edamame can be eaten on their own for a high-protein snack, tossed into a stir-fry or thrown on top of a rice bowl. They’re a little hardier than other beans, making them a great substitute for animal protein in numerous meals. Ready to eat more beans? Dried, canned and frozen beans can all be healthy options. Look for products without added sauces and salt. If you’re using canned, make sure it says “BPA-free” on the label. BPA (bisphenol A) is an endocrine disruptor and has been linked with a variety of health issues. Most cans no longer contain BPA; however, it doesn’t hurt to double-check. Beans and lentils are underrated, affordable and versatile sources of nutrition. They offer a surprising array of widely underconsumed nutrients such as fiber, iron, calcium and potassium, and eating them on a regular basis has been linked with a variety of health benefits.",448,[],2025-01-06 14:06:40,2025-01-07 01:15:11

It was a night of huge wins, expected and unexpected, with a brand-new host and plenty of unforgettable outfits. Stars like Timothée Chalamet, Melissa McCarthy, Dakota Fanning, Zendaya and Elton John all brought their A-game. Vin Diesel even greeted Dwayne Johnson. Here are the key takeaways from the ceremony. After racking up 10 nominations, it was clear the Golden Globes were fond of Netflix’s unconventional Spanish-language musical crime drama — and its four wins, including Best Motion Picture — Musical or Comedy, showed that. My colleague Taryn Ryder reported that the audience inside the Beverly Hilton was especially enthusiastic about the film. The Brutalist went into the ceremony with seven nominations and emerged with three wins, including Best Motion Picture — Drama. It’s also unconventional in its sheer length — 3 hours and 35 minutes, with a rare intermission. Both movies were well-received at film festivals throughout the year, and after the first major awards show of the season, they’re the ones to beat for future accolades. If you caught the 2024 Emmy Awards in September, you already know most of the television award winners at the Golden Globes. Hacks, Baby Reindeer and Shōgun all took home top awards in their categories in both ceremonies. Many of the acting awards went to the same people, too, like Anna Sawai, Hiroyuki Sanada, Jodie Foster, Jessica Gunning, Jeremy Allen White and Jean Smart. The way awards are categorized between ceremonies varies slightly, because the Emmys have time for more winners, since they focus solely on TV. For example, at the Golden Globes, Jessica Gunning won for Best Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role on Television, which encompasses all genres. At the Emmys, she won Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie. Both awards were for the same supporting role in the limited series Baby Reindeer. One major divergence between ceremonies was Colin Farrell's Golden Globe win for Best Performance by a Male Actor in a Limited Series, Anthology Series or a Motion Picture Made for Television. He starred in The Penguin, which didn't air in time to make the cut for the 2024 Emmys. Since it’s the first major awards show ahead of the Oscars, the actors who took home trophies came as a surprise to many. Zoe Saldaña, Kieran Culkin, Demi Moore, Fernanda Torres and Adrien Brody are all now frontrunners. They delivered emotional speeches — although Culkin’s prevailing emotion was humor. There were a few snubs of note, as well. Angelina Jolie was expected to win Best Performance by a Female Actor in a Motion Picture — Drama, but the trophy went to Fernanda Torres. The critical darling Anora was shut out entirely, and the ever-popular Wicked won one award for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement. The Wild Robot was expected to win Best Motion Picture — Animated but lost to the dialogue-free Latvian film Flow. From her hilarious monologue to her series of impressive outfit changes, Nikki Glaser is earning rave reviews for her performance as the host of the ceremony. She got Adam Sandler to join in as she did an impression of him, parodied Wicked and Conclave with a brief rendition of a song called “Pope-ular,” and roasted celebrity culture to the delight of audience members and the internet. It’s a famously tough gig, but the consensus seems to be that she nailed it.",2.7k,[],2025-01-06 14:06:40,2025-01-07 01:19:40

It's the most common learning disability in the world.,,Celebrity,Yahoo Life,,"The star of ""Emilia Perez"" has opened up about the challenges she faces in her job as a result of her learning disorder.",Kerry JustichReporter,2025-01-06T04:41:49.000Z,"Zoe Saldaña tearfully accepted the award for Best Supporting Actress in Any Motion Picture at the Golden Globes on Sunday. Onstage at the Beverly Hilton hotel in Los Angeles, the star of Emilia Perez opened up her speech with a warning and the admission: “I know I don’t have much time. And I have dyslexia, so I tend to forget, when I’m really anxious and I’m filled with adrenaline.” The reference to the learning disorder was brief, but it wasn’t the first time that Saldaña has spoken of it. She has told Variety that for a while, she was scared to take on certain jobs because of it. “The challenges that I’ve had, they have to do with my learning abilities,” she told the publication. “I have dyslexia and anxiety, which prevented me from really going after roles — a whole lot of roles — that I know I could have done.” She felt more comfortable sticking to films like Guardians of the Galaxy, Avengers and Star Trek and all of their sequels, so as not to put herself in a situation where her dyslexia would be tested. Joining the cast of Special Ops: Lioness, the Paramount+ show in which she plays alongside Nicole Kidman, was particularly scary for her, because she anticipated it would involve big monologues. Saldaña said that she requested her scripts weeks in advance and hired a line reader to work with her daily when she accepted the role. “I would memorize, memorize, memorize, and by the time that scene would come, it was an extension of who I was — like ballet,” she said. “The worst thing that [the writer Taylor Sheridan] can do is to change a scene last minute or add dialogue. That’s when I’m like, ‘Wait, wait, wait, that’s dyslexia 2.0’ — that will be the next step.” Dyslexia is a learning disability that disrupts how the brain processes written language, according to Cleveland Clinic, and, as the most common learning disability in the world, represents between 80% and 90% of all learning disabilities. It makes reading and language-related tasks like writing, spelling, memorizing words and forming sentences difficult. There are various ways that dyslexia can present, and it often emerges during childhood. Diagnosis requires careful evaluation and testing by a professional. However, experts estimate that although it affects up to 20% of people worldwide, only a fraction of them receive a proper diagnosis. There isn’t a cure for dyslexia, but educational interventions can make living with it easier. Saldaña’s one-on-one assistance learning scripts, for example, helps her to overcome reading-related challenges. Finding the right support is especially important for children of school age, whom the star addressed in a 2021 PSA for Child Mind Institute, where she spoke to the difficulty she experienced in her own education because of dyslexia and ADHD. Saldaña’s message about living with dyslexia and learning disorders offers hope. Fans agree that despite all the challenges, she hopes to encourage others not to be deterred from achieving their dreams. “[I’m] acknowledging that I’m scared, that I don’t want to stop growing, that I have so much more to learn. And that I want to work with many more filmmakers and do many more roles, different than the ones that I’ve done before,” she told Variety. “There’s something that comes with maturity — which is wisdom. And wisdom sometimes means just being honest with yourself.”",25,[],2025-01-06 14:06:40,2025-01-06 23:48:10

Biden's White House meeting with Edmundo González, who represented Venezuela’s main opposition coalition in the July presidential election, took place as the retired diplomat tries to rally support for his effort to get Maduro out of office by Friday, when by law, the South American country's next presidential term begins. Biden and González agreed that González's “campaign victory should be honored through a peaceful transfer back to democratic rule,” according to a White House readout of the meeting. Both men also expressed serious concerns regarding ""Maduro and his representatives’ unacceptable and indiscriminate use of repression against peaceful protestors, democracy activists, and civil society.” González began a tour of the Americas on Saturday with stops in Argentina and Uruguay. His campaign called on Venezuelans living in the Washington area to gather with him Monday outside the offices of the Organization of American States. Carolina di Martino Popovich waved and cheered in freezing temperatures outside the OAS, accompanied by her daughters Isabella, 1 and Camila, 6, and her mother Petra Gambor. Di Martino Popovich and Gambor are longtime immigrants from Venezuela. “We drove 10 hours in the snowstorm from Boston, and we made it,” di Martino Popovich said. “That is how much he means to us. We couldn’t vote in Venezuela, but we are here to recognize him as our president.” Meanwhile, Maduro already has received an invitation from the National Assembly to be sworn in for a third six-year term Friday, more than five months after the National Electoral Council, stacked with ruling-party loyalists, declared him winner of the July 28 election. More than 2,000 people, including minors, were arrested during nationwide post-election demonstrations. Opposition leaders, lawyers, activists and journalists were among those detained. Unlike previous presidential elections, electoral authorities did not provide detailed vote counts. However, the opposition collected tally sheets from more than 80% of the nation’s electronic voting machines, posted them online and said they showed González had won the election with twice as many votes as Maduro. The U.S.-based Carter Center, which Maduro’s government invited to observe the presidential election, has said the tally sheets published by the opposition are legitimate. The U.S. and most European governments have rejected the election’s official results and consider González the legitimate winner. “We had a long, fruitful and cordial conversation with President Biden and his team,” González told reporters. “We, of course, thanked the United States government for the support it has given us in this fight for democratic recovery in Venezuela. That is a commitment that we take with us and that we will continue to follow until the last day of the president’s government.” When asked on Monday about González's plans, Venezuela's Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello insulted the politician, attacked his credibility and threatened him with arrest. He also insisted that Maduro would be sworn in Friday. “Coward,” Cabello said, referring to the retired diplomat, whom he accused, without offering any proof, of being a CIA agent. “He has neither courage nor disposition... Mr. González Urrutia knows that as soon as he steps in Venezuela he will be arrested.” González, who represented the Unitary Platform coalition, left Venezuela for exile in Spain in September after a judge issued a warrant for his arrest in connection with an investigation into the publishing of the election's tally sheets. Last week, the government announced a $100,000 reward for information on González's whereabouts. González on Monday also told reporters his campaign has been in contact with the team of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. In recent weeks, González has vowed to travel to Venezuela to be sworn in for the presidential term, but he has not explained how he plans to return or wrest power from Maduro, whose party controls all institutions and the military. On Sunday, González addressed Venezuela's armed forces in a social media video, reminding them that according to the constitution, he “must assume the role of commander in chief” on Friday and that they are ""called to be a guarantee of sovereignty and respect for the popular will.” But Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino on Monday said the armed forces will recognize Maduro as president on Inauguration Day. “We categorically and with absolute vehemence reject this clownish and buffoonish act of despicable politicking, which will not have the slightest impact on the robust patriotic conscience of the (Venezuelan armed forces),” Padrino said in an address to the nation on state television. ——— Miller reported from Washington.

Last month, Trump visited Paris for the grand reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral, an event that underscored the enduring ties between France and the United States. “If we decide to be weak and defeatist, there is little chance we will be respected by the United States under President Trump,” Macron warned. The speech, delivered against a backdrop of geopolitical turmoil, laid out France’s foreign policy priorities, spanning the Ukraine war, European defense, and the Middle East. Even as Macron expressed openness to Trump, he delivered pointed criticism of tech mogul Elon Musk, a known Trump ally, for promoting what he described as a “new reactionary international” movement through his social media platform, X. Without naming Musk directly, Macron referenced his alleged support for Germany’s far-right AfD party and his increasing interference in European elections. “Who could have imagined, 10 years ago, that the owner of one of the world’s largest social networks would intervene directly in elections, including in Germany?” Macron said. He warned of the risks posed by unchecked power in the hands of tech billionaires and the destabilizing impact they could have on democratic institutions. Macron framed Musk’s influence as a challenge to Europe’s democratic values, reinforcing the need for European unity and resilience against external disruptions. Call for realism and responsibility on Ukraine Addressing the grinding war in Ukraine, Macron stressed the need for “realistic discussions on territorial questions,” adding, “such negotiations can only be conducted by Ukrainians themselves.” He called on the United States to “help change the nature of the situation and convince Russia to come to the negotiating table,” while underscoring Europe’s pivotal role. “The Europeans will have to construct security guarantees for Ukraine, which will be primarily their responsibility,” he said. Macron countered Trump’s campaign pledge for an express settlement, warning, “There is no quick and easy solution in Ukraine.” He also highlighted the stakes for the United States, stating, “The new American president himself knows the United States has no chance of winning anything if Ukraine loses.” The French president further cautioned against compromise due to fatigue. “The credibility of the West will be shattered if we compromise because of fatigue,” he asserted, adding that a capitulation of Ukraine would be catastrophic—not just for Europe, but for U.S. credibility as well. Fight against terrorism is a ‘central’ priority Macron addressed a range of pressing international issues, identifying Iran as the “principal strategic and security challenge” in the Middle East. He pointed to Tehran’s accelerated nuclear program as a looming global threat, warning that the world is “perilously close to the breaking point.” On Syria, Macron reiterated France’s long-term commitment to supporting a democratic transition, pledging to remain faithful to Kurdish fighters battling terrorism. “The fight against terrorism must remain central to our priorities,” he said, reaffirming France’s backing for allies like the Kurds while advocating for a “sovereign, pluralistic Syria.” Europe’s defense and economic future In a sharp critique of Europe’s dependence on U.S. defense technology, Macron urged European nations to bolster their industrial capabilities. “If we depend on the American industrial base for our security, we will face strategic dilemmas that are both cruel and culpable,” he warned. Macron also addressed the EU-Mercosur trade deal that France continues to oppose, signaling his country's intent to push for coherent commitments. The proposed agreement, which aims to reduce tariffs and boost trade between the European Union and South American countries, has been criticized for its potential environmental and agricultural impacts. “The mass is not said. We will continue to defend the coherence of our commitments,” Macron stated. Macron’s remarks underscored France’s delicate balancing act on the global stage—collaborating with old allies while maintaining European sovereignty.",83,[],2025-01-06 14:10:21,2025-01-07 00:19:42

Reilly,2025-01-06T21:00:08.000Z,"WASHINGTON — Four years after supporters of Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol in support of his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss, members of Congress were under heavy security Monday as they certified Trump's 2024 election victory, ensuring the first president to face federal felony criminal charges will return to the White House in two weeks. On Jan. 20, Trump will walk through the Lower West Tunnel — the location of some of the worst violence of the attack on Jan. 6, 2021 — to take the oath of office as the 47th president of the United States. Trump, who himself faced four felony charges in connection with Jan. 6 and his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss, has vowed to pardon some untold number of Jan. 6 defendants when he takes office. But details of Trump's plans are uncertain even as the final days of President Joe Biden's term tick away. More than 1,580 defendants have been charged and about 1,270 have been convicted in a sprawling investigation that has resulted in more than 660 prison sentences, according to statistics released Monday by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia. Prison sentences have ranged from a few days behind bars to 22 years in federal prison, a sentence imposed on former Proud Boys chairman Enrique Tarrio after he was convicted of seditious conspiracy. Hundreds more Jan. 6 defendants have been sentenced to probation, most of whom were convicted of low-level offenses like unlawful parading. In September, the federal government declared the Electoral College certification a National Special Security Event, heightening the level of security at the Capitol. Though there were no major protests Monday, the government put severe security measures in place that will remain as law enforcement agencies deal with other upcoming events, including funeral events for former President Jimmy Carter and Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20. On Saturday morning, about 36 hours before a snowstorm hit Washington, workers at the Capitol were placing additional layers of high fencing around the Capitol grounds, including on the west front, which Trump supporters took over during the Capitol attack four years ago. Trump, like many of his fellow Republicans, underwent a massive shift in his rhetoric since the Jan. 6 attack, from calling the Capitol breach a ""heinous attack"" in 2021 to describing it as a ""day of love"" last year. The effort to rewrite the history of Jan. 6 has been aided by numerous conspiracy theories that Trump allies on Capitol Hill have propagated. The president-elect said on ""Meet the Press"" last month that Jan. 6 defendants were subject to “a very nasty system” and that he would be “acting very quickly” on Jan. 6 pardons. Trump has said there “may be some exceptions” to his Jan. 6 pardons “if somebody was radical, crazy,” but he did not rule out pardoning people who had admitted assaulting police officers. The Trump transition team has said pardons will be issued “case by case,” but Trump has said the “vast majority” of Jan. 6 defendants should not be in jail. The U.S. attorney's office said that just eight pretrial defendants remain in jail in Washington, while all the other incarcerated Jan. 6 defendants are serving the sentences imposed after their convictions. While more misdemeanor cases against low-level Jan. 6 defendants seem unlikely in a Trump administration, it is not yet clear how pending cases against people accused of assaulting law enforcement officers will be handled. Online “sedition hunters” who have already aided the FBI in hundreds of Jan. 6 cases say more than 200 people suspected of committing assaults on law enforcement officers or members of the media have been identified but have not yet been arrested. Among them are more than 60 people whose images are featured on the FBI website that lists them as wanted for assault. Biden implored lawmakers Sunday to speak truthfully about the Capitol attack, in which more than 140 police officers were injured and after which some law enforcement officers died, at an event with newly elected Democratic lawmakers. “Now, it’s your duty to tell the truth, to remember what happened and not let Jan. 6th be rewritten,” Biden said. “It’s one of the toughest days in American history.” This article was originally published on NBCNews.com",83,[],2025-01-06 14:10:21,2025-01-07 00:17:41
https://www.yahoo.com/news/congress-gathers-certify-donald-trumps-120000389.html,Congress gathers to certify Trump's win on the anniversary of the riot he inspired,,Politics,NBC News,4 min read,"Congress certified President-elect Donald Trump’s 2024 election victory, exactly four years after he stirred up a mob that attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",Sahil Kapur,2025-01-06T23:09:00.000Z,"WASHINGTON — Congress formally certified President-elect Donald Trump’s 2024 victory Monday, exactly four years after he stirred up a mob that attacked the U.S. Capitol in a failed attempt to disrupt the certification of his 2020 election loss and keep him in power. Vice President Kamala Harris oversaw the certification of her defeat, which went smoothly and without drama amid a citywide snow emergency declaration. “Democracy must be upheld by the people,” Harris told NBC News moments ahead of the certification. One by one, the designees counted the electoral votes of each state for the winning candidates. Vice President-elect JD Vance, currently a senator from Ohio, sat in the chamber and watched from the front row. Standing next to her at the lectern in the House chamber was Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., who in 2021 helped engineer the failed objections to certifying President Joe Biden’s victory. “Donald J. Trump of the state of Florida has received 312 votes,” Harris said after the votes were counted, pausing for applause. “Kamala D. Harris of the state of California has received 226 votes.” Four years ago, 147 Republicans voted to overturn the result and discount electors for Biden, even though Trump had failed to produce any evidence that the result was illegitimate. This time, Democrats chose not to respond in kind, instead seeking to return Jan. 6 to its historical roots as a boring and rote affair at which the president-elect is certified without drama. “Jan. 6th should be an unremarkable day. This is a day that the rest of America should never have to really think about it,” said newly minted Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J. “Just a pro forma certification of the election results. The fact that it is a day that still lingers in our consciousness kind of shows just how broken our politics are.” The top House Democrat made it clear Friday that Jan. 6, 2025, would be drama-free. “Two months ago, the American people elected Donald Trump as the 47th president of the United States of America,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said as Republicans clapped. “Thank you for that very generous applause. It’s OK. There are no election deniers on our side of the aisle. “One should love America when you win and when you lose,” Jeffries continued. “That’s the patriotic thing to do, and that’s the America that House Democrats will fight hard to preserve because we love this country. America is bigger than any one campaign, any one election or any one individual.” On Sunday, Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser declared a snow emergency. “We got a big snowstorm coming to D.C., and we encourage all of our colleagues: Do not leave town, stay here,” Johnson said Sunday on Fox News. “Because, as you know, the Electoral Count Act requires this on Jan. 6 at 1 p.m. So whether we’re in a blizzard or not, we’re going to be in that chamber making sure this is done.” The certification process does not require full attendance. Many House Republicans were present, having stayed in Washington over the weekend for a retreat. In late 2022, the Democratic-controlled Congress passed a law overhauling the certification process in a bid to prevent another Jan. 6, 2021-type event and make it harder for future presidential candidates to steal elections. Among the changes: The vice president’s role is clarified to eliminate any room for doubt that he or she cannot refuse to count Electoral College votes that the states have already certified. And the threshold for voting on an objection to counting certain electoral votes is up from just one House member and one senator to one-fifth of each chamber. The changes also include safeguards against injecting “fake electors” into the process. Unlike in 2021, when Trump invited his supporters to come to Washington for the certification on Jan. 6 and then urged them to “fight like hell” in a speech that morning, widespread protests were not expected this time around. Still, Capitol Police and the Secret Service raised temporary fencing around the Capitol for security, and the certification Monday was previously declared a “national special security event.” Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger said the fencing will remain up through Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/biden-bans-offshore-drilling-along-120007702.html,Biden bans new offshore drilling along most of the U.S. coastline,,Politics,NBC News,4 min read,The White House announced Monday that President Joe Biden would ban new offshore oil and gas drilling along most of the U.S. coastline.,David Hodari,2025-01-06T16:24:25.000Z,"The White House announced Monday that President Joe Biden would ban new offshore oil and gas drilling along most of the U.S. coastline. The order will protect some 625 million acres of ocean along America’s Atlantic and Pacific coasts, the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska’s Bering Sea from ""environmental and economic risks and harms,"" the White House said in a statement announcing the move. It is also an attempt to protect Biden’s climate legacy from the energy policy set to be pursued by Republicans and President-elect Donald Trump’s energy policy. Biden will use an obscure provision of the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), which gives the president the power to indefinitely withdraw unleased lands from the outer continental shelf. While former President Barack Obama used the act in 2016 to protect 119 million acres of land, Monday’s move is much larger and will be viewed as a significant victory for environmental groups that have long argued further drilling is contradictory to the U.S. government’s stated goal of slashing emissions that lead to climate change. Last year was the hottest in recorded history. “Drilling off these coasts could cause irreversible damage to places we hold dear and is unnecessary to meet our nation’s energy needs. It is not worth the risks,” Biden said in a statement. “As the climate crisis continues to threaten communities across the country and we are transitioning to a clean energy economy, now is the time to protect these coasts for our children and grandchildren,” he added. Biden's decision takes the total area of ocean he has protected to 670 million acres — higher than any other president — and could frustrate Trump's plans to gain an economic boost from doubling down on the increased oil and gas production he oversaw in his first administration. During his first administration, Trump used an executive order in an attempt to overturn Obama’s decision to invoke OCSLA during the final month of his presidency, but that decision was struck down in the courts. That means it may take an act of Congress to reverse Monday’s announcement by the Biden administration. The week after he won the 2024 presidential election, Trump named Liberty Energy CEO Chris Wright as his pick to lead the Department of Energy. Wright has previously written on the need for more fossil fuel production to lift people out of poverty, and in a video posted to his LinkedIn profile in 2023, said that “there is no climate crisis, and we’re not in the midst of an energy transition, either.” While many of the protected areas have not tended to draw much interest from the energy industry, the Biden administration also said the ban would cover the entire eastern U.S. Atlantic coast and the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Both areas have been of interest to oil companies, although Trump himself moved to prevent drilling in those areas during his first administration. In 2020, Trump issued a moratorium on drilling in areas where oil and gas exploration received wide opposition from Republicans in Florida and voters in North Carolina. In many of the areas protected by Monday’s announcement, Biden said, “development that would do little, if anything, to meet the nation’s energy needs.” Citing the lessons learned from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill — when 134 million gallons of oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico — Biden said that “we do not need to choose between protecting the environment and growing our economy, or between keeping our ocean healthy, our coastlines resilient, and the food they produce secure and keeping energy prices low. Those are false choices.” Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland said in a statement that “President Biden’s actions today are part of our work across this Administration to make bold and enduring changes that recognize the impact of oil and gas drilling on our nation’s coastlines.” “Today, the President is taking action that reflects what states, Tribes and local communities have shared with us — a strong and overwhelming need to support resilient oceans and coastlines by protecting them from unnecessary oil and gas development,” she added. The announcement received a jubilant reaction from environmental groups. “These protective policies will ensure safer conditions and more room for prosperity for millions of people living along American coasts, for thousands of businesses that rely on undisturbed oceans, and for vulnerable wildlife,” said Drew Caputo, a vice president at Earthjustice, which is a nonprofit dedicated to litigating environmental issues. “Our coastlines are home to millions of Americans and support billions of dollars of economic activity that depend on a clean coast, abundant wildlife, and thriving fisheries,” said Joseph Gordon, campaign director of ocean conservation nonprofit Oceana. “President Biden’s new protections add to this bipartisan history, including President Trump’s previous withdrawals in the southeastern United States in 2020.” This article was originally published on NBCNews.com",74,[],2025-01-06 14:10:21,2025-01-07 00:19:42

In a recorded video message about her role Monday, obtained first by NBC News, Harris says it is a “sacred obligation” that she will uphold, “guided by love of country, loyalty to our Constitution and my unwavering faith in the American people.” On Jan. 6, 2021, Trump held a rally in Washington, D.C., where he baselessly claimed that the election was stolen from him and urged his vice president, Mike Pence, not to certify the election results. Many of his supporters then marched to the Capitol and stormed the building. On that day, Harris, then the vice president-elect, was inside Democratic National Committee headquarters when a pipe bomb was discovered near a park bench outside the building. Capitol Police and the Secret Service evacuated her minutes later. Harris has accepted the 2024 results, and there are no large-scale Democratic protests planned in what is expected to be unseasonably cold weather with significant snowfall. The vice president said she believes she has a chance Monday to reiterate the democratic norms of the country, and she has made clear to those close to her and Democratic leaders that she plans to have a voice in politics after she leaves office, despite her loss to Trump, according to interviews with current and former Harris aides. “Today, at the United States Capitol, I will perform my constitutional duty as vice president of the United States to certify the results of the 2024 election,” Harris says in her new video message, adding, “As we have seen, our democracy can be fragile. And it is up to each of us to stand up for our most cherished principles.” The video aims to cement Harris’ steadfast belief that the vice president’s role in certifying election results is “solely ministerial,” while also reminding all Americans of the role they play in preserving our democracy, according to a White House official. The official added that Harris, in her concession speech following Election Day, made clear she would engage in a peaceful transition of power, and she has “consistently worked to do so in the weeks since.” “She feels that it’s important to uphold the standards and pillars of our democracy and make sure that people know that she doesn’t only support democracy when it is in her favor,” said one current senior Harris aide who spoke on condition of anonymity to candidly describe the vice president’s thinking. “She was very intentional that she didn’t want anything about this day to be about politics or her being the nominee. We took the execution of this duty for granted until it became a violent day in history. So, knowing that, she is clear-eyed. She wants to make sure that people know that this is what democracy looks like.” Still, a former longtime Harris aide who worked on her campaign said while Harris may not show it Monday, it will also be emotional for the vice president and many of her supporters. “There’s definitely sadness and frustration,” said the person who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly. “She believed she should have won the race, but the country didn’t want to go in that direction.” Another senior Harris aide reiterated that she will not let politics or disappointment get in the way of certifying votes. “The vice president understands that our democracy requires elected leaders who have taken the sacred oath of office and everyday citizens alike to actively preserve it,” the aide said. “It is with this deep sense of responsibility and duty in mind that the vice president will certify the presidential election on Jan. 6 and reaffirm the will of the American people.” A former Harris aide who has been spending time with her, including at holiday parties last month, also said Harris has been telling her allies, including her own family members, that they need to push forward. “Backstage at Howard, she was telling members of her own family that we’re not going to have any pity parties, that we have a lot to be proud of in the way that we waged the campaign, and telling people to carry themselves with pride,” the former Harris aide said. “And then she delivered that message in many of the holiday parties to current and former staff, to the campaign staff, to donors that were in attendance at those parties, to members of Congress and advocacy group leaders that were part of the guest list of some of those parties.” That former aide, as well as a current aide, also said it is “highly likely” that after leaving office, Harris will set up an organization to be able to travel, do speaking engagements and advocate for some of the issues she spoke about on the campaign trail. It wasn’t clear exactly what legal form such a group would take yet. The aides also said Harris has not decided what her next move will be. But former and current aides say Harris is open to considering a number of endeavors including running for president in 2028 or running for governor of California in 2026, noting a Black woman has never been elected governor of any state. Some have also suggested Harris become a professor or even host a cooking show, though it’s not clear Harris would be interested in any of those options. In the short term, after leaving office, Harris is expected to move back to California. “She’s still in a stage where she’s not made any decisions about exactly what remaining in the fight will look like, but she just overall resolves to remain in the fight,” the former aide who attended the holiday parties said. “I don’t think she’s ruled anything in or out on that.” This article was originally published on NBCNews.com",596,[],2025-01-06 14:10:21,2025-01-07 00:19:42

The claim, which drew no response from Ukrainian authorities, came a day after the Russian Defense Ministry said Ukrainian forces had pressed new attacks in Russia’s Kursk border region. The inauguration in two weeks’ time of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has brought a new element of uncertainty and triggered an apparent effort by both sides to establish battlefield gains before any possible peace talks. See for yourself — The Yodel is the go-to source for daily news, entertainment and feel-good stories. By signing up, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Policy. Trump hasn’t detailed his plans for accomplishing his goal of ending the fighting, but his presence in the White House is likely to significantly affect how the war plays out. Kurakhove is a key stronghold for the Ukrainian army on the eastern front line in the partially occupied Donetsk region. It has an industrial zone, a thermal power plant and a reservoir. It sits on a highway between eastern and southern Ukraine. In November, The Associated Press reported from the town that some 7,000-10,000 people likely remained in Kurakhove. Its prewar population was about twice that. The town has been under relentless attacks from artillery, multiple rocket launchers, powerful guided bombs and drones that have shattered buildings. Ukrainian officials usually comment on major battlefield defeats only days after Russia announces them. Michael Kofman of the Carnegie Endowment said in an assessment published on the social platform X that there has been some cheering news for Ukraine. “Ukraine is grinding down Russian forces. Russian gains are small relative to costs. There has been no collapse of the front,” Kofman wrote. On the other hand, he said, “Ukraine is losing territory. The coldest part of the winter is yet ahead. The current theory of success is unclear, or what resources will be made available by the West in 2025.” Russia has this year been driving westward in a slow and costly effort to capture all of Donetsk. Ukraine is short of troops on the front lines and is straining to hold back the bigger Russian army. Russian forces are trying to close in on nearby Pokrovsk, a key road junction and rail distribution center furnishing supplies to a broad span of the Ukrainian front line. In 2022, Moscow illegally annexed the Donetsk and neighboring Luhansk regions, which make up the Donbas industrial area, together with southeastern provinces of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. But Russian forces don’t fully control any of them. Ukraine is keen to get new Western military aid delivered quickly, and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday he hoped more would be pledged later this week at a meeting with Western partners in Germany. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Sunday that Ukraine launched a fresh offensive in the Kursk region, where military analysts estimate Kyiv recently lost 40% of what its forces captured in a lightning insurgency five months ago. Russian officials claimed their forces pushed back the Ukrainian push, but some reports from Russian military bloggers indicated that Moscow’s forces faced significant pressure. The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank that monitors the conflict, said Ukrainian forces on Sunday resumed offensive operations in at least three areas of Kursk and made tactical advances. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",94,[],2025-01-06 14:10:21,2025-01-06 14:10:21

González, who claimed to have won the July 28 election, left Venezuela for exile in Spain in September after a judge issued a warrant for his arrest. Taking the oath of office will allow Maduro to cement a mishmash of policies that allowed the government to end the scarcities and runaway inflation that dominated most of his 11 years in office. Those measures, however, no longer fulfill his and his predecessor’s self-proclaimed socialist promises and continue to strip Venezuela of its democracy. González has said he intends to be in Caracas on Friday, but he has not explained how he intends to do so or what his plans are upon arrival. Here’s what to know about Venezuela’s next presidential term: Why are there doubts about who should be sworn in as president? The doubts stem from the government’s lack of transparency in handling and announcing the results of the presidential election. Venezuela’s National Electoral Council, stacked with ruling-party loyalists, declared Maduro the winner hours after polls closed. However, unlike previous presidential elections, electoral authorities did not provide detailed vote counts, alleging that a website hack prevented them from doing so. Yet, the opposition collected tally sheets from 80% of the nation’s electronic voting machines, posted them online and said the detailed vote records showed González won the election with twice as many votes as Maduro. Global condemnation over the lack of transparency prompted Maduro to ask the country’s high court, also filled with allies of the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela, to audit the election results. The court, without showing thorough evidence, subsequently reaffirmed Maduro’s victory and encouraged the electoral council to release the vote counts. But electoral authorities never did and neither did the ruling party, whose voting center representatives — just like the opposition’s — were entitled to tally sheets from every voting machine. The U.S.-based Carter Center, which Maduro’s government invited to observe the presidential election, has said the tally sheets published by the opposition are legitimate. Will people demonstrate in favor or against Maduro? The government frequently schedules demonstrations, particularly when it wants to show strength in numbers, such as on Friday. Maduro has called on Venezuelans to head to the streets that day, but not everyone marching with a pro-ruling-party shirt supports him. The government often coerces public employees and state-benefits recipients into participating in demonstrations. Whether people will protest against Maduro on Friday remains to be seen since the government’s post-election repression campaign, including the arrests of more than 2,000 people, has had a chilling effect. And even if opposition supporters decide to demonstrate, it is unclear who would lead them. On Sunday, opposition stalwart Maria Corina Machado urged supporters to demonstrate on Thursday across the country to push Maduro out of office. “Maduro is not going to leave on his own, we must make him leave with the strength of a population that never gives up,” Machado said in a social media video. “Go outside, shout, fight. It is time to stand firm, and make them understand that this is as far as they go. That this is over.” Machado, who has been hiding for months at an undisclosed location to avoid arrest, told supporters she “will be with” them Thursday. Meanwhile, González remains away from Venezuela and opposition leaders who often accompanied him and Machado to campaign rallies were jailed after the election. Who will attend the swearing-in ceremony? Members of the National Assembly, ministers and Maduro’s close allies within Venezuela are expected to attend. The government’s centralized public information office did not immediately respond to a request from The Associated Press for a list of the heads of state who have confirmed their attendance. But the list could be in the single digits since the country’s post-election crisis has further isolated Maduro. Maduro has faced criticism for the election’s lack of transparency from dozens of countries, including neighboring Colombia and Brazil, whose leaders had been friendly toward him in practically all other matters. They even attempted to broker a peacemaking deal between his government and the opposition after the July vote. Neither country’s president will attend Friday’s ceremony and will instead send representatives. Maduro’s last inauguration, in 2019, was attended by Cuba’s President Miguel Diaz-Canel and then-Bolivian President Evo Morales. What is expected of Maduro’s next term? The food shortages and four-digit inflation that characterized most of Maduro’s 11-year presidency are gone, but the country’s protracted crisis has no end in sight. These days, the average Venezuelan must cope with a monthly minimum wage of less than $2, soaring food prices, irregular fuel supply and a substandard public education system. But at the same time, a lucky few with ties to Maduro and his allies benefit from jobs and contracts that allow them to afford imported toilet paper that costs $70, import and sell vehicles, open made-for-Instagram restaurants, and offer luxury tourism experiences. That inequality is precisely the kind that was supposed to disappear under the policies that Maduro’s mentor and predecessor, the late President Hugo Chávez, described as socialism for the 21st century. It is expected to widen as the government continues to wrestle with an oil-dependent economy crippled by limited crude production, corruption, mismanagement, economic sanctions, firmly restricted credit access and a lack of private investment. Ahead of the election, voters across the country repeatedly said they or their loved ones would emigrate if Maduro remained in power. Under his watch, more than 7.7 million Venezuelans have already left their homeland in search of better living conditions.",16,[],2025-01-06 14:10:21,2025-01-07 00:19:42

In an opinion piece published Sunday in The Washington Post, Biden recalled Jan. 6, 2021, writing that “violent insurrectionists attacked the Capitol.” “We should be proud that our democracy withstood this assault,"" Biden wrote. ""And we should be glad we will not see such a shameful attack again this year.” Congress is convening in Washington on Monday to certify Trump's victory in November's election — in a session presided over by the candidate he defeated, Vice President Kamala Harris. No violence, or even procedural objections, are expected this time, marking a return to a U.S. tradition that launches the peaceful transfer of presidential power. That's despite Trump continuing to deny that he lost to Biden in 2020, already musing publicly about staying beyond the Constitution’s two-term White House limit, and promising to pardon some of the more than 1,250 people who have pleaded guilty or were convicted of crimes for the Capitol siege. In his opinion piece, Biden says of the certification process, ""After what we all witnessed on Jan. 6, 2021, we know we can never again take it for granted."" He doesn't mention Trump directly but says “an unrelenting effort has been underway to rewrite — even erase — the history of that day."" “To tell us we didn’t see what we all saw with our own eyes,” Biden wrote. “We cannot allow the truth to be lost.” He vowed that the “election will be certified peacefully. I have invited the incoming president to the White House on the morning of Jan. 20, and I will be present for his inauguration that afternoon,” even though Trump skipped Biden's inauguration in 2021. “But on this day, we cannot forget,” Biden added. “We should commit to remembering Jan. 6, 2021, every year. To remember it as a day when our democracy was put to the test and prevailed. To remember that democracy — even in America — is never guaranteed.” Trump, on Monday, didn't mention Biden's opinion piece but disputed the Democratic president's assertion that he's worked to ensure an orderly transfer of power from one administration to the next. “They talk about a transition. They’re always saying, ’Oh, no, we want to have a smooth transition from party to party of government,'"" Trump told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. ""Well, they’re making it really difficult. They’re throwing everything they can in the way.” Those comments came as Trump bristled at an 11th hour order issued Monday by Biden banning offshore oil and gas drilling in most federal waters, which the Republican president-elect vowed to roll back once he's in office. Biden's published opinion piece on Sunday evening followed him telling reporters at the White House earlier in the day that the history of what occurred on Jan. 6, 2021, “should not be rewritten” and adding, “I don’t think it should be forgotten."" Biden spent much of 2024 warning voters that Trump was a serious threat to the nation’s democracy. And this past week, the president awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal to Liz Cheney and Bennie Thompson, leaders of the congressional investigation into the Capitol riot. As he did with his opinion piece, Biden used his Sunday comments to reports to insist that he's overseeing a peaceful handover of power — and contrast that with Trump's actions in early 2021. ”I’ve reached out to make sure the smooth transition,"" Biden said of Trump's incoming administration. ""We’ve got to get back to basic, normal transfer of power."" Asked if he still viewed his soon-to-be successor in the White House as a threat to democracy, Biden responded, ""I think what he did was a genuine threat to democracy. I’m hopeful we’re beyond that now.”",2.9k,[],2025-01-06 14:10:21,2025-01-07 00:21:01

Altman said in a new interview the most helpful thing Trump can do for AI is invest in new infrastructure. He sided with Trump's opposition to bureaucratic blockades, saying it's ""difficult"" to build in the US. Sam Altman says he doesn't agree with President-elect Donald Trump on everything, but he does believe that the US has a problem with bureaucracy stifling innovation. In an interview with Bloomberg, the OpenAI CEO described his hopes for the AI landscape under the next Trump administration, which he said he believes should come with substantial investment in new, US-built infrastructure. ""The thing I really deeply agree with the president on is, it is wild how difficult it has become to build things in the United States,"" Altman said. ""Power plants, data centers, any of that kind of stuff. I understand how bureaucratic cruft builds up, but it's not helpful to the country in general."" He added: ""It's particularly not helpful when you think about what needs to happen for the US to lead AI. And the US really needs to lead AI."" Altman suggested that AI isn't the only industry where regulation is hindering infrastructure development. He added that it's a hurdle for the fusion power startup Helion, which he's invested in. In July, Helion received a license from the Washington State Department of Health, allowing the company to use radioactive byproduct materials to operate its fusion generator. ""Soon there will be a demonstration of net-gain fusion. You then have to build a system that doesn't break. You have to scale it up,"" Altman said. ""You have to figure out how to build a factory — build a lot of them — and you have to get regulatory approval. And that will take, you know, years altogether? Oklo, another Altman-backed nuclear power company, has yet to receive approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission after its previous application was denied in 2022, Tech Crunch reported. In addition to siding with Trump on a looser approach to regulation and infrastructure development, Altman also hedged his prior support of the CHIPS Act, a multibillion-dollar manufacturing incentive for semiconductor production pushed forward by President Joe Biden's administration. ""I think the CHIPS Act was better than doing nothing but not the thing that we should have done,"" Altman said. ""And I think there's a real opportunity to do something much better as a follow-on. I don't think the CHIPS Act has been as effective as any of us hoped."" The OpenAI chief reportedly wants to raise trillions of dollars to address the global chip shortage, and according to the Wall Street Journal, has held talks with international investors to raise the funds, including from the United Arab Emirates. Representatives for the Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. OpenAI declined to comment. Altman has donated $1 million of his personal funds to Trump's inauguration fund, saying in December that the President-elect ""will lead our country into the age of AI, and I am eager to support his efforts to ensure America stays ahead,"" Business Insider previously reported. He told Bloomberg he supports ""any president,"" adding that he believes ""AGI will probably get developed during this president's term, and getting that right seems really important."" ""Supporting the inauguration, I think that's a relatively small thing,"" Altman said. ""I don't view that as a big decision either way. But I do think we all should wish for the president's success."" As the second Trump administration is set to begin later this month, Altman isn't the only executive angling to help shape policy over the next four years with substantial donations to his office. BI previously reported companies including Meta, Amazon, Uber, Ford, and Toyota have donated $1 million each to Trump's inaugural fund.

The four-time MVP threw the 500th touchdown pass of his career on Sunday, finding tight end Tyler Conklin in the end zone after stepping up in the pocket. It was his 25th touchdown with the Jets after throwing 475 while with the Green Bay Packers. At 41 years old, Rodgers is the fifth quarterback in NFL history to throw 500 touchdown passes, joining Tom Brady (649), Drew Brees (571), Peyton Manning (539) and Brett Favre (508). The next closest is Philip Rivers with 421. Funnily enough, all six of those quarterbacks were selected as either starters or reserves in the 2010 Pro Bowl. Rodgers would go on to throw three more touchdown passes in a 32-20 win over the Miami Dolphins, finishing 23-of-36 for 274 yards, four touchdowns and an interception. It was the kind of performance the Jets were probably expecting when they first acquired him, but alas. Rodgers entered this game, the last of his second season in a Jets uniform, with his football future as cloudy as it's ever been. It's no secret his Jets tenure has been an outright disaster, with him missing nearly the entire first season with a torn Achilles tendon and leading the Jets to a 4-12 record entering Sunday this season. The Jets have Rodgers under contract for next season, but it's an open question if they cut him loose in some way. As Yahoo Sports' Charles Robinson has reported, Rodgers is quietly pushing for another season in New York, which has signed a number of players at his behest, while the Jets seem less enthusiastic.

The senior went to the locker room, but returned shortly thereafter wearing an ice pack on her left knee while sitting on the bench. She did not return to the game.

I feel good."" Auriemma added that he had a substitute ready to come in for Bueckers before she got hurt. Those who watch the NBA might have noted that the collision was similar to what happened on Wednesday when the Orlando Magic's Cole Anthony dove into the left leg of Detroit Pistons guard Jaden Ivey, who was taken off the court in a stretcher. Ivey sustained a broken fibula on the play. Bueckers not getting seriously hurt is certainly fortunate considering her reaction. That may have been based as much on her memory of injuring that left knee as much as whatever pain she was feeling. UConn hasn't provided an update since the game ended. Perhaps the program is waiting for further tests need to be performed. Or the lack of news means Bueckers is all right.

Steven Wise, 71, had been suffering with painful acid reflux for a year. After over the counter medication proved ineffective, the grandad-of-seven was eventually prescribed Lansoprazole - a strong acid reflux medication - but suffered an allergic reaction almost immediately after taking them. Steven, a tennis and football coach from Hampstead, London was rushed to hospital and given an adrenaline shot, endoscopy and a CT scan. But the results revealed he had a mass in his bowel, which was later diagnosed as stage 3 bowel cancer. Just three weeks after his diagnosis, in September 2023, Steven had surgery to remove the 7cm lump from his colon, with doctors describing the procedure as a complete success. ""If it wasn’t for that tablet reaction I’d never have known I had cancer - it’s given me a second chance to live life to the fullest,"" he says. Steven was initially rushed to the Royal Free Hospital, in London, in September 2023, after the reaction to the reflux tablet proved so severe he feared he might die. ""My body didn’t take well to it at all, and I totally panicked,"" he recalls. ""Within a week, they called me back to say that they had actually found stage 3 cancer in my bowel. I was in complete shock as I hadn’t had any symptoms."" Following his operation Steven's immediate treatment plan included chemotherapy, in tablet form as a precaution to prevent the cancer from returning. But after a few weeks, he had to discontinue them due to him experiencing side effects like swelling and exhaustion. Thankfully, despite stopping the chemo, his recovery has continued smoothly, and Steven recently received the all-clear for cancer. The news came almost exactly a year after his surgery, when his latest colonoscopy showed no signs of cancer. He is now undergoing a five-year follow-up programme, and feels thankful to the medical team at the Royal Free, who he says went above and beyond to support him on his cancer journey. ""They were incredible,"" he says of the medical staff. ""The doctors originally warned me I might need a stoma bag, but I asked them if there was any way around it. The surgeon even re-stitched me just so he could prevent me having a stoma bag."" Steven says he also feels grateful he had a reaction to acid reflux medication as he only underwent further testing because of that. ""Without that scan, it [the cancer] would have gone to stage 4 and I would have almost certainly died,"" he says. ""Other than the reflux I felt fine,"" he continues. ""It just shows."" Being told he is now cancer-free has also enabled Steven to get back to enjoying his busy lifestyle and he says he has no plans on giving up his coaching career just yet. ""I was always told the chair is the enemy,"" he explains. ""You’ve got to keep doing stuff and keep active. I’m kept busy with my grandchildren and life is good. I’m out playing golf again and truly grateful to be here."" Last year Dr James Kinross, Colorectal Surgeon at King Edward VII’s Hospital shared six potential warning signs of bowel cancer to look out for including: A change in toilet habits - If you notice you need to poo more often than normal or you have looser, runnier stools, this could be a sign to head to your GP. Blood in your stools - ""If you’re noticing blood in your stools, and you don’t suffer from haemorrhoids, it may be a warning sign that something isn’t quite right,"" Dr Kinross says.\ Stomach or abdominal pain - Dr Kinross says any persistent abdominal pain, from cramps to discomfort, particularly if it's accompanied by bloating, could be a sign of bowel cancer. Unexplained weight loss - ""Losing weight unintentionally, without changes in diet or exercise habits, could be a sign of various underlying health issues, including bowel cancer,"" Dr Kinross says. A pain or lump in your stomach or back - While a pain or lump in your stomach or back passage is likely to be benign, Dr Kinross says it may indicate a malignant growth so it is worth getting checked. Ongoing fatigue or weakness - ""Persistent fatigue or weakness that doesn't improve with rest could be a symptom of bowel cancer, especially if it's accompanied by other symptoms such as abdominal pain or unexplained weight loss,"" Dr Kinross says.

Sunday concluded the 2024 NFL regular season, which featured one of the closest MVP races in recent memory, a host of rare statistical milestones and a historic finish last night in Detroit. The playoffs are set: The final two postseason spots were decided on Sunday, as the Buccaneers clinched the NFC South and the Broncos finally snapped their eight-year playoff drought. NFC: The Lions clinched the NFC's top seed for the first time ever with a 31-9 blowout win over the Vikings — the first season finale since 1993 in which the winner earned the No. 1 seed, and the first regular-season game in NFL history between 14-win teams. AFC: The path to the Super Bowl still runs through Kansas City. The Chiefs are seeking their third straight title after earning the No. 1 seed for the fourth time in seven seasons with Patrick Mahomes under center. Title odds: The Lions are the favorites to hoist the Lombardi Trophy (+280 at BetMGM), followed by the Chiefs (+350), Ravens (+600), Bills (+600), Eagles (+700), Vikings (+1600), Packers (+1800), Buccaneers (+3000), Chargers (+3500), Rams (+3500), Commanders (+3500), Broncos (+8000), Texans (+8000) and Steelers (+10000). An MVP race for the ages: For weeks, it looked like Josh Allen would run away with the award, but Lamar Jackson has not so quietly made a bid for his third MVP after leading the Ravens (12-5) to just one fewer win than Allen's Bills (13-4). Jackson: Baltimore's dual threat QB is not only the first player with at least 4,000 passing (4,172) and 900 rushing yards (915) in a season, but also the first with 40+ TD (41) and fewer than five INT (4). He added four rushing TDs and posted a career-high 119.6 passer rating. Allen: Buffalo's signal-caller sat Sunday's game, ending the year with 3,731 yards, 28 TD and 6 INT, plus 531 rushing yards and 12 scores on the ground. While Jackson has better numbers, it's important to note that Allen sat roughly 11 quarters this season with the game (or playoff spot) already in hand. Honorable mention: Saquon Barkley, who also rested on Sunday, became the ninth member of the 2,000 yard club; Joe Burrow led the league in passing yards (4,918) and TD (43). Season in review: Rodgers' last stand? Aaron Rodgers' future, as both a Jet and in the NFL, is up in the air. If Sunday was his swan song it was quite a coda: He posted his first 4 TD game since 2021 and became the fifth QB in NFL history with 500 career TD passes. Rookie standouts: Jayden Daniels became the third rookie QB to win 12 games; Brock Bowers (112 catches) and Malik Nabers (109) both broke the previous record for receptions by a rookie; Jared Verse is the DROY favorite after earning the Rams' only Pro Bowl spot. Fantasy football awards: Ja'Marr Chase's Triple Crown (127 catches, 1,708 yards, 17 TD) earned him Yahoo Sports Fantasy MVP. Other superlatives include Bucs RB Bucky Irving as the best waiver add and Jets RB Breece Hall as the biggest bust. Playoff droughts: While the Broncos are finally back in the playoffs, the same can't be said for the Jets (14 years), Falcons (seven) or Panthers (seven), who now own the NFL's longest active droughts. Race to the bottom: The Titans (3-13) clinched the No. 1 draft pick with their worst season since 2015. The Browns, Giants, Patriots and Jaguars round out of the top five. Plus… Plenty of players earned some extra cash this weekend after hitting their contract incentives, including Mike Evans ($3M for 1,000 yards), Geno Smith ($6M for reaching career highs in passing yards and completion rate, and winning 10 games) and Zach Ertz ($750,000 for getting to 60 catches, 600 yards and 6 TD, all of which he reached on Sunday). Victor Wembanyama played his 100th NBA game on Friday and turned 21 on Saturday, providing a perfect opportunity for our NBA experts to take stock of the young phenom's career and explore his ultimate ceiling. 1. Score from 0 to 100: What grade would you give Wembanyama at the 100-game mark? 99. Like the greats, he's exceeded great expectations. At 7-foot-5 — don't give me that 7-foot-3 nonsense — Wemby warps the game in ways we've never seen at his age. If he's this good at 21, I shudder to think what he'll be at 31. A playoff visit with this roster will bump this up to a 100. — Tom Haberstroh 2. What has been his most impressive feat so far? It is not just that Wembanyama is the leading candidate for DPOY. He is the best defensive player in the league by a wide margin. The numbers back it up. His length changes the shape of the floor. We can reasonably assume he will submit the greatest defensive season ever at some point in the near future, and then keep topping it for the remainder of the decade. — Ben Rohrbach 3. True or false: He's already a top-10 player in the NBA. True. We're no longer in a world where we can assume Steph, KD and LeBron are automatically installed in the top 10. Perhaps they live on the back end, but the transition is here. Big Slim might be a top-five player, knocking on the Jokić/SGA/Luka door because he affects the game in so many profound ways. — Vincent Goodwill 4. What is Wemby's ultimate ceiling in the NBA? The Kareem comparison is one I've liked for a while, even if their playing styles differ significantly. The overall imprint on a game is similar, only with Wembanyama being able to stretch the floor, and thus incorporate himself into the new age NBA. The greats are always evaluated on winning, and we're seeing a player here who could win multiple championships, multiple MVPs and lock down DPOY for a decade. We can't shy away from it: His ultimate ceiling is GOAT territory. — Morten Stig Jensen 🤯 Consider this… Wembanyama had more points in his first 100 NBA games than LeBron James, more threes than Steph Curry, more rebounds than Anthony Davis and more blocks than Shaquille O'Neal. Washington, D.C. — Magic Johnson was one of 19 people to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom on Saturday in a ceremony at the White House. Among the other recipients: Inter Miami superstar Lionel Messi and Orioles owner David Rubenstein. Chicago, Illinois — Wrigley Field turned into an ice rink for this weekend’s ""Frozen Confines"" event, which saw thousands of fans brave frigid temperatures to catch a pair of Big Ten hockey doubleheaders at the iconic ballpark. Sydney, Australia — The U.S. defeated Poland on Sunday to win the third annual United Cup. Coco Gauff began the day in style with a 6-4, 6-4 win over world No. 2 Iga Świątek before Taylor Fritz beat Hubert Hurkacz 6-4, 5-7, 7-6 (7-4) to clinch the title. London, England — Luke Littler, the most famous 17-year-old in Britain, is also now the youngest world champion in the history of darts. He knocked off three-time champ Michael van Gerwen on Friday to hoist the trophy and take home a $620,000 check. On Christmas Eve, American surfer Alessandro Slebir rode a wave at Mavericks Beach in Half Moon Bay, California, that was estimated to be 108 feet tall, which would be a world record. Biggest wave ever? If confirmed, Slebir would break the current Guinness World Record of 86 feet, set by German surfer Sebastian Steudtner in Nazaré, Portugal, in 2020. But officially verifying the wave's height is no easy task. From the Los Angeles Times: For all of their ferocity, big waves are among the most ephemeral phenomena in all of sports — they're almost impossible to precisely rank. Once a year, a ""conclave of [experts]"" get together in a closed room and study photos and videos submitted by surfers from around the world in an effort to determine who rode the biggest wave captured on film. Submissions can come from anywhere, but the most common spots are Half Moon Bay, home to the mighty break known as Mavericks; the North Shore of Maui, home to a crushing wave known as Jaws; and Nazaré, where an underwater canyon funnels huge winter swells directly onto shore in an otherwise nondescript fishing village. How do you reliably measure a wave? It took 18 months to finalize Steudtner's wave height, and Slebir's ride will undergo a similarly meticulous process that includes a detailed measurement of both Slebir (height when crouched down, etc) and the wave itself. Where, exactly, does the flat water in front of the wave end and the upward slope begin? The last word: Slebir doesn't seem too concerned with records or fame. ""For me, I'm happy to have ridden the biggest wave of my life,"" said the 23-year-old, who grew up about an hour south of Mavericks. ""I'll let other people decide what size it was."" 🇺🇸 America loves football: The NFL accounted for 72 of the 100 most-watched U.S. TV broadcasts of 2024, per Sportico. That's down from 93 last year, but is right in line with the 71 spots the league claimed during the last presidential election year (2020). 🤑 Pickleball pays: The average pay of the ~60 women in the top two pickleball leagues (which have since merged) was $260,000 in 2024, per CNBC. That's more than double the average NWSL salary and would be the highest salary in the WNBA. 🎓 Realignment ridiculousness: Northern Illinois is set to move to the Mountain West Conference as a football-only member in 2026.

https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/oscars-2025-movies-watch-145929115.html,"How to watch the awards season favourites, and which ones to watch first",,Entertainment,Yahoo Movies UK,9 min read,"There are only a few months to go until the 2025 Oscars, which means it's time to find out which 2024 movies you should watch to prepare for the awards.",Tom Beasley·Contributor,2025-01-06T10:15:25.000Z,"With the Golden Globe awards now given out, we're officially entering awards season — the road to the Oscars. That means we need to take a look at the big movies most likely to be competing for the various statuettes on offer in the first few months of 2025 and the actors who are currently negotiating red carpet deals with the world's most famous fashion houses. Some of these films are massive blockbusters or movies you might already have caught at the cinemas, while others won't make their UK debut until the new year. Either way, we've got you covered on all of the films you need to care about — and the best way to watch them. Dramatic music at the ready, let's talk awards... Horror movies, historically, don't tend to do very well at the Oscars. However, Coralie Fargeat's grotesque body horror The Substance comes with the sort of behind-the-scenes narrative that is catnip to awards voters: it's Demi Moore's big comeback. Moore is nothing short of tremendous in her self-referential performance as a 50-year-old woman tossed on to the Hollywood scrap heap, who then seeks refuge in an experimental drug that unleashes a younger version of herself (Margaret Qualley). The actor has also now won her very first Golden Globe, which makes her the official frontrunner for the Oscars. Read more: Critics Are Trying Their Hardest to Get ‘The Substance’ to the Oscars (IndieWire, 5 min read) Fargeat doesn't pull any punches and delivers an onslaught of gore, but the film maintains its fascinating perspective throughout. It would be a bold choice for the Oscars, but they might not be able to resist the chance to anoint Moore as one of the top Hollywood leading ladies once again. The Substance is streaming in the UK via Mubi. There were plenty of alarm bells when Broadway fans learned that Wicked was going to be split into two parts for its movie adaptation. However, those alarm bells were drowned out by Cynthia Erivo's quite exceptional pipes and the film could be this year's blockbuster nominee. Erivo could be a Best Actress nominee for her performance as Elphaba, giving her another shot at securing the final part of her EGOT. Her co-star, Ariana Grande, feels like a dead cert for a nomination in Best Supporting Actress too after both were nominated at the Golden Globes. Read more: Wicked cast always knew the real title of Part 2 (Digital Spy, 9 min read) Bizarrely, the one category where we know this particular musical won't appear is Best Original Song. All of its musical numbers come right from the stage show. None of us, though, would bet against them sneaking a new song into the second part for another bite at the Oscar cherry in 2026. Wicked is available to buy and rent on all digital platforms, and it is also still in cinemas. There aren't many Oscar contenders this year — or in any year — as divisive as Jacques Audiard's bonkers musical Emilia Pérez. The film features Zoe Saldaña as a lawyer who is tasked with a bizarre job — helping the titular crime boss (Karla Sofía Gascón) transition to living as a woman, cutting all ties with her former life in the process. Read more: 'Emilia Pérez is a groundbreaking trainwreck' (Yahoo Entertainment, 7 min read) It's a wild and bizarre journey that has split audiences right down the middle, from winning the Jury Prize at Cannes to becoming the subject of social media derision when it landed on Netflix. Despite its divisive status, it won big at the Golden Globes — and is the second most-nominated film in the ceremony's history — so awards voters seem to have found plenty to love about it. Emilia Pérez is streaming now via Netflix UK. The idea of the election of a new Pope doesn't seem like the best backdrop for a paranoid political thriller, but nobody told Conclave like that. Directed by Edward Berger — who has Oscar cachet off the back of All Quiet on the Western Front — it's a complex and well-written drama, with Ralph Fiennes delivering a stellar central performance as the ""managerial"" cardinal tasked with keeping the conclave on track. Read more: 'Is Conclave's twist ending offensive or divinely camp?' (Yahoo Entertainment, 6 min read) Fiennes is one of the frontrunners for the Best Actor prize, while there will also be love in Best Picture and the Best Adapted Screenplay category. There's also a bounty of potential nominees in the supporting categories thanks to the enviable ensemble. It's sure to secure a decent haul of nominations, but can it convert any of them into wins? Conclave is available to buy and rent on digital platforms, it is also still showing in some UK cinemas. Greg Kwedar's Sing Sing is a truly unique and powerful story about what the arts can do for people in desperate circumstances. Based on a real prison rehabilitation program, it stars Colman Domingo as the head honcho of a theatrical troupe working within a New York correction facility. Many of the supporting players are real former inmates who made the most of the program during their jail time. The film is sensitive and smartly put together, benefiting especially from Clarence ""Divine Eye"" Maclin's intense performance as a version of himself. Alongside Domingo, he's the film's big hope in the acting categories. A Best Picture nod seems almost inevitable. Sing Sing is available to buy or rent in the UK on digital platforms. One of the most memed movies of 2024, Challengers became famous for its three-way kissing scene in the first act. However, Luca Guadagnino's exhilarating drama is about so much more than Zendaya, Mike Faist, and Josh O'Connor in a hotel room bed. It's a fascinating take on relationship dynamics and the way those interpersonal bonds can shift over time, while leaving remnants of the past behind. It's also a genuinely excellent sports movie. Read more: Challengers Steamy 3-Way Kiss Scene Was Not In Original Script, Says Director Luca Guadagnino (Deadline, 3 min read) All three leads are absolutely terrific and could secure Oscar nods, while Guadagnino continuously amps up the intensity en route to a cacophonous finale on a tennis court. Expect the film to do well in the technical categories as well, especially for Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross's score. Challengers is streaming now in the UK via Prime Video. Sean Baker loves to chronicle the outsiders of American life and, in Anora, he has struck gold with this tale of the titular stripper — played by breakout star Mikey Madison — and her romance with the son of a Russian oligarch. This raucous drama with comedic elements is the current favourite for Best Picture with the bookies. Read more: Is Anora the frontrunner for Best Picture at the Oscars? (Yahoo Entertainment, 4 min read) Madison will definitely get a Best Actress nomination and alongside Moore has to be considered one of the frontrunners to win the award, while Yura Borisov could get Best Supporting Actor attention for his surprisingly nuanced performance as a henchman sent after the protagonist. Anora is still showing in some UK cinemas. One of the more low-key awards contenders for the 2025 Oscars is this drama, directed by Jesse Eisenberg. He also stars as a Jewish man who, along with his unpredictable cousin (Kieran Culkin), travels to Poland in the wake of their grandmother's death. By taking part in a Holocaust walking tour, they aim to get a greater understanding of their heritage. It's Culkin's performance that is getting the majority of the awards attention from this film — and rightly so — but Eisenberg could sneak into Best Actor and his screenplay could scoop a nomination as well. A Real Pain is in UK cinemas from 8 January 2025. Sorry Christopher Nolan, but Brady Corbet would like you to hold his beer. After Nolan dominated the Oscars in 2024 with his three-hour biopic Oppenheimer, Corbet is taking on the awards circuit with an epic historical drama of his own. The Brutalist, in which Adrien Brody plays a Hungarian-Jewish architect attempting to grasp the American Dream, makes Oppenheimer look nippy, clocking in at more than three and a half hours. However, the reviews have been rapturous and virtually the entire cast is being tipped for awards, including Felicity Jones and Guy Pearce as well as Brody. The film has now won Best Film in the drama category at the Golden Globes so it could well repeat this success at the Oscars, though currently it's only second to Anora in the odds for Best Picture. The Brutalist is in UK cinemas from 24 January 2025. Music biopics are always big awards season players, so the idea of Timothee Chalamet playing Bob Dylan was always going to lead to the stage at the Oscars. Director James Mangold has form in this arena, having guided Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon to nominations for Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line, with Witherspoon winning Best Actress. A Complete Unknown, perhaps inevitably, focuses on the earliest years of Dylan's career — spotlighting his rise to fame on the folk music scene in 1960s New York. Chalamet is a real Best Actor contender and Edward Norton could make it into Best Supporting Actor for his performance as singer and activist Pete Seeger. A Complete Unknown is in UK cinemas from 17 January 2025.",0,[],2025-01-06 14:11:47,2025-01-06 14:11:47
https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/golden-globes-2025-best-moments-072511533.html,Golden Globes best moments from Demi Moore’s first win to Zoe Saldana’s powerful speech,,Celebrity,Yahoo Movies UK,7 min read,"The Golden Globes has kicked off awards season, and several moments stood out from Zoe Saldaña’s emotional win to Karla Sofía Gascón’s message to transphobes.",Roxy Simons·Entertainment Editor,2025-01-06T07:25:11.000Z,"The 2025 Golden Globes has kicked off awards season in style, and it proved to be a night of surprises, big wins and amusing moments that stood out over the glamorous evening. Celebrating both the biggest films and TV shows of the past year, the Golden Globes saw The Brutalist and Emilia Pérez win big, as well as Shogun and Hacks. There were some big moments across the night, from a stunning red carpet to Demi Moore's moving monologue about self acceptance after her first ever win, and a ""Canada-off"" between Seth Rogen and Catherine O'Hara. Without further ado, here are some of the biggest moments from the Golden Globes. After winning for her sensational work in The Substance, Demi Moore reflected on her time in Hollywood and said that she once was told that she was a ""popcorn movie actress"" and so had come to believe that she was never going to be acknowledged at events like the Golden Globes. She said: ""I bought in and I believed that and that corroded me over time to the point where I thought a few years ago that maybe this was it. Maybe I was complete, maybe I’ve done what I was supposed to do"". But she felt that the universe was telling her she was ""not done"" when she received the script for The Substance from director Coralie Fargeat. Ending her speech in a moving way, Moore added: ""I had a woman say to me, 'Just know you will never be enough, but you can know the value of your worth if you just put down the measuring stick.' And so today, I celebrate this as a marker of my wholeness and of the love that is driving me and for the gift of doing something I love and being reminded that I do belong."" Winning best supporting actress for Emilia Pérez, Zoe Saldaña was moved to tears during her acceptance speech as she thanked the Golden Globes for celebrating the quirky Netflix crime musical — which also went on to win Best Film at the end of the night. The actor beat out her co-star Selena Gomez to the win, but she celebrated both her and Karla Sofía Gascón in her speech when she said she was ""so blessed"" to share the moment with them. Honouring her fellow nominees, Saldaña added: ""I know that it's a competition but all I have witnessed is us showing up for each other and celebrating each other, and it's just so beautiful."" Celebrating the film's director Jacques Audiard, the actor hilariously remarked how he was ""so French and so chic"", as well as saying that she had always been a big fan of his work over the years. The actor tearfully continued to thank the film's cast and crew, highlighting Gascón's for being the ""only one"" who could play Emilia Pérez. Saldaña began to be played out but she tearfully shared final thanks for her family and her mother, who attended alongside her, before leaving the stage. Kieran Culkin has always known how to get laughs naturally, and his speech for his Best Supporting Actor win for A Real Pain was a prime example of that as he opened it by admitting he and his wife had done a shot with Mario Lopez and so he'd forgotten everything he had planned to say. Read more: Demi Moore earns feel-good Golden Globes victory as The Brutalist wins big What we know about the 2025 Bafta film awards as longlist is revealed ‘Demi Moore deserves an Oscar for The Substance’ Despite this admission, Culkin had a smooth acceptance speech in which he thanked Jesse Eisenberg, who directed, wrote and starred in A Real Pain. He also jokingly thanked his wife for dealing with ""what she calls my mania"", which he joked was ""a lot of work"" for his therapist. When Emilia Pérez won Best Film, lead actress Karla Sofía Gascón ended the night on a powerful note by sharing a message to transphobic people. She said: ""The light always wins over darkness, and I have a lot of things to say to you because you can maybe put us in jail, you can beat us up, but you never can take away our soul, our resistance, our dignity."" Speaking directly to fellow transgender people around the globe, Gascón added: ""I want to say to you, raise your voice and say 'I won, I am who I am; know who you [are]."" It wasn't just the winners that had some big moments on stage as Seth Rogen and Catherine O'Hara had a hilarious back-and-forth when they presented the award for Best Female Actor in a limited series, anthology series and TV movie. The duo seemingly improvised the whole thing, joking that they'd won lots of awards in Canada for their work in films like ""Gosling: The Ryan Gosling Unauthorised Biopic"" and ""An Otter's Tale"". Rogen and O'Hara's presentation had the whole room laughing, including an amused Jake Gyllenhaal who could be seen shaking his head and laughing as the pair began riffing about the R-rated comedies they'd ""made"". On the TV side of the evening, Colin Farrell won the award for Best Actor in a limited series, anthology series and TV movie for his work in The Penguin in which he reprised his role as Batman's nemesis. The actor first joked that he ""did it all by myself"" before he gave a sweet speech in which he thanks those working behind the scenes, including the make-up team who brought his unique look to life. But in a wholesome moment Farrell also thanked a woman named Carolina from the crafts service team for helping him not to overheat while he was in his costume. After the awkward hosting duties of Jo Koy in 2024, the Golden Globes decided to tap Nikki Glazer for the 2025 ceremony and the comedian did a much better job in the hot seat. Glazer had an amusing opening monologue that riffed on the rise of Ozempic, poked fun at Timotheé Chalamet's name and facial hair, and joked that Selena Gomez's fiancé Benny Blanco had a ""genie who granted him that wish.” The host also had some fun moments during the show, including a riff of Wicked song Popular that mixed the musical with Conclave as she called it ""Pope-ular"".",0,[],2025-01-06 14:12:05,2025-01-07 01:53:14

""I essentially do everything I used to do, just slower,"" Fonda told People, adding that she loves walking. Research has shown that walking just 4,000 steps a day can lower a person's risk of dying early. Jane Fonda may be 87, but she's still as fit as a fiddle. In fact, her workout routine hasn't changed much over the years, the actor told People in an interview published over the weekend. ""I essentially do everything I used to do, just slower,"" Fonda said. ""I used to be a runner, but now I love walking. I love being outdoors in the woods, especially up and down hills."" Regardless of her schedule, Fonda ensures that she gets a bit of exercise every day. ""I work out every day, so it is important to mix up the way I move. I alternate days doing upper body and lower body work for strength. I also find some way to get cardio in. Walking outside is one of my favorite ways to do so,"" she said. The actor has long been passionate about fitness. In the '80s, she released a series of home workout videos, beginning with ""Jane Fonda's Workout"" in 1982. Looking back at her home workout tapes, Fonda said she had ""no idea"" they would become so popular. ""When I was starting out, there weren't many rigorous forms of exercise available to women,"" Fonda said. ""I learned the basic workout from a charismatic teacher named Leni Kasden in the '70s."" After the videos were released, she would receive ""amazing letters from around the world"" from fans about how the workouts impacted their lives, she added. ""One was from a young woman in the Peace Corps in Guatemala who did the exercises in her mud hut,"" Fonda said. ""Another woman said she looked in the mirror as she was brushing her teeth and noticed new muscles in her arms. She wrote that it made her feel empowered, and that day she went to work and stood up to her handsy boss for the first time."" For those who lead sedentary lifestyles, the best thing they can do for their health is to start somewhere, Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, a preventative cardiologist, told Business Insider previously. ""Doing something is better than doing nothing,"" she said. ""If walking is the beginning stages of embracing a heart healthy life, then it is the initial stages that will create habits that will be sustainable and last for a lifetime."" A study published in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology in 2023 found that walking just 4,000 steps a day can lower a person's risk of dying early. Research shows that walking can help reduce stress and anxiety while improving heart health. Some studies also suggest that brisk walking — at about 2.7 to 3 miles an hour — can make a bigger difference in terms of health benefits.

Before then, the teams on the outside looking will likely be making headlines. Jacksonville Jaguars: Jags owner Shad Khan released a statement Monday announcing the firing of Doug Pederson, a move that had been expected since the middle of the season. The 4-13 Jaguars started 2024 with a four-game losing streak, then lost five straight games from Week 8 through 13 while QB Trevor Lawrence had another injury-filled season. While Pederson has been fired, general manager Trent Baalke will remain in place. New England Patriots: The Patriots now need a new head coach after firing Jerod Mayo right after their Week 18 victory over the Bills, which meant they lost out on the No. 1 overall pick. With Drake Maye in place, it's an attractive opening, as much as the rest of the roster needs work. Team owner Robert Kraft will presumably have more patience with the next hire than Mayo, a former Patriots player who lasted just one season replacing Bill Belichick. New Orleans Saints: Dennis Allen was fired on Nov. 4 after a seventh straight loss that evaporated a strong 2-0 start. Allen went 18-25 in three seasons in New Orleans and failed to make the postseason. Darren Rizzi finished the 2024 campaign 5-12. Whoever takes the reins faces a rebuild amid the Saints' usual salary-cap headaches and uncertainty at the QB position. New York Jets: This is one of the messier positions in the league as the franchise is also looking for a general manager. The club fired head coach Robert Saleh on Oct. 8 after starting 2-3 and GM Joe Douglas was dismissed six weeks later. While the team has begun interviews, it's unclear whether QB Aaron Rodgers will be part of the new regime. Mike Vrabel reportedly interviewed for the job last week, along with Ron Rivera. ESPN analyst Louis Riddick interviewed for the GM position. Chicago Bears: The Bears made history by firing their head coach in-season for the first time, with Thomas Brown taking over as the team was amid a 10-game losing streak that ended with a win over the Packers in the season finale. Whoever replaces Matt Eberflus will be charged primarily with getting No. 1 overall pick Caleb Williams on track after a rocky rookie season. The list of head coach openings is sure to grow in the coming days, but the New York Giants will not be looking for new leadership. Owner John Mara announced Monday that head coach Brian Daboll and general manager Joe Schoen will remain in place for the 2025 season. However, the Las Vegas Raiders (Antonio Pierce) and Dallas Cowboys (Mike McCarthy) may be among the teams that could make a change at head coach. As for the teams that will turn their attention to playoff preparation over the next two weeks, here's a look at next weekend's matchups. Follow along with Yahoo Sports as the NFL turns the page from the regular season to the playoffs. After a rough 4-13 season, the Jaguars have fired head coach Doug Pederson. But general manager Trent Baalke will stay in his position ""I strongly believe it is possible next season to restore the winning environment we had here not long ago,"" owner Shad Khan said in a statement.

Seahawks' first-year head coach Mike Macdonald hired Grubb onto his staff following a long career in offensive college coaching. He was hired by Kalen DeBoer as a member of the Sioux Falls coaching team, and followed DeBoer to Eastern Michigan, Fresno State, and finally to Washington, where DeBoer named him assistant head coach, offensive coordinator, and quarterbacks coach.

He was escorted to the medical tent with a pronounced limp, then went to the locker room. The Ravens initially announced Flowers as questionable to return with a knee injury, but later downgraded his status to out. The Ravens will host the Steelers on Saturday night at 8 p.m. ET.

Now the Raiders are in position to revamp their quarterback room and add pieces in the offseason. Expect minority owner Tom Brady to have a huge say in their future. The first decision to come figures to be Pierce. Given the Raiders and other teams having legitimate interest in hiring Mike Vrabel, I believe he's the name of gravity concerning the Patriots' firing of Jerod Mayo. This will be New England's last shot to pursue him. He almost certainly will not be available down the line. After just one season, the New England Patriots are moving on from head coach Jerod Mayo.

Their reward: the most dangerous wild-card of the playoffs. The Rams lost to the Seattle Seahawks 30-25 on Sunday, knocking them down to the No. 4 seed in the NFC side of the playoffs. The No. 3 Buccaneers are now set to face the Washington Commanders in the wild-card round next Sunday, while the Rams will be saddled on Jan. 13 with the 14-3 Minnesota Vikings. You can probably figure out which is the better matchup. Regardless, the Rams were quick to remind the Seahawks, and the rest of the NFC West, who still had a game to play next week. pic.twitter.com/ym8jVs9yBh — Los Angeles Rams (@RamsNFL) January 6, 2025 It's not like Garoppolo was a disaster. He finished the game 27-of-41 for 334 yards, two touchdowns and an interception while playing with a shorthanded offense. In addition to Stafford, Rams head coach Sean McVay opted to sit running back Kyren Williams, wide receivers Puka Nacua and Cooper Kupp, guard Kevin Dotson and tackles Alaric Jackson and Rob Havenstein. Third-string running back Ronnie Rivers posted 48 rushing yards on 12 attempts, while No. 2 back Blake Corum got two rushes for 10 yards. Jordan Whittington was the top receiver with 86 yards on three catches. Essentially, McVay decided he would rather face the Vikings or Lions with his offense as healthy as possible than take on the Commanders with one of his top contributors possibly injured. McVay has never been worried about people second-guessing his decisions. The Rams received an unfortunate proof of concept via Corum, as McVay told reporters after the game the rookie fractured his forearm during the game and is out for the playoffs. For a minute, though, it looked like the Rams were going to have their cake and eat it too. They took a 25-24 lead in the fourth quarter, and while the Seahawks responded with a Geno Smith-to-Noah Fant touchdown, they reached as far as the red zone for a potential game-winning touchdown.

Steve Smith (2005), Sterling Sharpe (1992), Jerry Rice (1990) and Lance Alworth (1966) are the others. At 24, Chase is also the youngest player in league history to win the triple crown. Chase is the first Bengals player to lead the league in all three categories, which is something he largely knew was his going into Saturday’s regular-season finale. He led Detroit Lions wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown by eight catches, and held a four-receiving touchdown lead over St. Brown and Washington Commanders star Terry McLaurin. Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Justin Jefferson was closest in receiving yards, but he was 133 back before Week 18. Chase came just shy of breaking Carl Pickens’ franchise record for most receiving touchdowns in a single season. He needed two in Saturday’s 19-17 win over the Steelers, but came home with just one. He leads the franchise in the other two categories. The Bengals finished the season with a 9-8 record and missed the playoffs for a second straight year. All of this came after Chase’s contract dispute with the team this past fall. He rejoined the team in time for Week 1 despite not getting a new long-term deal, and he’s set to make $21.8 million next year, which is the option year of his initial rookie contract. Based on his performance on the field this season, and how close he reportedly came to this mark already, Chase is sure to be in line to become the highest-paid wide receiver in the league when that happens.

https://uk.style.yahoo.com/zendaya-tom-holland-engaged-golden-globes-124944379.html,"As Zendaya hints at Tom Holland engagement, why do we care about celebrity weddings?",,Celebrity,Yahoo Life UK,5 min read,The Dune actor sparked speculation she could be engaged after wearing a sparkler on her ring finger at the 2025 Golden Globes.,Marie-Claire Dorking·Contributor,2025-01-06T12:49:44.000Z,"Zendaya made an appearance on the red carpet at the 82nd Golden Globes looking typically incredible. However, it wasn't her burnt orange strapless dress that got people talking, but the giant diamond she wore on her left ring finger. Of course it didn't take long for social media to wonder if this means she may be engaged to boyfriend, fellow actor, Tom Holland. ""Zendaya with a diamond ring on THAT finger omg…,"" one user wrote on X (formerly Twitter). ""Finding out that zendaya has a tiny 't' tattoo and an engagement ring was not on my golden globes bingo card,"" another user added. ""Am i tripping or is zendaya wearing an engagement ring?"" yet another user asked. Others speculated that this had to be a pointed move by the Euphoria actor. ""I’ve checked previous pictures of her on red carpets and she’s never warn a ring on her wedding finger until now,"" one user wrote. ""I'm sorry Zendaya is too PR trained to wear a ring like that on THAT specific finger if it wasn’t a legit engagement ring,"" insisted another. Later during the awards it appeared to some viewers that she was showing the ring to another attendee, prompting further rumours. And the fact she wasn't trying to hide her left hand, also made people suspect she could be soft-launching the fact she was betrothed. So is the Dune actor engaged to her British beau? As the Golden Globes have only just wrapped, there has been no official comment about the ring from Zendaya, which isn't actually a surprise. Zendaya has been romantically linked to Holland since July 2021, but the couple have largely chosen to keep their relationship out of the spotlight, however, she has made a few comments on the couple's private life together. ""Parts of my life, I accept, are going to be public,” Zendaya told Elle US in 2023. ""I can’t not be a person and live my life and love the person I love. But also, I do have control over what I choose to share. It’s about protecting the peace and letting things be your own but also not being afraid to exist. You can’t hide. That’s not fun, either. I am navigating it more than ever now."" Of course, it's entirely possible that at last night's Golden Globes, Zendaya was simply showcasing jewellery from a luxury brand, but the interest the ring-wearing has cultivated serves to illustrate how invested we are in celebrity nuptials. Over the Christmas period fans were speculating about Dua Lipa's relationship status with her actor boyfriend Callum Turner after she shared a string of festive photographs with what appeared to be a diamond sparkler on her ring finger. And towards the end of last year some Swifties were excited about the potential prospect of an engagement between Taylor Swift and her NFL star boyfriend Travis Kelce, after pictures of the Lover singer's ring finger appearing blurred as she celebrated her 35th birthday, prompting one fan to speculate she was engaged. The 'are they, aren't they getting hitched?' is a regular rumour many A-list couples face, but what is it about celebrity nuptials that gets us so excited? Psychologist Lee Chambers says celebrity engagements (or the thought of them) can really resonate with us because they bring together our love of storytelling with the appreciation for the glamorous. This feeling, as if a celebrity is a close friend, is known as a parasocial relationship and describes a one-sided connection between an individual and a well-known personality, in which a person develops a strong sense of familiarity with someone they don’t actually know. And this partly explains our interest in learning of a celebrity engagement. ""We form parasocial bonds with celebrities, projecting our hopes onto their lives, making their milestones feel personal, like a close friend bringing good news,"" Chambers explains. As humans we have a desire for connection, so even if this connection is primarily imagined, or parasocial, it has a role to play in why we care about the finer details of celebrity relationships, including potential news of nuptials. Of course, how invested we are can depend on the celebrities themselves. When it comes to Zendaya and Holland fans have pretty much been rooting for them since 2016, when they first revealed their unmissable chemistry while filming Spider-Man: Homecoming. After appearing to debut their romance in 2021, the duo's colleagues-to-friends-to-lovers story has continued to captivate fans globally. It follows, therefore, that a potential engagement would kick-start a huge spike in interest in the next chapter of the Zendaya/Holland love story. ""Engagements are symbolic of love, commitment, and positive futures, offering an element of escapism and shared joy in a world that feels increasingly uncertain and volatile,"" Chambers adds. ""And the loop doesn’t close, creating curiosity for what the wedding itself will be like."" While we may have to wait for official confirmation of an engagement, no doubt any future nuptials ""Tomdaya"" may or may not partake in will largely be kept out of the spotlight. But that doesn't mean we have to stop imagining what the wedding might look like, what Zendaya's dress will be like, where they might tie the knot, who might be on the guest list. Obsessed? Us?

Hold onto your wedding rings, everyone, for Divorce Day is today. Falling on the first Monday of the New Year – which in 2025 is January 6th – 'Divorce Day' marks the date when lawyers reportedly see a spike in couples filing to end their marriages after the festivities are over. Happy New Year! While the most recent stats from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) reveals a fall in the total number of divorces in England and Wales, figures from the law firm, Stewarts, over the past few years have found that divorce enquiries spike in January, towards the end of the Christmas holiday period. But while it is true to say that after Christmas there tends to be a rise in enquiries, Julian Bremner, divorce specialist and partner at Rayden Solicitors, says the reality is that more divorces commence in late January or early February. However, there are several reasons why Christmas can be a testing time for relationships – for a start, spending prolonged periods with family over the festive season. ""For many, Christmas is a wonderful time of year full of good memories,"" Bremner previously told Yahoo Life. ""For others, Christmas can be a more trying period. ""It can create needless tension within a family as arrangements for Christmas Day etc are entered into. It may also mean spending time with people that you ordinarily would not want to. ""The weather and lack of transport can sometimes mean that you are forced into proximity with people you may not have been getting on with or, in the case of your soon-to-be former partner, are thinking of divorcing,"" Bremner continues. ""So whilst Christmas is a joyous time for some, for others it can be a minefield of stress and strain."" All of this can bubble to the surface over the Christmas period and test relationships which may already be in difficulty. This is a very personal decision, of course, but according to Bremner you will often know if separating is the right path. Consider the practicalities Bremner recommends considering the practical implications of starting divorce proceedings. ""Are you still to continue living under the same roof? How do you manage your life on a day-to-day basis? What do you tell the children and when? What other considerations do you have coming up in the future which will be impacted by this decision?"" he says. Ask yourself: Is your relationship salvageable? Before starting divorce proceedings, make sure your relationship has completely broken down, instead of just going through a rough patch. “A bad patch is usually driven by situational factors such as temporary pressure at work, the birth of a baby or temporary illness. These can be worked through with empathic communication,” Kate Daly, co-founder of online divorce services company Amicable and host of The Divorce Podcast, previously told Yahoo Life. ""A complete breakdown in a relationship is more challenging to repair. It’s often based on more fundamental differences on a deeper values level or a breach of trust.” Daly cites psychologist John Gottman’s model that identifies if a relationship is salvageable. He concluded that a relationship is unlikely to last if it is characterised by one of these four behaviours: contempt, criticism, defensiveness and stonewalling. ""It’s probably best to seek professional help if these are features of your relationship,"" says Daly. ""If you can’t overcome these issues, then it’s likely you’re headed for a divorce."" In some instances, divorce can be a mutual decision if you both feel that your relationship has run its course. ""This is particularly prevalent in longer marriages where issues may have been apparent for some time,"" explains Daly. ""Where there is an acceptance of the breakdown then agreeing to divorce can be a relief and a decision that can be taken mutually. The new laws also mean that you can divorce each other (by making a joint application to divorce) rather than one person being the instigator."" If you're the instigator of the split, then how you start the conversations about divorce often determine how amicable the separation will be. ""Never threaten divorce in the heat of the moment or during a row,"" Daly says. ""This can fatally damage a relationship that could actually be repaired with some work."" She suggests taking time to consider whether the relationship is truly over and if it is, find a quiet time to tell your partner how you are feeling. ""Accept your partner is hearing this for the first time and will be shocked (even if you think it’s obvious there are problems),"" she continues. ""Remember you have been thinking about this for a while – they are in a different place emotionally and are likely to experience anger, denial and fear."" Daly recommends giving your partner space to process their emotions, keep the initial conversation short, but be prepared to revisit the conversation and answer their questions several times over. ""Don’t be tempted to wade in with discussions about how you’ll split money and property or where the children will live,"" she adds. ""These are all important conversations but not for right now.""

The bash, held at Mar-a-Lago without prior advertisement or invitations sent out to the press, featured the Republican president-elect praising attorney John Eastman’s role in pressuring then-Vice President Mike Pence not to certify the results of the presidential vote four years ago, NBC News reported. Against a backdrop of clips documenting Eastman’s efforts, Trump is understood to have told party attendees, “I’m a big fan of John Eastman. Y’know, he was right. He happened to be right. That’s why they changed the law and nobody wants to talk about that.” Trump reportedly then went on, “They said he’s not allowed to do it, he’s not allowed to do it, and they convinced him he’s not allowed to do it, our vice president, then right after the election they changed the law so he can’t do it.” His comments also follow the president-elect telling reporters earlier in December that he plans to pardon participants in the Capitol Riots just as soon as he takes office later this month. Over at MSNBC on Sunday morning, host Michael Steele asked his fellow panelists, “What was the sense in this room, what was the purpose of this gathering, is it just an in-your-face-moment or just a tale of things to come?” Correspondent Vaughn Hilyard replied, “Let’s be very clear, there’s no coincidence that this event in which he welcomed not only John Eastman, but Michael Flynn, and Jeffrey Clark–the man [who] urged the DoJ to put off all statements about the 2020 election–and they were up onstage, Rudy Guliani was up onstage, and Peter Navarro, who spent time for not complying with the subpoena from the Jan. 6 committee, and they were watching a film that was a documentary about John Eastman.” Co-host Symone Sanders Townsend was decidedly more succinct in her response, saying, “Let’s just put a finer point on it, this is sickening!

The year is just getting started, but the actress, 54, already rocked one of her most memorable looks yet — a custom hot pink Christian Siriano flared jumpsuit — on the carpet alongside her husband Ben Falcone, whom she's been married to since 2005. While bold in color, McCarthy's bespoke ensemble was also bold in design as it was accessorized with a dramatic cape coated in various shades of pink and layers of ruffles. It was so dramatic, in fact, that it had it's own train. Speaking with E! on the red carpet, Falcone said that getting to the carpet was a journey because of his wife's outfit. ""Getting her in the car took about 15 minutes,"" he told reporter Zuri Hall.

Who will win every game in the playoff's first round?,"tyler dragon, usa today",2025-01-06T06:09:54.000Z,"NFL wild card weekend is set. The NFL playoffs kick off with three days of NFL action. All 14 playoff teams are playing for a chance to hoist the Lombardi Trophy at Super Bowl 59 at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. The Kansas City Chiefs are aiming to become the first team in NFL history to win three consecutive Super Bowls. Kansas City and the Detroit Lions both earned the top seeds in their respective conferences. Will the Baltimore Ravens, Buffalo Bills or another AFC team knock off Kansas City en route to New Orleans? Can the Lions advance to the Super Bowl for the first time in franchise history? Or will a lower seed emerge from each conference? The answer to those questions will start to formalize as soon as Saturday. Here are my NFL wild-card round predictions: The Bills won the AFC East for the fifth straight season. Led by MVP candidate Josh Allen, the Bills are the first team in NFL history with at least 30 touchdown passes (30) and 30 rushing touchdowns (32) in a season. The Broncos clinched their first playoff berth since 2015. The Broncos are ahead of schedule in their rebuild. It’s an accomplishment for Denver to be in the postseason. On the other side, the Bills are legitimate Super Bowl contenders. It’s going to be a tough game for a young, upstart Broncos club in Buffalo. Denver’s stingy defense will make some plays, but the Bills have the more talented roster. Buffalo hasn’t lost a game at home this season. Score prediction: Bills win 30-17 It’s always a physical game when these two AFC North rivals meet. Expect the physicality to ratchet up in a win-or-go-home situation. Lamar Jackson became the first player in NFL history to pass for 4,000-plus yards and run for 900-plus yards in a single season. Additionally, he’s the first player in league history with at least 40 touchdown passes and fewer than five interceptions in a season. He was the best player on the gridiron this season. Now he must translate his performance to the postseason. At the point in Jackson’s career, fair or unfair, he’s going to be judged on his success in the playoffs as the Ravens starting QB. The Steelers have lost four consecutive games and have no momentum entering the playoffs.  Jackson, Derrick Henry and the Ravens high-powered offense will overwhelm a reeling Steelers squad. Score prediction: Ravens 28-17 The Texans won the AFC South for the second year in a row, but they’ve lost two of their last three games. Houston did end the regular season with a win, although, they beat up on the lowly Tennessee Titans. The Chargers went from five wins in 2023 to the AFC’s No. 5 seed in Jim Harbaugh first year. Justin Herbert doesn’t have a playoff win on his resume. He has a prime opportunity to get a postseason victory in H-Town. Quentin Johnston is coming off a career game of 13 catches for 186 yards. The Chargers need him to be a reliable receiver if they want to make noise in the postseason. Los Angeles has the NFL’s top scoring defense. Score prediction: Chargers 23-20 NFL PLAYOFF PICTURE: How AFC and NFC fields panned out in final week The Eagles have a proven formula — they have a potent rushing attack and the No. 1 total defense in the NFL. They are the most complete team in the NFC. These two teams met Week 1 in Brazil. Saquon Barkley rushed for 109 yards and two touchdowns in their first meeting. The Eagles rested their 2,000-yard running back in the regular-season finale in preparation for a Super Bowl run. Expect the Eagles to ride their star ball carrier and MVP candidate this postseason. Jordan Love and the Packers will keep this wild-card game competitive, but the Eagles should fly high at home. Score prediction: Eagles 28-24 The Bucs, who won the NFC South for the fourth straight season, host a Commanders team that’s in the playoffs for the first time since 2020. Mike Evans reached 1,000 receiving yards for the 11th straight year. He could battle his former Saints nemesis and now Commanders CB Marshon Lattimore if the corner returns from a hamstring injury. Evans should have an advantage versus the Commanders' secondary, plus Tampa Bay will try to run the football with emerging RB Bucky Irving. Tampa Bay defeated Washington, 37-20, in Week 1, but that was Jayden Daniels’ first career NFL game. The rookie QB has since blossomed into the presumptive NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year. Daniels has the capability to be the most impactful player on the field in Tampa Bay. Score prediction: Commanders 27-24 The Rams' offensive scheme is designed to give Puka Nacua and Kyren Williams the football in advantageous positions. Nacua compiled 79 catches for 990 receiving yards in 11 games. While Williams rushed for 1,299 yards and 14 touchdowns in 16 games. The two combined for 227 yards from scrimmage and one touchdown when Los Angeles beat Minnesota in Week 8. The Vikings are coming off disappointing Week 18 loss that snapped their nine-game winning streak. Justin Jefferson was held to only three catches for 54 yards in the regular-season finale. Jefferson and the Vikings bounce back and get revenge Monday night in LA. Score prediction: Vikings 27-23 All the NFL news on and off the field. Sign up for USA TODAY's 4th and Monday newsletter.

According to Bedford police, the officer has been identified as 24-year-old Officer David Benway-Fongemie. Officers received a call around 12:53 a.m. on Saturday about a suspicious person at Country Inn & Suites at 250 South River Road. Upon arrival, two officers, including a K-9 officer, began an investigation. The suspect, later identified as Jared Masseur, 40 of Nashua began to flee the area on foot. Officers attempted to take Masseur into custody, but he resisted and began to fight officers. During a struggle with the two officers, a gun discharged as Masseur reached for Fongemie’s holster and attempted to take his service firearm. Fongemie’s gun was fired during the struggle and shot him in the leg. Fongemie was transported to a local hospital where he was later released and continues to recover at home. Fongemie was hired on September 9, 2024. Masseur is being charged with resisting arrest or detention, felon in possession of a dangerous weapon, attempting to take a firearm from a law enforcement officer, and second-degree assault. Masseur is being held in custody without bail and is scheduled to be arraigned on Monday at Merrimack District Court. This is a developing story.

The Flathead Valley native had been an attorney for 37 years by then. Opening a general civil practice in 1975 after a stint in the Army National Guard and graduating from the University of Montana Law School, Allison had handled an array of legal matters, including family law matters, probate, and juvenile and dependent neglect cases. He also served as chief public defender from 1998 to 2006 after working as a part-time public defender earlier in his career. And he felt burnt out. ""I'd never really thought I'd wanted to be a judge,"" Allison said in mid-December, ahead of his impending retirement after two terms on the bench at Flathead County District Court. ""Kind of about the time I turned 60 I just thought I don't really want to continue doing what I'm doing."" He already had decided to make what he described as ""drastic changes"" to his practice. It was time to reassess, he recalled while sitting in an unused jury room on the third floor of the Flathead County Justice Center. He planned to limit the scope of his legal work; cut out the aspects of it he no longer enjoyed. ""... I just thought, 'I don't really want to continue doing what I'm doing,'"" Allison said. ""What can I do differently that will allow me to use my experience but not require me to practice?"" Then two sitting judges, Stewart Stadler and Kitty Curtis, opted against seeking reelection. ""I just decided I wanted to try doing something else for the last few years of my career,"" Allison said. He ended up running against fellow attorney Bruce Fredrickson and another future judge, Dan Wilson, who was Flathead County justice of the peace at the time. Allison said he and Wilson became good friends after Wilson won a judgeship in 2016. Allison remembered turning 63 as he prepared to take the bench and telling friends he expected to finish after one term as a district court judge. ""But at the end of the term, I felt I was just figuring it out,"" he remembered. GIVEN THE wide scope of his private practice and his frequent courtroom appearances, Allison suspected he would adjust quickly. He admits he was mistaken. ""When you see it from the other side of the bench, things look very different,"" he said. ""I kinda thought I'd seen it all and then I got up here and every day something was happening that I'd never saw before. The breadth of stuff we deal with is almost unimaginable."" ""Search warrants, subpoenas, a lot of the evidentiary stuff,"" Allison added. ""And we're generalists in Montana ... [judges] do everything."" He presided over a civil jury trial after one week on the bench — there was no gentle acclimation. But it was straightforward, and the attorneys involved proved helpful as he got settled, he recalled. Then there was the anxiety of donning the robe and taking the seat perched over the courtroom, which Allison recalled being ""nerve-wracking at times."" And then came the decisions. ""Some of the decisions you have to make are truly difficult, and you agonize over them,"" he said. He recalled fondly a program former Judge Robert Sykes ran for community groups during his tenure on the bench between 1967 and 1983, known as ""You Be The Judge."" Sykes presented his participants with a case, walking them through each step of the judicial process and forcing them to reckon with new evidence and information along the way — mimicking how it feels to preside over an unfolding case, Allison said. At the end, participating laypeople handed down a sentence of their choosing. By then they were often singing the defendant's praises, Allison recalled. THOUGH CONFIDENT he is putting the finishing touches on a good, worthwhile career, he looks forward to taking a step back. ""I'm basically going to do nothing for the next six months,"" he said before preemptively waving away what he anticipates will be the next question. ""That doesn't mean I'm going to be a recluse. I'm going to spend time with friends and family and see how it feels to not be working."" Having taken his first job at 16, Allison figures he deserves a respite. He also hopes to rekindle his social life. Being a judge can put a damper on it, he said. Allison recalled a moment before he became a judge, when he was still a burnt-out public defender. He remembered feeling beleaguered; it seemed like everyone around him was dealing with intense personal crises. All in all, it had left him with a rather low opinion of humanity, he said. It was Christmastime, though, and he remembered walking into a Walmart. He looked up and saw a sea of faces, faces he didn't recognize. All these people who had no interaction with the criminal justice system. Soon enough he'll be in that crowd. ""I'm going to try to be a nobody,"" he said. ""And not see my name in the paper every couple of days."" News Editor Derrick Perkins can be reached at 758-4430 or dperkins@dailyinterlake.com.",0,[],2025-01-06 14:17:32,2025-01-06 20:24:21
https://www.yahoo.com/news/unrepentant-january-6-defendants-enthused-140034256.html,Unrepentant January 6 defendants enthused at prospect of Trump pardons,,US,The Guardian,8 min read,Many accused or convicted of participation in the attack on the US Capitol in 2021 believe deliverance is near,Rachel Leingang,2025-01-06T14:00:34.000Z,"Jake Lang, a January 6 defendant accused of beating police officers outside the Capitol during the insurrection, sent out a mass text message at the end of 2024 looking ahead to what he feels will be a promising year for him and hundreds of others involved in the attack. “Hey its Jake Lang!! The January 6 Political Prisoner!! I’ll be sending you IMPORTANT updates on this number,” the text read. “I’ll be home VERY SOON!!! God bless!!” Lang, who has been in jail for four years as he sought continual delays to his trial, wants to see every person charged for their actions that day given a pardon, which became more likely when Donald Trump won a second term in November. The promise of pardons from the man who inspired people to storm the Capitol looms over the fourth anniversary of January 6 and the first time Congress will meet to certify the electoral vote since five people died during and in the immediate aftermath of the Capitol insurrection. Four years later, more than 1,600 defendants have faced charges for their role in the attack. Many continue to deny their culpability and some have used their role in the insurrection to boost their personal and professional reputations. It’ll be like a biblical sign, a modern -day biblical sign of the deliverance of the Jewish people from the tyranny, from the captivity of Pharaoh Jake Lang If he is freed, having never stood trial or been convicted on the charges, Lang told the Guardian it would be a sign from God. He wants to go on a church tour afterwards to tell his story. “It’ll be like a biblical sign, a modern-day biblical sign of the deliverance of the Jewish people from the tyranny, from the captivity of Pharaoh,” he said via phone from the DC jail, which he and other J6ers call the “DC Gulag”. “We are undergoing a very similar process, and our faith and the struggle that we’ve had to maintain our integrity and not bend and capitulate to the torture, to the tyranny, to the evil, to the wickedness inside the courtroom, to take the plea deal, many of us who have stood firm.” Many of those in the J6 community have not expressed remorse for their actions. In recent weeks, they have pointed to a Department of Justice inspector general report that showed 26 informants were at the Capitol that day as evidence they were coerced and set up and therefore not responsible for what ensued. Some have close ties to Trump and his allies. Pete Marocco, who online sleuths have identified as being inside the Capitol but who has not been charged and has not directly addressed whether he was there, is working with the Trump transition on “national security personnel matters”, Politico reported. Russell Taylor, a January 6 defendant, was invited to the Trump inauguration by Republican members of Congress from Utah and is seeking court permission to attend, the outlet also reported. Related: January 6 was part of an attempted coup d’etat in America. Don’t let Trump and his allies tell you otherwise | Arwa Mahdawi A couple have unsuccessfully sought public office. Jacob Chansley, the rioter known as the “QAnon shaman” who dressed in horns and shirtless as he entered the Capitol, filed paperwork in 2023 for a congressional run as a libertarian. Ryan Zink talked about his January 6 charges during his unsuccessful run for Congress in Texas and called himself a “political prisoner”. Trump, who called January 6 a “day of love”, has not said how he will assess who receives a pardon, but that he will do it on a case-by-case basis. He hinted that some convicted of violent crimes may not receive pardons. He plans to issue J6 pardons quickly, he told Time magazine, “maybe the first nine minutes”. “Well, we’re going to look at each individual case, and we’re going to do it very quickly, and it’s going to start in the first hour that I get into office,” he told Time. “And a vast majority of them should not be in jail.” As of 6 December 2024, nearly 1,600 people have faced federal charges for the insurrection, according to the justice department. Of those, nearly 1,000 pleaded guilty, most to misdemeanors. Of those who went to trial, 215 were found guilty. More than 1,000 have been sentenced. There are still 90 people on the FBI’s Capitol violence website who have been identified by online sleuths but not arrested, said Ryan Reilly, an NBC News reporter who wrote a book about January 6 called Sedition Hunters. The justice department is still filing charges and pursuing cases related to the insurrection and is focusing on the most egregious instances of assault, Reilly has reported, but it is not clear how much progress will be made by the time Trump takes office. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of those who entered the Capitol will probably never be charged. Initially, federal prosecutors focused on people who entered the Capitol or committed violence outside – but they underestimated just how many people entered. “There’s going to be a bunch of people who will never be arrested,” Reilly said. J6ers see Trump as their salvation from a witch-hunt against conservatives. Political violence experts have warned that if most offenders receive pardons, the criminal charges are unlikely to deter others from committing similar acts, and the reframing of January 6 provides permission for people to use violence to achieve their political goals in the future. “The deterrence factor is certainly undercut, I think, by just the public narrative around January 6 itself and this notion that it was some sort of federal set-up that has been very popular in conservative media circles,” Reilly said. Robert Pape, director of the Chicago Project on Security and Threats at the University of Chicago who has studied January 6 defendants, said that most of those sentenced have stayed off the radar online since. But of those who have spoken publicly, most have continued to support Trump and election fraud narratives, and have not disavowed the beliefs that led them to the Capitol. Lang said he regrets that people died that day and in the aftermath but is “not ashamed” of anything he did on January 6 and believes the day “ended up being the imagery that the American people and the world needed to see of a united America – Black, white, Asian, Spanish, gay, straight, Christian, Muslim – all standing united together against a tyrannical oppression, against a Marxist coup d’etat”. The imagery was “very strong and beautiful” and that is what people will remember, he said. About two dozen J6ers, Lang among them, are currently in the DC jail, where their supporters and family members routinely hold a vigil to pray for those charged. Some are still awaiting trial after they have sought delays in their proceedings because they face lengthy sentences. “They’re sort of rolling the dice here and hoping for whatever Donald Trump is going to do down the line,” Reilly said. We’ve been through something no one else has experienced in the history of the United States Jenna Ryan But most of those charged have already been sentenced. Jenna Ryan, a Texas realtor, is one of them. She pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor for parading, demonstrating or picketing in the Capitol. She became one of the faces of January 6 and gained notoriety for saying on Twitter: “Sorry, I have blonde hair, white skin, a great job, a great future, and I’m not going to jail.” She was sentenced to 60 days in prison. She still posts online about January 6 and is writing a book about the day. She believes she was tortured in prison, where it was very cold and she was at times not able to get food. Some of those involved in January 6 have experienced job loss and financial hardships. Support groups, like the Patriot Freedom Project, have popped up to provide legal help, donation pages and employment leads. They also have merch – including a “Real Housewives of January 6” T-shirt. Ryan said she changed her name and closed her company, but she also found others who wanted to work with her in the aftermath. “I’ve had people literally have me sell their home because they knew how badly my reputation was damaged, and they kept me going when the whole world was against me,” she said. She regrets going inside the Capitol “for two minutes and eight seconds” but sees January 6 as a federal set-up. She thinks the media has falsely portrayed the day and the people involved, and that many were falsely accused. “You can’t help it if you’re in a trap,” she said. “Hopefully, I’ll never be trapped again. I’ll try to stay away from all traps.” On TikTok, she has celebrated the expected pardons from Trump. The prospect of a pardon has her feeling overwhelmed and grateful – it would provide “validation that this is bogus”, she said. She hopes the J6 community will have some kind of gathering after the pardons. “I just can’t imagine us not all being in one place, so grateful, and maybe go to Mar-a-Lago or something nice,” she said, “because we are now a family, because we’ve been through something no one else has experienced in the history of the United States.”",1,[],2025-01-06 14:17:32,2025-01-06 20:24:41

Hayhurst, Coshocton Tribune",2025-01-06T13:56:08.000Z,"COSHOCTON − Much was closed in Coshocton County on Monday for the first significant snowfall of 2025, although the region escaped some of the heavier snow to the east and south. As of 8 a.m., Coshocton County was under a level 1 snow advisory as issued by the Coshocton County Sheriff's Office. This means roads are covered with blowing and drifting snow and could be icy. Drivers are advised to use caution. At the same time, Muskingum and Licking counties were under a level 2 snow advisory and 10 counties in southern Ohio were under a level 3. A level 3 means roads are closed to all non-emergency traffic. Rob McMasters, director of the Coshocton County Emergency Management Agency, said that tracks with models which had Coshocton County out of the areas targeted for heavier snowfall. He said an accurate amount of snow for Coshocton County is hard to determine with the way snow is blowing and drifting. McMasters said he's also not seeing much chatter or pictures of the snow on social media. ""I think what it is, we didn't get much here so people really aren't taking pictures. If we got 8 to 10 inches, then people would be taking pictures,"" McMasters said. Coshocton, Ridgewood, River View and Coshocton County Career Center were closed along with Hopewell, Coshocton Christian, Sacred Heart, Head Start and Montessori Preschool.

One person familiar with the matter said that the cuts will be deep, impacting many dozens of employees,” Darcy, the former CNN reporter, wrote in his newsletter Status. Darcy also reported that the Washington Post reporter Josh Dawsey is leaving the publication and is expected to join the Wall Street Journal. The Post, whose publisher is the UK-born Will Lewis, did not immediately comment to Darcy on the expected layoffs. The cuts come as the Washington Post has faced scrutiny from within its own ranks following the publication’s decision in October to halt a planned endorsement of the Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, which was defended by the billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos. More than 250,000 subscriptions to the Post were cancelled in protest of the decision. Two opinion writers and an editor resigned in response to the intervention, which came shortly before the Republican nominee Donald Trump defeated Harris, won a second presidency and is set to be sworn back in to the White House on 20 January. Over the weekend, Washington Post’s Pulitzer prize-winning editorial cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned in response to the newspaper refusing to publish a satirical cartoon depicting Bezos. In December, two political correspondents at the Washington Post, Ashley Parker and Michael Scherer, left for the Atlantic. And in September 2024, the Washington Post laid off 54 employees in its tech software division, a year after the publication cut 240 jobs through voluntary buyouts. Darcy’s scoop on the upcoming newspaper layoffs at the Post came as the Bezos-founded Amazon’s streaming service Prime announced an upcoming documentary on the former and incoming first lady Melania Trump. Amazon in December also announced plans to donate $1m to help fund the president-elect’s second inauguration – and said that it would also stream the event on its Prime Video service, a separate in-kind donation worth another $1m.",16,[],2025-01-06 14:17:32,2025-01-06 21:52:50

According to the Indianapolis Department of Public Works, regular trash pick up for Monday won’t be affected by the snowfall but residents may see some delays. However, there will be no heavy trash pick-up for Indy residents on Monday, according to Indy DPW. Regular trash pick-up typically starts at 7 a.m. every weekday but the winter storm may cause delays for truck drivers. The DPW will typically notify residents of delays and any updates regarding trash pick up on their social media or in their newsletter. Get live updates on the weather here: Indianapolis storm, Day 2: Latest snow totals, forecast, road and flight cancellations For those who do have their scheduled pick-up today, the DPW recommends you place your trash and recycling bins on the curb in front of large snow piles. The city also wants residents to clear a 4-foot space on each side of their trash cans to allow space for collection trucks. It’s also recommended that bins are stored away from icy patches and that residents shovel a path from the storage area to the street curb, and clear snow and ice from the bin area regularly. Trash and recycling pick-up can also be affected by holidays, and pick-up days will be placed on a “slide schedule” where residents who normally have collection on a Monday, will have pick-up on Tuesday, and so on. Friday pick-ups will be serviced on Saturday. However, any holiday that falls on a weekend will not be observed, and trash and recycling pick-up will resume normally that week.

With increasing demand for services, some Northwest cities and towns in the region were down as much as 50%. But Lieutenant Colonel Cindy Foley knew the fight wasn’t over.","Bill Kaczaraba, MyNorthwest.com,KIRO 7 News Staff",2025-01-06T13:15:43.000Z,"It wasn’t looking good for The Salvation Army (TSA) – Northwest Division a couple weeks after Thanksgiving. With increasing demand for services, some Northwest cities and towns in the region were down as much as 50%. But Lieutenant Colonel Cindy Foley knew the fight wasn’t over. “In early December, we were 50% down year-to-date,” Foley explained. “With a lot of media support and rallying people, we closed that to about 30% a week before Christmas. Right now, we’re only two and a half percent behind across the entire Northwest, but significantly higher at 7% behind in Western Washington.” Foley said TSA served 642,000 people last year across the region. This number represents a significant increase from the 500,000 served two years ago, underscoring the growing demand for the organization’s services. The faith-based nonprofit is taking on housing and food, especially in hard-hit King County. While some communities exceeded their goals, others like White Center, Kent, Bremerton, Everett, Bellingham, Port Angeles and Vancouver, Washington are still significantly behind and will need to make up the fundraising gap. “Those communities had maybe even as high as a 30% decrease in the Red Kettle Campaign (which includes those bell ringers you see during the holidays),” Foley told MyNorthwest and KIRO Newsradio. “So they’re going to have to do extra fundraisers and make some separate appeals to their communities because they can’t afford to lose up to 30% in their Red Kettle campaign alone.” KIRO Newsradio opinion: Give to charities because it feels good “The campaign did well across the Northwest, but we’re still slightly short as we close out the year,” Foley noted. She attributed the shortfall to a late Thanksgiving, which shortened the fundraising season by five days, and volunteer burnout in some areas. Although the “bell ringing” season is over, the demand for food has skyrocketed with higher grocery prices. “Although I celebrate the success we have in changing lives, the rising need continues to be a challenge,” Foley said. In Western Washington, the goal was to raise $1,995,000, but only $1,866,000 was collected, leaving a shortfall of about $135,000. “What keeps me up at night is the increasing demand for our services,” she said. Like food insecurity, TSA’s efforts to help the homeless go beyond immediate relief. In King County, they provide shelter for 850 people every night, with an additional capacity for 200 more during winter. The organization also operates a tiny house village in Longview, Washington, and various shelters for chronically homeless individuals. ‘Street Level’ program attempts to find permanent housing to those in need A relatively new initiative, the “Street Level” program, takes the battle mobile. The goal of Street Level is to transition people into permanent housing. “We literally knock on the door of your car or your broken-down camper and say, ‘Are you interested in permanent housing? We’re the Salvation Army, and we’re here to help,’” said Foley. The program utilizes mobile vehicles equipped with trained case managers who provide immediate assistance, including printing IDs and accessing necessary information on the spot. This hands-on approach has resulted in 97% of participants remaining housed after one year, a statistic that Foley proudly highlights as unmatched in the country. TSA’s broader efforts to combat food insecurity have also been significant. “We’ve had two years in a row of a 40% increase in requests for food assistance,” Foley noted. The organization has responded by providing hot meals at various locations and assisting more families during the holiday season. “We assisted about 10% more families this year for Christmas,” Foley said, highlighting the ongoing need for support. Related news: Secretary of State warns Washingtonians about giving to fake charities The Street Level program is particularly noteworthy for its personalized approach. Case managers work directly with individuals to address their specific needs, whether it’s fixing a car, paying back rent, or finding affordable housing. “Someone’s descent into homelessness could have started with four flat tires,” Foley explained. “We can help you get new tires or fix your transmission, and then we work directly with landlords to find housing that a person can afford and sustain on their own.” Fundraising doesn’t stop after Christmas The kettles have been put away for the season, but post-Christmas virtual fundraising has begun at NorthwestRedKettle.org. The goal is $300,000, a figure the organization is well short of so far. Donations made online are allocated to the donor’s local community based on their credit card’s zip code. TSA allows donors to designate their contributions to specific programs or communities. “If no designation is given, the contribution stays in the community that matches the zip code of either your check or credit card,” Foley explained. This flexibility ensures that donations are used where they are most needed. 2025 will be a battle against funding shortfalls Looking ahead to 2025, Foley expressed cautious optimism. “How we do through Christmas really determines what the rest of the year will look like,” she said. “Early indications are that Christmas did well, but Western Washington is still down six and a half percent, so we will have to make that up in the local community.” TSA ranks high among charitable organizations that use donor funds efficiently. “In the five years of this program, 97% of the people we housed are still successfully housed to this day,” Foley said. This impressive retention rate is achieved through continuous support and personalized case management, ensuring that individuals have the resources they need to maintain their housing.

The actor plays Hungarian-Jewish architect László Toth in Brady Corbet's epic, which also won Best Film in the Drama category. It explores 30 years of the Holocaust survivor's life in America after escaping post-war Europe with his wife Erzsébet (Felicity Jones), and it is has earned rave reviews since it first premiered at the Venice Film Festival. With his first big win in the bag it seems the actor is now poised to have a big comeback at the Academy Awards in March, 12 years after his first win for The Pianist in 2003 aged 29. Brody has had an interesting career trajectory since his first Oscar win all those years ago, going from the Academy Awards to Wes Anderson, B-movies, TV, and now, hopefully, back to the Oscars. After becoming the youngest ever winner for Best Actor at the Oscars —a title he continues to hold— Brody's career took an interesting turn with him following up the win with four very different films: romantic comedy Dummy, M. Night Shyamalan's The Village, sci-fi thriller The Jacket, and Peter Jackson's 2005 remake of King Kong. King Kong was a huge box office success, and remains Brody's biggest blockbuster financially speaking, and it led to an array of unique movies, some good and some bad. On the latter end of the spectrum, Brody appeared in films like the poorly received Predator sequel Predators and 2014 action flick American Heist — the first of a number of ""action hero"" films he has starred in. He also appeared in an array of Chinese blockbusters, including the poorly received historical action film Dragon Blade, in which he starred opposite Jackie Chan, 2012's Back to 1942, and 2018 Air Strike. The actor also appeared in Rian Johnson's 2008 heist caper The Brother's Bloom, which is misunderstood rather than bad but did poorly in the box office nonetheless.

Brody first appeared in a Wes Anderson film in 2007 when he appeared as one of three brother's in The Darjeeling Limited — while not the director's most beloved work, it was the beginning of a great working relationship between him and Brody. The actor has appeared in five of Anderson's movies including the stop-motion movie Fantastic Mr. Fox, the hilarious The Grand Budapest Hotel, and the director's most recent movie Asteroid City. Brody has entered the celebrated Anderson acting troupe, and he remains one of his most frequent collaborators second only to Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman and Owen Wilson. While his movie career had its ups and downs, one landscape that proved fruitful for Brody was the world of TV. The actor may not have been seen as a TV star to begin with, but an array of well-chosen roles brought him back into the forefront of people's minds. His first TV breakthrough was FX two-part series Houdini, in which he portrayed the titular magician Harry Houdini, the limited series earned Brody an Emmy and SAG Award nomination in 2015. But it was Peaky Blinders that proved his big break on the small screen. The actor starred in the BBC drama's third season as Luca Changretta, an Italian American gangster who comes up against Peaky Blinders leader Tommy Shelby (Cillian Murphy). Undoubtedly one of the show's best seasons, it gave Brody a chance to go toe-to-toe with Murphy and he delivered. Brody went on to star in shows like acclaimed shows like Succession and Poker Face, while he also took the lead role in Stephen King-based horror series Chapelwaite. 2024 was an exciting year for Brody as he received a huge amount of Oscars buzz from the moment The Brutalist premiered at Venice. The actor has spoken of feeling a personal connection to the movie because of his mother's Hungarian Jewish background. The film has already won Brody an array of accolades including at the New York Film Critics Circle Awards and now at the 2025 Golden Globes. In his acceptance speech for Best Actor, Brody said: ""There was a time not too long ago that I felt that this may never be a moment afforded to me again."" And with his big Golden Globes win in the bag Brody has become the frontrunner at this year's Oscars, leading the pack with his toughest competition expected to be Ralph Fiennes' performance in Conclave. The Brutalist premieres in UK cinemas on 24 January, 2024.",0,[],2025-01-06 14:27:38,2025-01-06 14:27:38

Only two other teams have begun the playoffs on such a streak, as ESPN's Brooke Pryor pointed out afterward. The most recent team to fall backwards into the postseason was the 1999 Detroit Lions, who ended their season with five consecutive losses and lost in the wild-card round to Washington. Entering the playoffs about as cold as a team can be seems entirely relevant when asking Steelers players and coaches about their performance. But quarterback Russell Wilson didn't want to talk about that during his postgame press conference. Russell Wilson after Saturday's loss:""I don't really wanna talk about the past just because I think we've been in that for a little bit here. I think the best thing we can do is get ready for the playoffs."" pic.twitter.com/WYi6qHcBle — Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) January 5, 2025 ""I don’t really wanna talk about the past just because I think we’ve been in that for a little bit here,"" Wilson said, via Awful Announcing. “I think the best thing we can do is get ready for the playoffs. It’s a new season. That’s the only thing that really matters anymore at this point, right? ""The reality is, obviously us winning that game would have helped us in some form or fashion. But at the end of the day, when you go into the playoffs, everybody’s 0-0. You gotta beat everybody anyway. And that’s gotta be our focus right now."" So the Steelers are ""on to Cincinnati,"" as Bill Belichick once put it, emphasizing what was ahead and pertinent? Or on to Baltimore or Houston, as it applies to this season, depending on whether Pittsburgh finishes as the No. 5 or 6 seed in the AFC playoffs. Who the Steelers play will be based on a Los Angeles Chargers win or loss in Week 18. However, those four straight losses have a direct bearing on how the Steelers will perform in their first-round playoff matchup because they indicate the team is not playing well. Yes, Pittsburgh played three of the NFL's best teams in the Philadelphia Eagles, Baltimore Ravens and Kansas City Chiefs during its skid. But the offense has scored 17 or fewer points in all four losses. Wilson threw for less than 220 yards in each of those games. The veteran QB also made a crucial mistake on the Steelers' final drive, opting to scramble for three yards rather than throw the ball away or run out of bounds with 46 seconds remaining and only one timeout. That costs Pittsburgh 22 seconds. dudes brain turned off, he flipped on autopilot and pointlessly kamikazed into a defender pic.twitter.com/dhvjwv1yr4 — Warren Sharp (@SharpFootball) January 5, 2025 The Steelers' four-game losing streak didn't occur earlier in the season or during another season in which Wilson played for another team. It just happened, as ESPN's Scott Van Pelt and Ryan Clark pointed out during postgame coverage. ""We're not talking about 19— we're not talking about the Great Depression,"" Van Pelt said. ""We're talking about the game you guys just lost, that's the fourth in a row."" Wilson understandably wants to focus on the positive going into the playoffs. The Steelers can't replay those last four games. However, coaches and players will spend considerable time studying those results to try and correct mistakes and find any sort of advantage that can be exploited. That's football. To act otherwise is to be in denial while reality is confronting the Steelers head-on.",527,[],2025-01-06 14:27:38,2025-01-09 00:31:38

In the past five trading sessions, the S&P 500 is down more than 1.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite is off nearly 2%. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is lower by about 1.5%. In the week ahead, a crucial run of labor market data is set to greet investors, with Friday morning's December jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics serving as the week's most important release. Updates on job openings and private wage growth, as well as readings on activity in the services sectors, are also on the schedule. That data will provide a final snapshot of the labor market before the Fed's next meeting on Jan. 30-31. In corporate news, investors will watch for key announcements from tech companies such as Nvidia (NVDA) during the Consumer Electronics Show. Meanwhile, Delta (DAL) and Constellation Brands (STZ) are expected to report quarterly results. Another shortened week of stock trading lies ahead with markets closed Thursday to mourn the death of former President Jimmy Carter. The labor market cooled in 2024, but the Federal Reserve appears confident in its trajectory. In his final press conference of the year on Dec. 18, Fed Chair Jerome Powell described the labor market overall as ""good,"" noting that the ""downside risks"" that emerged in the summer of 2024 as the unemployment rate spiked ""appear to have diminished."" ""The labor market is now looser than pre-pandemic, and it’s clearly still cooling further, so far in, in a gradual and orderly way,"" Powell said. ""We don’t think we need further cooling in the labor market to get inflation down to 2%."" Economists expect incoming data to show more gradual cooling. The December jobs report is expected to show the US labor market added 153,000 jobs in the month, down from the 227,000 seen in November. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.2%. ""The labor market is on solid footing, but employment growth slowed and overall labor market conditions cooled in 2024,"" Morgan Stanley US economist Sam Coffin wrote in a note to clients. ""The good news is the labor market is not softening as suddenly as it appeared to do last summer."" As of Friday afternoon, markets were pricing in just an 11% chance the Fed cuts rates at its January meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool. The CES tech conference kicks off on Monday with a keynote speech from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. An analyst question and answer session is also slated for Tuesday. Nvidia stock is down more than 1% since reporting earnings after the bell on Nov. 20 amid concerns over delays of shipments of its new Blackwell chip. Nvidia shares still ended 2024 up more than 150%. Bank of America’s Vivek Arya told Brian Sozzi on the Opening Bid podcast Thursday that broader market forces and company-specific issues drove the sell-off in Nvidia stock late last year. ""What we have seen in the market is a rotation of money from semiconductors to software,"" Arya said, noting that the latter was less exposed to US trade restrictions on goods to and from China. He added that for Nvidia, ""the last two quarters have not been clean, really, because they're going through growing pains from one generation of product that was Hopper to the new generation of product."" The historically best seven-day stretch of the year for the S&P 500 came and went without any gains. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has risen 1.3% during the seven trading days beginning Dec. 24 amid the so-called Santa Claus rally. But this year, the index fell about 0.5%. LPL Financial chief technical strategist Adam Turnquist wrote in a note to clients that when the S&P 500 has a negative return over this time period, it usually points to a weaker year for stocks. Though, as we noted last week, last year didn't feature a Santa Claus rally either, and the S&P 500 still rose roughly 24% in 2025. ""I don't know how far the market falls from here,"" Ritholtz Wealth Management chief market strategist Callie Cox told Yahoo Finance. ""I certainly don't assign too much weight to seasonal patterns. Just because the market is falling during the Santa Claus rally period doesn't mean that we're doomed."" One key catalyst could come with next week's jobs report. As a recent rise in the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) near 4.6% has helped contribute to the sour sentiment around stocks, Piper Sandler chief markets strategist Michael Kantrowitz believes relief could be on the way. ""We think we need to see softer employment to get rates to start coming down,"" Kantrowitz said in a video to clients on Friday. Whether the soft data comes in the week ahead or later in the first quarter, Kantrowitz believes this narrative shift from the rising rate environment could help ""get equities going once again.""

San Francisco 49ers receiver Jauan Jennings and Arizona Cardinals cornerback Sean Murphy-Bunting were both ejected for fighting in Sunday's season finale. It was the second fight in two plays for Jennings, who previously got into it with cornerback Starling Thomas. The ejection cost Jennings a shot at a career milestone. He fell 25 yards short of his first career 1,000-yard season after getting tossed in the second quarter. The game was of little consequence to both teams, which were eliminated from the playoffs before Sunday's kickoff. The second fight took place in the end zone on a run play as the Cardinals held a 10-3 lead. Niners quarterback Joshua Dobbs ran 6 yards to set the 49ers up with second-and-goal at the Arizona 2-yard line. Jennings put a block on Murphy-Bunting that Murphy-Bunting did not appreciate. As the play ended, Jennings and Murphy-Bunting remained engaged in the end zone on the opposite side of the field from the ball. Both fell to the turf, then proceeded to engage in a wrestling match after the whistle blew. One official threw a flag that neither player acknowledged. As they continued to wrestle in the end zone, two officials did their best to pull the players apart.

For Jennings, the ejection meant falling short of a career milestone. The fourth-year receiver entered Sunday having tallied a career-high 923 yards on 70 receptions. Seven catches for 52 yards on an active day before his disqualification put him at 975 yards for the season. And that's where he'll end. He didn't seem to mind.

What you should know before you hit the shower,,US,Palm Beach Post,5 min read,The Department of Energy estimated the costs saved over the long run by the new rules would be about $112 over 20 years.,"Cheryl McCloud, USA TODAY NETWORK - Florida",2025-01-06T13:16:57.000Z,"As Florida residents shivered in the blast of Arctic air, the Biden administration was busy over the weekend. Among the actions President Joe Biden took was to ban certain natural gas water heaters, a move many said could send prices soaring, especially for the elderly and the poor. Here's what you should know. Under the new ruling issued by outgoing President Joe Biden, new non-condensing, natural gas-fired water heaters would be prohibited for sale starting in 2029 due to concerns about carbon-dioxide emissions, according to the New York Post. If the policy takes effect, as it is slated to on March 11, a little less than 40% of the tankless water heaters currently on the market would be banned, according to an estimate from the Appliance Standards Awareness Project. The new rules, which were published by the Department of Energy in December 2024, also stipulate new tankless gas water heaters must rely on 13% less energy than the least efficient comparable model on the markets today. The intention is to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, which climate change advocates and Biden said cause global warming, according to Fox Business. The 361-page ruling issued by the Department of Energy set energy conservation standards for consumer gas-fired instantaneous water heaters. ""It has determined that the amended energy conservation standards for these products would result in significant conservation of energy, and are technologically feasible and economically justified,"" the agency said. ""Customers will be pushed toward  buying models that are more expensive or lean on non-instantaneous storage tank water heaters, which are generally cheaper but tend to be less efficient than the ones that are facing a ban,"" according to the New York Post. The new rules will require new tankless gas water heaters to use about 13% less energy than today’s least efficient tankless models, according to Fox Business. ""The rules apply to both non-condensing and condensing gas water heaters, but the rules increase efficiency requirements to a threshold that only condensing models can meet, effectively banning the cheaper but less efficient non-condensing models,"" according to The Washington Free Beacon. Condensing technology wastes less heat. Rinnai America's — which calls itself the leader in tankless technology — tankless non-condensing natural gas water heater goes for roughly $1,000 at Home Depot, while a comparable condensing 75-gallon tank goes for about $1,800. Tankless technology is frequently used in smaller apartments or housing spaces, which means that a lot of lower-income and elderly people tend to use those types of water heaters, according to the New York Post. “Forcing low-income and senior customers to pay far more upfront is particularly concerning. DOE’s decision to go ahead with a flawed final rule is deeply disappointing,” according to Matthew Agen, the American Gas Association’s chief counsel for energy. The Department of Energy estimated the costs saved over the long run by the new rules would be about $112 over a roughly 20-year stretch. Overall, under the regulations, roughly 40 percent of the new tankless water heaters available in the United States today would be taken off the market by 2029, the Washington Free Beacon reported. ""Experts and industry officials said that would force consumers to purchase either more expensive or less efficient water heater models. ""One industry analysis estimates that consumers will pay $450 more on average when purchasing new water heaters,"" according to the Free Beacon report. The Department of Energy estimated the new standards ""are projected to yield significant environmental benefits"" between 2030 and 2059, including reductions of: 32 million metric tons of carbon dioxide 0.12 thousand tons of sulfur dioxide 86 thousand tons of nitrogen oxide398 thousand tons of methane The Appliance Standards Awareness Project supported the new rule. “This is a commonsense step that will lower total household costs while reducing planet-warming emissions,” said Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project. According to its website, the Appliance Standards Awareness Project ""advocates for appliance, equipment, and lighting standards that cut planet-warming emissions and other air pollution, save water, and reduce economic and environmental burdens for low- and moderate-income households."" “These long-awaited standards will ensure more families save with proven energy-efficient technology already used in a majority of tankless units.” ➤ Appliance Standards Awareness Project Fact Sheet Critics said the ban on certain natural gas water heaters would increase energy costs for low-income and senior households, according to Fox Business. Matthew Agen, the American Gas Association’s chief counsel for energy, blasted the move, labeling it ""deeply concerning and irresponsible."" ""The DOE’s own analysis claims the average life-cycle cost savings would amount to barely $112 over the entire 20-year average product life,"" Agen added. ""It's one more example of an appliance regulation that raises costs and reduces choices,"" Ben Lieberman, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, told the Washington Free Beacon. ""It bans an entire category of tankless water heaters and the ones that are most affordable."" ""If you really want to impact the water heating ruling, you really need to deal with the tank models,"" Frank Windsor, the president of water heater manufacturer Rinnai America, told the Beacon.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/arctic-blast-feel-brutally-cold-132215549.html,"That Arctic blast can feel brutally cold, but how much colder than ‘normal’ is it really?",,Science,The Conversation,5 min read,The answer depends on how you define ‘normal.’ The baseline has been creeping up as the planet warms.,"Richard B. (Ricky) Rood, University of Michigan",2025-01-06T13:22:15.000Z,"An Arctic blast hitting the central and eastern U.S. in early January 2025 is creating fiercely cold conditions in many places. Parts of North Dakota dipped to more than 20 degrees below zero, and people as far south as Texas woke up on Jan. 6 to temperatures in the teens. A snow and ice storm across the middle of the country added to the winter chill. Forecasters warned that temperatures could be “10 to more than 30 degrees below normal” across much of the eastern two-thirds of the country during the first full week of the year. But what does “normal” actually mean? While temperature forecasts are important to help people stay safe, the comparison to “normal” can be quite misleading. That’s because what qualifies as normal in forecasts has been changing rapidly over the years as the planet warms. One of the most used standards for defining a science-based “normal” is a 30-year average of temperature and precipitation. Every 10 years, the National Center for Environmental Information updates these “normals,” most recently in 2021. The current span considered “normal” is 1991-2020. Five years ago, it was 1981-2010. But temperatures have been rising over the past century, and the trend has accelerated since about 1980. This warming is fueled by the mining and burning of fossil fuels that increase carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere. These greenhouse gases trap heat close to the planet’s surface, leading to increasing temperature. Because global temperatures are warming, what’s considered normal is warming, too. So, when a 2025 cold snap is reported as the difference between the actual temperature and “normal,” it will appear to be colder and more extreme than if it were compared to an earlier 30-year average. Thirty years is a significant portion of a human life. For people under age 40 or so, the use of the most recent averaging span might fit with what they have experienced. But it doesn’t speak to how much the Earth has warmed. To see how today’s cold snaps – or today’s warming – compare to a time before global warming began to accelerate, NASA scientists use 1951-1980 as a baseline. The reason becomes evident when you compare maps. For example, January 1994 was brutally cold east of the Rocky Mountains. If we compare those 1994 temperatures to today’s “normal” – the 1991-2020 period – the U.S. looks a lot like maps of early January 2025’s temperatures: Large parts of the Midwest and eastern U.S. were more than 7 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) below “normal,” and some areas were much colder. But if we compare January 1994 to the 1951-1980 baseline instead, that cold spot in the eastern U.S. isn’t quite as large or extreme. Where the temperatures in some parts of the country in January 1994 approached 14.2 F (7.9 C) colder than normal when compared to the 1991-2020 average, they only approached 12.4 F (6.9 C) colder than the 1951-1980 average. As a measure of a changing climate, updating the average 30-year baseline every decade makes warming appear smaller than it is, and it makes cold snaps seem more extreme. The U.S. will continue to see cold air outbreaks in winter, but as the Arctic and the rest of the planet warm, the most frigid temperatures of the past will become less common. That warming trend helps set up a remarkable situation in the Great Lakes that we’re seeing in January 2025: heavy lake-effect snow across a large area. As cold Arctic air encroached from the north in January, it encountered a Great Lakes basin where the water temperature was still above 40 F (4.4 C) in many places. Ice covered less than 2% of the lakes’ surface on Jan. 4. That cold dry air over warmer open water causes evaporation, providing moisture for lake-effect snow. Parts of New York and Ohio along the lakes saw well over a foot of snow in the span of a few days. The accumulation of heat in the Great Lakes, observed year after year, is leading to fundamental changes in winter weather and the winter economy in the states bordering the lakes. It’s also a reminder of the persistent and growing presence of global warming, even in the midst of a cold air outbreak.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/plants-evolved-florida-over-millennia-132055567.html,Plants that evolved in Florida over millennia now face extinction and lack protection,,Science,The Conversation,4 min read,"The future of scrub mints could be in jeopardy because of climate change, development and misclassification.","Andre A. Naranjo, Florida International University",2025-01-06T13:20:55.000Z,"Modern scrub mints, delicate flowering plants that grow mostly in Florida, likely result from ancient hybridization, according to a recent study I published with colleagues. Scrub mints are a clade – a group of organisms that share a common ancestor. They grow exclusively on the North American coastal plain. Many species in this clade are endangered and confined to unique habitats, such as sandhills and scrub. Other well-known examples of clades include primates, orchids, daisies and insects. Hybridization occurs when two species interbreed and produce new offspring with genes and traits from both species. Our study suggests that scrub mints hybridized during a geological period known as the Pleistocene, which lasted from about 11,700 to 2.58 million years ago. The Pleistocene was characterized by dramatic changes in climate, including a series of ice ages. One significant finding from our work is that a group of scrub mints called calamints that taxonomists classified as part of the genus Clinopodium as early as 1899 are actually genetically distinct from other plants in this genus. These types of misclassifications create confusion around species’ identities, delaying conservation actions and leaving many rare plants without legal protections. Our work suggests that calamints may consist of several separate species that need new scientific names. This includes plants known commonly as the scarlet calamint, Georgia calamint and Ashe’s calamint. All of these currently lack endangered status. Additionally, we discovered that annual scrub mints in the genus Dicerandra – found as far north as South Carolina – originated from back-to-back hybridization events with their perennial relatives. Annual plants last only one growing season, while perennials can persist for multiple years. This ancient crossbreeding suggests that hybridization is a common mechanism of diversification in these rare plants. We also found that the Titusville balm, currently classified as a recent hybrid, has actually been evolving for hundreds of thousands of years. Reclassifying a plant takes time and effort. It involves detailed genetic and morphological analysis to confirm the plant’s distinctiveness, followed by a formal scientific description and publication. However, following these steps would allow these plants to be recognized under conservation laws. Our results could affect the future of these rare plants. The potential extinction of one of Florida’s ancient plant species is more than just the loss of an individual species; it’s the loss of millions of years of evolution. These plants have thrived in Florida’s ecosystems through gradual adaptations over millennia, and their disappearance would leave lasting gaps in the region’s evolutionary history. The collapse of these plant species also threatens the broader ecosystem, including wildlife such as scrub jays and insects such as bee flies that rely on them for food and shelter. And our findings have broader implications for how species are classified and protected under conservation laws. Of the 24 species of scrub mints known today, over half are listed as threatened or endangered at either the state or federal level. However, plants that hybridized recently are not considered true species under the Endangered Species Act. This means hybrids often lack legal protections, even if they occur in habitats that are rapidly disappearing due to human development. Plants that resulted from ancient hybridization are considered true species and can be protected. In our study, published in Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, we used genetic sequencing to analyze 238 different genes to map the complex relationships among these species. We then compared DNA patterns with trace evolutionary relationships using a dataset of all available DNA sequences. This allowed us to identify distinct lineages, showing that certain groups, such as perennial Dicerandra, were likely individual species. It is more difficult to define these relationships by looking at individual genes. We chose this group because we wanted to better understand relationships between species in a clade made up almost entirely of threatened and imperiled plants found entirely within a biodiversity hot spot. While our study clarified many relationships within the scrub mint clade, several questions remain. Plants typically have tens of thousands of genes. Each gene tells a different evolutionary story. Some genes might show two species as sisters to each other, while another gene with a different evolutionary path might show a different set of relationships. This wealth of discordant data means some evolutionary connections remain unclear, especially within perennial Dicerandra. Additionally, the full extent of hybridization events – particularly between perennial species – needs further investigation. Another area requiring more research is the possibility of hidden diversity within the calamints – meaning there may be species that look similar to one another but are actually distinct. Studying these “hidden” species could reveal new insights into the group’s diversity. While the current outlook for the scrub mints is grim, researchers are still unsure whether small pockets could survive in microhabitats or be rescued through targeted conservation efforts.

In my work as a computational biologist, I research ways to get microbes to produce more useful chemicals, such as fuels and bioplastics, that can be used in the energy, agricultural or pharmaceutical industries. Traditionally, researchers have to conduct several trial-and-error experiments on petri dishes in order to determine the optimal conditions microbes need to produce high amounts of chemicals. Instead, I am able to simulate these experiments all from behind a computer screen through digital blueprints that replicate the inside of microbes. Called genome-scale metabolic models, or GEMs, these virtual labs significantly reduce the time and cost required to figure out what researchers need to do to get what they’re looking for. With GEMs, researchers cannot only explore the complex network of metabolic pathways that allow living organisms to function, but also tweak, test and predict how microbes would behave in different environments, including on other planets. As GEM technology continues to evolve, I believe these models will play an increasingly important role in shaping the future of biotechnology, medicine and space exploration. Genome-scale metabolic models are digital maps of all the known chemical reactions that occur in cells – that is, the cell’s metabolism. These reactions are crucial for converting food into energy, building cellular structures and detoxifying harmful substances. To create a GEM, I begin by analyzing an organism’s genome, which contains the genetic instructions cells use to produce proteins. A type of protein coded in the genome called enzymes are the workhorses of metabolism – they facilitate the conversion of nutrients into energy and building blocks for cells. By linking the genes that encode enzymes to the chemical reactions they help make happen, I can build a comprehensive model that maps out the connections between genes, reactions and metabolites. Once I build a GEM, I use some advanced computational simulations to make it work like a live cell or microbe would. One of the most common algorithms researchers use to do these simulations is called a flux balance analysis. This mathematical algorithm analyzes available data about metabolism, then makes predictions on how different chemical reactions and metabolites would act under specific conditions. This makes GEMs particularly useful for understanding how organisms respond to genetic changes and environmental stresses. For example, I can use this method to predict how an organism will react when a specific gene is knocked out. I could also use it to predict how it might adapt to the presence of different chemicals in its environment or a lack of food. Most of the chemicals used in agriculture, pharmaceuticals and fuels are obtained from fossil fuels. However, fossil fuels are a limited resource and significantly contribute to climate change. Instead of extracting energy from fossil fuels, my team at the Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center of the University of Wisconsin-Madison focuses on developing sustainable biofuels and bioproducts from plant waste. This includes cornstalk after the ears are harvested, nonedible plants such as grass, and algae. We study which crop wastes can be used for bioenergy, how to use microbes to convert them into energy, and ways to sustainably manage the land on which those crops are grown. I am building a genome-scale metabolic model for Novosphingobium aromaticivorans, a species of bacteria that can convert very complex chemicals in plant waste to chemicals that are valuable to people, such as those used to make bioplastics, pharmaceuticals and fuels. With a clearer understanding of this conversion process, I can improve the model to more accurately simulate the conditions needed to synthesize greater amounts of these chemicals. Researchers can then replicate these conditions in real life to generate materials that are cheaper and more accessible than those made from fossil fuels. There are microbes on Earth that can survive in extremely harsh environments. For example, Chromohalobacter canadensis can live in extremely salty conditions. Similarly, Alicyclobacillus tolerans can thrive in very acidic environments. Since other planets typically have similarly harsh climates, these microbes may not only be able to thrive and reproduce on these planets but could potentially change the environment so humans can live there as well. Combining GEMs with machine learning, I saw that C. canadensis and A. tolerans can undergo chemical changes that help them survive in extreme conditions. They have special proteins in their cell walls that work with enzymes to balance the chemicals in their internal environment with the chemicals in their external environment. With GEMs, scientists can simulate the environments of other planets to study how microbes survive without necessarily needing to go to those planets themselves. Every day, researchers are generating large amounts of data about microbial metabolism. As GEM technology advances, it opens the door to exciting new possibilities in medicine, energy, space and other areas. Synthetic biologists can use GEMs to design entirely new organisms or metabolic pathways from scratch. This field could advance biomanufacturing by enabling the creation of organisms that efficiently produce new materials, drugs or even food. Whole human body GEMs can also serve as an atlas for the metabolics of complex diseases. They can help map how the chemical environment of the body changes with obesity or diabetes. Whether it’s producing biofuels or engineering new organisms, GEMs provide a powerful tool for both basic research and industrial applications. As computational biology and GEMs advance, these technologies will continue to transform how scientists understand and manipulate the metabolisms of living organisms.

Beyond Belichick's six Super Bowl titles with the New England Patriots, his poor personnel moves in his final few Patriots seasons left the franchise with a talent-deficient roster. The next head coach was going to likely lose a lot of games on a franchise that got used to winning. Jerod Mayo was in a no-win situation, and it wasn't a surprise when he came up short with a 4-13 record, fourth-worst in the NFL. It was a surprise that his tenure lasted just one season. Mayo was fired Sunday after one season coaching the Patriots. Statement from Patriots Chairman and CEO Robert Kraft: https://t.co/2YgHtzzBHK pic.twitter.com/GMXGgd768x — New England Patriots (@Patriots) January 5, 2025 Belichick lasted 24 seasons in New England and Mayo, a former Patriots linebacker and then assistant coach under Belichick, didn't make it to two. His final game as New England head coach was beating the Buffalo Bills in Week 18 ... to lose out on the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL Draft. The Patriots started Mayo's first season well, with a shocking win at the Cincinnati Bengals. Early in the season an outmanned team was competitive. There weren't many wins but that wasn't a shock. The Patriots turned to rookie quarterback Drake Maye, the third pick of the draft, and he played pretty well given the circumstances. But as the losses piled up, there was more criticism of Mayo's coaching and speculation that he might get fired at the end of his first season. There was a report late in the season that Mayo was safe barring a collapse, but a 40-7 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 17 that dropped New England to 3-13 didn't help. The Patriots will still have a depleted roster for the next head coach, but at least Maye offers some hope at a quick turnaround. Mayo wasn't given the opportunity to see if he could be the one to turn things around. Robert Kraft will now have to hire his fourth head coach of his 31-year tenure as Patriots team owner. Pete Carroll was good, not great. Belichick was perhaps the biggest home run in NFL history. Mayo, now, is done after one season. Who might he target? Former Patriots linebacker and established NFL head coach Mike Vrabel is a name to watch, per Yahoo Sports' Charles Robinson. Given the #Raiders and other teams have legitimate interest in hiring Mike Vrabel, I believe that he’s the name of gravity concerning the #Patriots’ firing of Jerod Mayo. This will be New England’s last shot to pursue him. He almost certainly will not be available down the line. — Charles Robinson (@CharlesRobinson) January 5, 2025",764,[],2025-01-06 14:32:58,2025-01-09 00:32:14

And I have dyslexia, so I tend to forget when I’m really anxious and I’m filled with adrenaline,” she said. Saldaña previously opened up about her dyslexia in a Variety interview, in which she revealed that she was put off taking new jobs because of it. “The challenges that I’ve had, they have to do with my learning abilities,” she told the publication. “I have dyslexia and anxiety, which prevented me from really going after roles – a whole lot of roles – that I know I could have done.” Since the awards show last night, many fans have taken to social media to praise her for the “shoutout.” One person wrote on X: “I’m really loving this dyslexia representation, especially how open Zoe Saldaña has been. I grew up watching these awards shows and it’s nice to see folks claiming it not only as a learning difference but as a superpower.” Another added: “Ok, Zoe representing for the dyslexia girls!” But others were surprised to learn that memory can be affected by dyslexia and were grateful to Saldaña for shedding light on some of the lesser-known symptoms of the learning disability. According to the British Dyslexia Foundation, those with dyslexia may find it hard to remember meetings, appointments, dates or events. Time-keeping can also be difficult. For example, they may misplace things like their keys, or get distracted by other things happening around them, which has a knock-on effect on their daily routine. To help combat this, the foundation suggests setting mobile phone reminders and calendar alerts, or asking for meeting reminders to be sent by the organiser. It can also help to have a set place to store personal items. As well as needing time to answer questions, dyslexic people often struggle to keep up with their thoughts, according to the foundation. Those interacting with dyslexic people should allow time for them to process and gather their thoughts, and demonstrate patience. More often than not, pauses in conversation are a reflection that they are considering a response – not ignoring others – or that they are trying to remember something. Dyslexic people may feel nervous about going to new places or navigating their way to a destination – and may often find themselves lost. “Right” and “left” directions, in particular, can be difficult to follow, or give. To avoid this, the foundation recommends that people giving directions to a dyslexic person avoid “right” and “left”, and instead be more descriptive. For those with dyslexia, your GPS or SatNav is your biggest friend. It is common among those with dyslexia to feel out of place or worried about saying the wrong thing in social situations. They may, therefore, avoid these types of interactions or be more reserved. Things like reading menus may be a particular sensitive task for them. The foundation says it is best to be open about your learning disorder if you have dyslexia. It is also important for others to demonstrate patience and kindness in these situations. Because of the amount of energy and effort needed to remember, process and communicate, dyslexic people may suffer from fatigue – which in turn can accentuate their dyslexic symptoms.

While it may seem daunting, you don’t need to be a top executive, famous athlete or popular musician to make big bucks. The secret is much simpler — and perhaps more boring — than that, and failing to take advantage of this one money rule could impact your retirement greatly. The median retirement age in the U.S. is now 62, and only 36% of Americans retired when they planned to, according to a 2024 study by the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies (TCRS) and the Transamerica Institute. About 12% of employees retired at the traditional age of 65, while most retirees (59%) retired before 65 and 30% are still working after 65.

Here's how The same study also suggests most Americans aren’t saving enough for retirement. Only 21% of those who retired did so because they had the financial means to retire comfortably, and 68% of those who retired later than planned did so for financial reasons. But working longer may not be possible for everyone. Highlighting this fact, 46% of those who retired earlier than planned did so for health reasons. But perhaps even more concerning, almost 50% of Americans are not saving for retirement at all, according to Rachel Cruz, personal finance expert and co-host of The Ramsey Show. In a recent Fox Business interview, Cruz said that, based on her experience, many are struggling to even find the margin to save for retirement. That’s why she says the first step is to find the margin in your budget. According to Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo, “The No. 1 thing to do on your road to becoming a millionaire is very simple: join your company’s 401(k) plan. Put as much money in there as you can, early on, and make sure you do not touch it.” Cruz recommends contributing to your 401(k) up to the match your company offers, if it offers one. Matching can add significant contributions to your retirement savings over time. For instance, in 2023, the median match for plans managed by Vanguard — which manages retirement accounts for 4.9 million people through 1,500 plans — was 4.0% of annual income. The average was 4.6%, while most plans had matches between 3% and 6%. So, for example, if your salary is $60,000 per year and your employer matches contributions up to 4.0% of annual income, the annual contribution from your employer could be up to $2,400. After maximizing your employer’s match, Cruz recommends contributing to programs such as a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k), which have tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Read more: Jeff Bezos and Oprah Winfrey invest in this asset to keep their wealth safe — you may want to do the same in 2025 For many younger people, retirement seems a long way off — especially when they have more immediate needs for their money. But Cruz says you need to adopt a “long-term mindset.” To build financial security and start on the path to becoming a millionaire, she recommends first paying off your debt and then creating an emergency fund that equals about three to six months of expenses. Once you’ve made it this far, you can then start putting 15% of your income into retirement, starting with a 401(k) if it’s available to you. She says it’s important to contribute to the plan consistently and avoid pulling any money out, even if the market is down. Waiting for the perfect entry point will likely cost you, according to Charles Schwab, and time out of the market could hurt your returns. To put this into perspective, research by Fidelity shows that if you invested $10,000 in the S&P 500 Index on Jan. 1, 1980 but missed the best five days in the following years, you’d miss out on $411,258 of potential returns by Dec. 31, 2022. It’s a not-so-secret rule that starting early and regularly contributing to your 401(k) — and not touching the money until you retire — can start you on the journey to becoming a millionaire.

Williams and Joey Garrison, USA TODAY NETWORK",2025-01-06T14:33:25.000Z,"Flags at federal and state government agencies nationwide are flying at half-staff, and will do so through Inauguration Day on January 20, which coincides with Martin Luther King Day. Here's why flags are flying at half-staff, and why President-elect Donald Trump isn't thrilled with the decision. Federal and state flags are being flown at half-staff as a sign of respect for late former President Jimmy Carter, who died on Monday, Dec. 29, 2024. Carter served as the the 39th President of the United States. President Joe Biden issued the flag proclamation shortly after Carter's death became public, and confirmed that flags will remain at half-staff at least through January 28. President-elect Donald Trump has lashed out over flags being flown at half-staff during his upcoming inauguration but the White House said it isn't reconsidering the order. Trump will be sworn in as the 47th president on Jan. 20, which falls within the 30-day window. ""The Democrats are all 'giddy' about our magnificent American Flag potentially being at 'half mast' during my Inauguration,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social, incorrectly using the term that refers to flags being flown halfway up the mast on a ship, not a flag pole. ""They think it’s so great, and are so happy about it because, in actuality, they don’t love our Country, they only think about themselves."" Trump went on to slam Democratic leadership in his social media post. ""Look at what they’ve done to our once GREAT America over the past four years - It’s a total mess!"" Trump said. ""In any event, because of the death of President Jimmy Carter, the Flag may, for the first time ever during an Inauguration of a future President, be at half mast. Nobody wants to see this, and no American can be happy about it. Let’s see how it plays out."" His stance on the flag-lowering honor aside, Trump did say that he would attend funeral services for Carter. Damon C.

The problem is also why they keep doing this.,Steve Benen,2025-01-06T14:24:38.000Z,"When it comes to prominent Republican officials getting caught peddling fake historical quotes, Sen. Rand Paul tends to be in a league of his own. The Kentucky Republican has, after all, been caught pushing fake quotes from Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Patrick Henry, Abraham Lincoln and George Washington. Paul, however, is not without company. On the Fourth of July in 2023, for example, Sen. Josh Hawley promoted a fake quote from Patrick Henry. (When he got caught, the Missouri Republican boasted that the “the libs” were “major triggered” by his willingness to amplify misinformation.) Late last week, House Speaker Mike Johnson joined the club. The Washington Post reported: Shortly before Mike Johnson was sworn in as House speaker on Friday, he stood in front of the incoming members of Congress and offered what he said was “a prayer for the nation” that was said every day Thomas Jefferson was in the White House and “and every day thereafter until his death.” Johnson attributed that detail to a program distributed at a bipartisan interfaith church service where he spoke earlier that day. Johnson told the lawmakers, it is “quite familiar to historians and probably many of us.” As it turns out, however, if the Jefferson prayer is “quite familiar to historians,” it’s probably because historians keep trying to tell people that the prayer has been falsely attributed to Jefferson for far too long. To be sure, the Louisiana Republican delivered his remarks with great confidence, quoting the Jefferson prayer at length, as if the quote were real. There is, however, no evidence suggesting Jefferson ever uttered the prayer. Indeed, this mistake is so common that the Thomas Jefferson Foundation has a dedicated online page — published long before the House speaker’s comments from Friday — that sets the record straight. We have no evidence that this prayer was written or delivered by Thomas Jefferson. It appears in the 1928 United States Book of Common Prayer, and was first suggested for inclusion in a report published in 1919. ... Ultimately, it seems unlikely that Jefferson would have composed or delivered a public prayer of this sort. He considered religion a private matter, and when asked to recommend a national day of fasting and prayer, replied, “I consider the government of the US. as interdicted by the constitution from intermedling with religious institutions, their doctrines, discipline, or exercises.” But stepping back, the problem is not just that some GOP officials keep peddling fake quotes from the Founding Fathers. The problem is also why they keep doing this. The common thread tying together most of these fake quotes is the idea that the nation’s founders were eager to combine religion and politics. The historical record proves otherwise. As historian Kevin Kruse explained in a terrific 2023 piece: [I]t’s better, I think, to brush aside these politicians and partisans who cherry-pick their way through the founding era and simply remind them that in the Constitution of the United States — you know, the document that actually founded this country and established its rules and norms — none of their wish casting for a “Christian nation” finds any support at all. Quite right. I’ve long believed that this effectively ends any debate: The Constitution is a secular document that created a secular government. Period. Full stop. For opponents of church-state separation, this nagging detail must be terribly frustrating, but reality is stubborn. Either the nation’s founders created a secular constitutional system that guarantees religious liberty for all, or they meant to base our constitutional system of government on Christianity but somehow forgot.

What to know if you live in Texas,,Lifestyle,Austin American-Statesman,3 min read,Here's a guide to protect your home from freezing temperatures and keep your pipes from bursting.,"Brandi D. Addison, USA TODAY NETWORK",2025-01-06T14:24:01.000Z,"Temperatures are quickly dropping in Texas as a polar vortex sends temperatures plunging. When temperatures dip below freezing during winter, failing to prepare for the cold can cause major damage to homes, leading to headaches for homeowners and thousands of dollars in repairs. Here's a guide to protect your home from freezing temperatures and keep your pipes from bursting. This time of year, it’s essential to check your local weather forecast daily to stay alert for freeze warnings. When a freeze warning is issued, it’s time to protect your faucets. In Southern states, many people take precautions ahead of the first cold front since outdoor faucets are typically unused until spring. However, if you haven’t yet prepared—or if you still need to use your faucets regularly—here’s some advice on how to protect them. Maintain a temperature of at least 60 degrees. Open cupboards and vanities to allow warm air to reach pipes, especially in kitchens and bathrooms, Brycen Sperlich, owner of Prime Drain Cleaning and Plumbing in Tennessee, told USA TODAY earlier this year. Set faucets to a small, steady drip rather than a stream to conserve water while preventing freezing. Drip the faucet farthest from your home’s main water valve. “You don’t have to drip them all—one or two is fine,” Sperlich told USA TODAY. Before the temperature drops below 32 degrees, outdoor water spigots attached to homes should be opened to allow to drain water out. Faucet covers should also be put on. Here are the pipes The Red Cross says freeze most frequently in homes: Pipes exposed to ""severe cold,"" including outdoor hose bibs, swimming pool supply lines, and water sprinkler lines. (If you have swimming pool or sprinkler supply lines, don't forget to drain them too.) Water supply pipes in unheated interior areas, including basements, crawl spaces, attics, garages, and cabinets. Those running against exterior walls that ""have little or no insulation."" If you're concerned about further damage or unsure how to handle the situation, it's best to call a local plumber to safely resolve the issue. However, you can relieve some of the pressure on your own. Here’s a step-by-step process outlined by the American Red Cross. Turn off main water supply valve This prevents water from flowing into the frozen pipe, reducing the risk of a burst. Thaw the frozen pipes Apply heat using a hair dryer, heating pad or warm towels wrapped around the pipe. Avoid using open flames, such as a blowtorch, as they can damage the pipe or cause a fire. Keep a faucet open Allow a faucet connected to the frozen pipe to run. This helps water flow as the ice melts and relieves pressure, reducing the risk of the pipe bursting. The main water shut-off valve is usually located where the water supply enters your home—commonly in the basement, garage or a concrete metal box near the street. Familiarize yourself with its location before temperatures drop below freezing to act quickly in case of a burst pipe.

Here's what to know.,"Samantha Neely, USA TODAY NETWORK - Florida",2025-01-06T14:00:57.000Z,"Thousands of Florida residents will see more money from Social Security soon. President Joe Biden on Sunday signed the Social Security Fairness Act, which removed two provisions that had cut hundreds of dollars in Social Security benefits for millions of Americans. ""The bill I'm signing today is about a simple proposition: Americans who have worked hard all their lives to earn an honest living should be able to retire with economic security and dignity,"" Biden said. The bill, passed by the House of Representatives in November, was approved in the Senate by a 70-26 vote last month. The White House touted the law as the first expansion of such benefits in 20 years. The Social Security Fairness Act eliminates two decades-old provisions that reduced Social Security benefits for some retirees who also received pension income — the Windfall Elimination Provision and the Government Pension Offset. The WEP lowered Social Security benefits for certain retired and disabled workers who receive pensions for work that is not covered by the Social Security system. The GPO decreased benefits for spouses, widows, and widowers who also received income from their government pensions. USA TODAY reported police officers, firefighters, postal workers, and public school teachers are among the nearly 3 million affected by the provisions. According to the president, Social Security benefits will be increased by hundreds of dollars per month in most cases — an average of $360 per month by December 2025. The Associated Press reported these amounts would also increase over time with Social Security’s regular cost-of-living adjustments. The president stated more than 2.5 million Americans will receive a lump-sum payment of thousands of dollars to compensate for the shortfall in benefits they should have received in 2024. The bill will cost $196 billion over the next 10 years, according to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office. Social Security officials must now take the new law and implement it. The law will adjust payments starting this year, but it may take a few months for officials to process the changes.

Trump can't possibly come back after this."" Until then I had assumed that he would immediately start his comeback. It didn't occur to me that he could survive inciting this violent assault, especially since he egged it on as it was happening: As we later saw on video, the crowd soon began chanting ""Hang Mike Pence!"" Later in the evening Trump finally emerged and put out a video telling the rioters he understood why they were so upset about all the evil people who ""stole"" the election but they needed to go home now. He said he loved them and that they were very special: Over many hours we watched as bizarre Trump supporters occupied the Senate floor and took possession of the dais. The Capitol was vandalized and trashed and rioters beat police over the head with American flags. It was the most shockingly surreal event I've ever witnessed in American politics. The whole world was stunned by the live pictures we saw over the course of that momentous afternoon. Yet later that night, once the police and National Guard restored order and the rioters dispersed, Congress returned to the Capitol and they certified the election. For many people that signaled that the guardrails had held, that the Constitution was intact and that American democracy was preserved. But when 147 Republicans still voted to overturn the election even after all that had happened, it was clear to me that was premature and that Trump wasn't done with us yet. They were all politicians, after all, with a much better knowledge of how the system works than most Americans and they knew his insistence that he'd actually won the election was a lie. Yet they voted to steal the election anyway, despite the violent insurrection that had taken place just hours earlier. Oh sure, many Republicans did make statements condemning the insurrection and criticizing Donald Trump for his incitement. But within days you could feel them starting to pull back, especially after they experienced moments like this when Lindsey Graham was faced with rabid Trump supporters angry that he'd said ""count me out."" Over the course of many months, between law enforcement and the media investigations culminating in the incredible work of the Jan. 6 committee, the evidence showed over and over again exactly what had happened. Donald Trump was psychologically incapable of admitting that he lost and certain people around him were more than willing to push the envelope to see if they could get away with overturning the results of an election. Through sheer chutzpah and mind-numbing repetition, they first managed to persuade many of Trump's most loyal voters that the election had been stolen. They flooded the zone with accusations and lies and when Republican officials denied that there were irregularities and recounts showed no discrepancies they attacked the officials. When the courts failed to find evidence of fraud and dismissed all but one case they claimed the courts were biased. They even managed to excuse Trump's trying to cajole election officials into ""finding"" thousands of votes to put him over the top on tape. And it worked. By Jan. of 2021, 66% of Republicans believed the election was stolen. Jan. 6 was their last-ditch effort to overturn the election. Had Mike Pence agreed to pretend that there was a legitimate controversy about the election results in the swing states where they'd recruited activists to pretend to be alternate electors they might have succeeded. The whole thing was a corrupt set-up engineered by Trump henchmen. The idea was to reject those states to lower the threshold of required electoral votes allowing Trump to win. If the Democrats objected, as they certainly would, Trump planned to then try to throw the election to the House (as the Constitution provides if it was a tie) in which case Trump would also win. (The mastermind of that coup plot, John Eastman, was even later revealed to have been counting on his good friend Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas to step in to issue a stay of the Georgia electoral count to give them the hook they needed.) Want a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course. It was a ridiculous idea made up out of whole cloth, but Donald Trump 100% bought into it. On Jan. 6 when it became clear that Pence wasn't going to play ball, Trump decided to shoot the moon and send his crazed, overwrought followers to the Capitol to intimidate the Congress and stop the count. There could be no other reason to tell them to march down there. They didn't succeed in keeping Donald Trump in office but they won something even more important. They proved that it was possible to beguile tens of millions of voters into not only believing a Big Lie when Donald Trump told it but even when they'd seen with their own eyes that it wasn't true. The whole country watched the riot unfold in real time. There were hours and hours more of video that emerged in subsequent days. Witnesses from Trump's own inner circle testified about his state of mind and how he behaved that day. And there have been hundreds of court cases decided by juries finding that people who participated in the event were guilty of crimes. Yet the New York Times published a depressing article over the weekend examining how Trump and his minions have managed to completely turn Jan. 6 upside down in his supporters' minds. They've convinced them that the rioters not only did nothing wrong that day, but they are now supposedly being held as political prisoners and hostages. They say there wasn't much damage to the Capitol, Mike Pence wasn't really in danger, the whole thing is overblown and it's the Jan. 6 committee that should be jailed rather than those who beat cops nearly to death on the steps of the Capitol that day. The article lays out the full trajectory of this new Big Lie that is so preposterous you'd think the people who believe it must be living in another dimension. But it's had an effect even on the population that doesn't believe the conspiracy theories that the Trump voters do. Many people understandably have come to accept that it really wasn't a threat to democracy or the Constitution since Donald Trump was elected to a second term in what everyone agrees was a fair election and therefore, the system still works, no harm no foul. But it didn't work. Trump was never held accountable either because of partisan support in the Senate which voted 57-43 to impeach him after Jan. 6, falling short of the 2/3rds supermajority which would have precluded him from running again. (Only seven Republicans voted to convict.) And the law was just too slow to hold him responsible even though both federal and state grand juries returned indictments of him and his co-conspirators for what they did. The Supreme Court eventually weighed in in his favor on clearly partisan grounds. We now know that if partisans are corrupt, deluded or just plain opportunistic enough and they have the will and the means to lie without shame or restraint, they can circumvent all the checks and balances that were built into the Constitution to prevent a president who plotted a coup against the United States from returning to power. January 6, 2025, should be a reminder of the assault on our democracy four years ago. Instead, I'm afraid it's yet another reminder that far too few people in this country actually care.",25,[],2025-01-06 14:37:56,2025-01-06 20:25:03

Patrick Coolican,2025-01-06T13:41:16.000Z,"Minnesota State Capitol. Courtesy of Minnesota House Public Information Services. Hopes for bipartisan comity at the state Capitol this year — forced upon the Minnesota House by the voters, who sent 67 Democrats and 67 Republicans to the Capitol — are already crashing. House Democrats are mulling not showing up for the first two weeks of the legislative session to prevent the chamber from achieving a 68-member quorum, according to lobbyists who’ve spoken to members and confirmed by two DFL legislative sources. Doing so would effectively shut down the House as Democrats seek to block Republicans from using their temporary, 1-seat advantage to elect a GOP House speaker. The gambit would attract national media attention and likely lead to a political and legal firestorm. State Rep. Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn Park, the Democratic-Farmer-Labor leader, declined to comment except to say that House Democrats “want a power sharing agreement we’ve spent 60 days negotiating, and we’d like Republicans to honor their agreement. Sixty-seven is not a majority.” The backstory: Republicans took a temporary 67-66 advantage when DFL Rep.-elect Curtis Johnson resigned his District 40B seat late last month after a district judge determined he didn’t meet the legal residency requirement. Gov. Tim Walz has called a special election for Jan. 28 to replace Johnson. Given the deep blue makeup of the Roseville-area 40B District, Democrats are expected to keep the seat. (Republicans sued Walz over the weekend, arguing the election must be at least 22 days after the beginning of the legislative session, which begins Jan. 14.) Until a Democrat wins 40B, Republicans have a one-seat advantage and are poised to elect their House leader Rep. Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, as the new speaker, when the Legislature convenes next week. Although Republicans need 68 votes to pass laws, they can install a speaker with 67, and Democrats won’t be able to remove her — even after the 40B special election brings the House back into a tie — assuming Republicans stick together as a caucus. Democrats are considering their own maneuver: By not showing up, they can prevent the 68 members required for a quorum to do business. Article 3, Section 13 of the Minnesota Constitution requires that “a majority of each house” — i.e., 68 House members — “constitutes a quorum to transact business.” Two Capitol lobbyists, who were granted anonymity because they’re not authorized to speak publicly, said House Democrats are saying all options are on the table. Two Democratic legislative sources confirmed that the quorum idea is among the options being considered. On the downside, Democrats — especially first-year members — might have a hard time explaining to constituents why they are absent for two weeks during the legislative session. If Democrats are absent, Republicans could use robust measures to force Democrats to appear. The Minnesota Constitution, in requiring 68 members for a quorum, says “a smaller number may … compel the attendance of absent members in the manner and under the penalties it may provide.” Republicans say absent Democrats would also be subject to recall petitions for so-called nonfeasance, or as the statute reads, “the intentional, repeated failure of a state officer … to perform specific acts that are required duties of the officer.” In this case, showing up at the Legislature could be considered a required duty of the office. Republicans dispute Democrats’ interpretation of the constitution’s quorum rule. “The Minnesota Constitution does not set 68 as the quorum…. On January 14, there will be (at most) 133 members of the Minnesota House, so a quorum is 67 members,” wrote Rep. Harry Niska, R-Ramsey, on X. Democrats are also considering a de facto filibuster, eating up clock for the first two weeks of the session, preventing a vote on speakership until the special election brings the chamber back into 67-67 balance. Aside from Demuth winning the speakership and the pomp and privileges it carries, Republicans in the current composition would also be able to claim committee chairmanships, rather than sharing them with Democrats, as had been previously agreed to during power-sharing negotiations in which Demuth and Hortman have been engaged since the November election. A major concern for Democrats is the status of Rep.-elect Brad Tabke, who won a Shakopee-area district by 14 votes. Republicans challenged the election results over 20 missing ballots that were accidentally discarded, and a judge is expected to issue a ruling soon. Regardless of the judiciary ruling, however, the Minnesota Constitution gives the House and Senate the power to seat members and rule on election contests: “Each house shall be the judge of the election returns and eligibility of its own members. The Legislature shall prescribe by law the manner for taking evidence in cases of contested seats in either house.” The statute the Legislature crafted to deal with disputed elections specifically says “a majority of the votes given decides the issue.” (Emphasis added.) In other words, only needing a majority of votes rather than a majority of the 134-member House, Republicans could refuse to seat Tabke with their 1-vote temporary advantage. In that case, Republicans still would not be able to pass any laws without a 68-seat majority, but they’d retain their 1-seat advantage, at least temporarily. By refusing to seat Tabke, Republicans could pressure Walz into calling a special election in that district, which would give Republicans a chance at an actual 68-vote majority. Refusing to provide a quorum has been a common tactic in recent political history, perhaps owing to the nation’s increasing polarization. Texas Democrats hopped on a plane to Washington, D.C. in 2021 to prevent Republicans there from enacting laws Democrats deemed gross violations of voting rights. Oregon Republicans have also used the tactic, though with at-times disastrous results. Another Republican famously sought to prevent a quorum, though he was a Whig at the time: Abraham Lincoln went out a window of Illinois’ temporary legislative chambers in 1840 to prevent a quorum and block Democrats from passing a bill that threatened the state bank. As Snopes reported, “While Lincoln’s escape was dramatic, it was not successful. The quorum stood and the legislation was approved.” Reformer Deputy Editor Max Nesterak contributed reporting.

Staas Haught, USA TODAY NETWORK",2025-01-06T13:38:08.000Z,"If you’re driving into New York to catch a Broadway show, visit Times Square, or grab dinner, be prepared to pay more than just parking fees. New York City’s new congestion pricing program started this week. Now, driving into Manhattan anywhere south of 60th Street and Broadway — Columbus Circle — means another toll. For most drivers, it’s $9 between 5 a.m and 9 p.m. on weekdays. But trucks and bigger vehicles could pay tolls topping $21. And Uber and Lyft rides have surcharges baked into them to offset the congestion pricing. Getting into New York City from New Jersey, Pennsylvania, or Delaware by car will mean paying the new congestion fee. The Congestion Relief Zone covers all of Manhattan below 60th Street — think Midtown, Lower Manhattan, and the neighborhoods where most of NYC’s iconic attractions are located. Times Square; The Statue of Liberty ferry; Broadway theaters: all inside the zone. And the toll is automatic. E-ZPass users will be tolled immediately and cars without a pass will be billed by license plate. There are some ways to avoid the toll, like using FDR Drive or the West Side Highway without stopping in Manhattan. And, of course, the congestion tolls are meant to cut back on the number of cars in the city and encourage public transportation. So, using Amtrak or SEPTA connections to Midtown means no $9 toll.

Here are the most affordable countries I visited.,,Lifestyle,INSIDER,6 min read,"While traveling on $50 a day, I stuck to my budget in only a few places. Here are the most affordable countries I visited, including Peru.",Sarah Bence,2025-01-06T16:48:39.000Z,"I spent 17 months traveling with my partner while trying to stick to a budget of about $50 a day. My budget kept me on track for the first three months, in part because Peru felt affordable. I definitely spent more in countries known for being expensive to visit, like Japan and Singapore. After saving up for years, my partner and I spent 17 months traveling around the world. We started our trip in Peru and traveled north to Mexico before heading to Asia. Since my partner is an accountant, we thought it would be useful to track every expense along the way. My initial budget was $1,500 a month or roughly $50 a day. He had the same budget, but we kept our money separate. Here's what it was like exploring multiple countries while trying to manage my spending. We spent the first two months in Peru, where I spent $1,370.29 in July and $1,179.96 in August. Of all the countries we visited, I found Peru had some of the lowest prices for things like food and accommodations. Our real key to staying under budget the first few months, though, was traveling at a slow pace. We took long bus journeys instead of quick, pricey flights and got deals on accommodations for staying longer. We also frequently cooked for ourselves and didn't book any expensive tours or activities. I also stayed under budget in September, which we spent in Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia. I spent $1,325.07, with a daily average of $33.35 in Peru and $45.60 in Ecuador. Colombia was more expensive for me at an average of $57 a day, but we spent only a few days there at the end of the month. While exploring Central America, I didn't go over my monthly budget of $1,500 by too much. One month I spent $1,646, and another $1,888. My daily spend was below $50 in El Salvador ($38.70) and Costa Rica ($33.09). To be fair, though, my Costa Rica budget is skewed because my parents visited and paid for our accommodation for 10 days as our joint Christmas and birthday presents. Without their gift, I would've spent way more. I thought El Salvador, on the other hand, felt extremely affordable, but I spent only 12 days there. I wish I'd stayed longer — both for my wallet and because I enjoyed the people, scenery, and food (pupusas forever!). I also went over my daily budget — but only slightly — while visiting Colombia ($57), Honduras ($58.41), Nicaragua ($53.43), Guatemala ($62.72), and Vietnam ($54.23). Looking back, I think I could've stayed under budget in those places if I'd tried harder or reorganized my itinerary. Cutting out pricey experiences like the motorbiking trip in Vietnam or the overnight volcano hike in Guatemala would've lowered my expenses — but those felt like once-in-a-lifetime opportunities I couldn't pass up. I also could've saved a significant amount by booking cheaper accommodations like hostel dorms, but the longer we traveled the more we opted for more comfortable (often pricier) stays like Airbnbs or private hostel rooms. Splitting accomodation costs between the two of us helped — I couldn't have justified the upgrades as a solo traveler — but we rarely chose the cheapest options. In March, I spent $3,076.75 across Belize and Mexico — double my monthly budget. I splurged on some experiences, like a snorkel tour in Belize and a mezcal tasting in Oaxaca, but the average prices for just about everything were higher than I expected. Though I overspent, I still refrained from certain activities, like a $125 cave tour in Belize, because I wanted to try to stay close to my budget. Looking back, I wish I'd just spent the money. In Indonesia, I spent $109.96 a day, which might seem high for a country that has a reputation for affordability, though I spent five days on its island of Sumatra on orangutan trekking tours. My flights, transport, and tours were expensive for that short amount of time, but it was one of my most memorable experiences. Before I left, I knew I'd likely exceed my budget in some countries that are known for being expensive to visit. My average daily spend in Panama was $98.38. My food and accommodations there were on the pricey side, and I also splurged on a five-day sailboat trip from Colombia to get there. (The alternative was an equally expensive flight, which was how I justified it.) I also knew Singapore would be expensive, so I limited myself to six days there across two separate layovers. I stayed in hostel dorms or used credit-card points for hotels and mostly did free activities. My spending in Singapore still came out to $95.74 a day. Finally, the most expensive country I visited was also my favorite: Japan. I spent an average of $121.79 a day, or $3,288.28 across 27 days — aka more than double my monthly budget. Traveling for this long was incredible, and it wouldn't have been possible without my budget. Daily and monthly spending goals helped me keep my spending in check. Setting a conservative budget, having savings separate from the money I'd set aside for this trip, and earning some cash along the way meant I didn't stress too much when I went over budget. Looking back, I could've rearranged my itinerary to spend more time in countries where I spent less, but ultimately I don't have any significant regrets. In fact, my advice would be to splurge on bucket-list activities (within reason) — I'll never forget seeing wild orangutans in Indonesia or learning to make sushi in Japan. Money can come back, but memories are forever. Read the original article on Business Insider",0,[],2025-01-06 14:40:11,2025-01-06 19:20:54

Today, 3,800 killed or wounded,"" he told podcaster Lex Fridman, but he cautioned that North Korea could send many more, giving a figure as high as half a million troops. Estimates of North Korean casualties have varied since intelligence agencies reported in October that it was sending troops to help Russian President Vladimir Putin defend territory seized by Ukraine in the summer. In late December, the White House estimated that more than 1,000 North Koreans had been killed or wounded in the space of a single week, amid mass dismounted attacks. And in his nightly address on Saturday, Zelenskyy said that the Russian army had lost ""up to a battalion of infantry, including North Korean soldiers and Russian paratroopers,"" in fighting in the village of Makhnovka in Kursk. Zelenskyy offered the latest casualty figures as part of a broader argument about the dangers to Europe if the US retreats from NATO. President-elect Donald Trump has long been critical of NATO and the defense spending of some of its members, leading to concerns that he could slash support for the alliance or even walk away. Zelenskyy said that if Trump decides to leave NATO once back in office, ""Putin will destroy Europe."" He also argued that European countries are much less willing and able to raise massive armies compared to an autocracy like North Korea. While Ukraine has around 980,000 military personnel, the militaries of its European allies are a fraction of the size, Zelenskyy said. ""Can Europe bring people together? No,"" he said. ""Will Europe be able to build an army consisting of two to three million people? No, Europe will not want to do this."" Dmytro Ponomarenko, Ukraine's ambassador to South Korea, told Voice of America in November that the number of North Korean troops aiding Russia could soon reach 15,000, with troops rotated out every two to three months. That could mean about 100,000 North Korean soldiers serving in Russia within a year, he added. Read the original article on Business Insider",52,[],2025-01-06 14:40:11,2025-01-06 20:25:26

SISAK,2025-01-06T14:34:43.000Z,"NEW YORK (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump asked a judge Monday to halt this week’s sentencing in his hush money case while they appeal his recent rulings upholding the verdict. Trump’s lawyers said they plan to ask a state appeals court to reverse Judge Juan M. Merchan's decision last week, which set the case for sentencing on Friday — little over a week before he’s sworn in for his second term. In a pair of rulings in recent weeks, Merchan rejected Trump’s bid to throw out the verdict and dismiss the indictment on presidential immunity grounds and because of his impending return to the White House. See for yourself — The Yodel is the go-to source for daily news, entertainment and feel-good stories. By signing up, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Policy. In a decision last week, the judge signaled he is not likely to sentence Trump, a Republican, to any punishment for his historic conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. Acknowledging the demands of the transition process, he had given Trump the option to attend in person or appear virtually by video. Trump’s lawyers argued in court papers Monday that their planned appeal to the Appellate Division of the state’s trial court triggers what’s known as an automatic stay, or pause, in the proceedings. If that doesn’t happen, they argued, Merchan should then grant a pause and prevent sentencing from happening on Friday as scheduled. “Today, President Trump’s legal team moved to stop the unlawful sentencing in the Manhattan D.A.’s Witch Hunt,"" Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung said. “The Supreme Court’s historic decision on Immunity, the state constitution of New York, and other established legal precedent mandate that this meritless hoax be immediately dismissed.” A message seeking comment was left for the Manhattan district attorney's office, which prosecuted the case. While Trump asserted that presidential immunity and his looming second term necessitated nixing the verdict, Merchan wrote in his Jan. 3 ruling that only “bringing finality to this matter” by sentencing Trump would serve the interests of justice. The judge wrote that sentencing Trump to what’s known as an unconditional discharge — closing the case without jail time, a fine or probation — “appears to be the most viable solution.” Trump will have an opportunity to speak at his sentencing, as will his lawyers and prosecutors. Once he is sentenced, he can appeal the verdict, as he has vowed to do. Trump is on course to be the first president to take office convicted of felony crimes. In a social media post, he said it “would be the end of the Presidency as we know it” if the judge’s ruling upholding the May 30 verdict is allowed to stand. The charges involved an alleged scheme to hide a hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the last weeks of Trump’s 2016 campaign to keep her from publicizing claims she’d had sex with him years earlier. He says that her story is false and that he did nothing wrong. The case centered on how Trump accounted for reimbursing his then-personal lawyer Michael Cohen, who had made the payment to Daniels. The conviction carried the possibility of punishment ranging from a fine or probation to up to four years in prison. Cohen, a key prosecution witness who had previously called for Trump to be put in prison, said that “based upon all of the intervening circumstances” Merchan’s decision to sentence Trump without punishment “ Trump’s sentencing initially was set for last July 11, then postponed twice at the defense’s request. After Trump’s Nov. 5 election, Merchan delayed the sentencing again so the defense and prosecution could weigh in on the future of the case.",890,[],2025-01-06 14:45:02,2025-01-06 20:26:49

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) jumped around 1% in afternoon trade, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains, surging around 1.5%, after a tech-led rally on Friday. The upbeat mood kicks off the first full week of 2025 for traders, highlighted by the release of the December nonfarm-payrolls report on Friday. But it's another shortened week, as stock markets shutter on Thursday to mourn the death of former President Jimmy Carter. Chip stocks are rallying after a record revenue and a strong sales forecast from Nvidia (NVDA) server partner Foxconn (2317.TW, HNHPF), which boosted optimism for AI-fueled growth. Shares of Nvidia climbed almost 5%, putting the stock on pace for a record close, while peer Micron Technology (MU) rose over 10%. The focus will stay on Nvidia later on Monday when CEO Jensen Huang gives the keynote speech to start the CES tech conference. Investors will listen for signs its new Blackwell chip has shaken off supply glitches. Meanwhile, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) was up around two basis points to hover around 4.61% after the Washington Post reported that President-elect Donald Trump's team is exploring more limited tariffs than anticipated. At the same time, the dollar (DX=F) dropped sharply as markets recalculated the potential inflationary impact of the incoming president's plans. The index later pared some of its losses after Trump called the Washington Post report ""wrong"" in a social media post. On the corporate front, Disney (DIS) confirmed it will combine its Hulu + Live TV business with sports streamer FuboTV (FUBO) in the first major media dealmaking move of 2025. Fubo shares soared over 200%, while shares in Disney climbed around 1%. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices traded above $101,000 a token. It's the first time the leading cryptocurrency has topped $100,000 since Dec. 19. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: The Federal Reserve’s top banking regulator Michael Barr will step down from his position in February, saying that ""the risk of a dispute over the position could be a distraction from our mission."" Fed watchers expected President-elect Donald Trump to demote Barr, who was a Joe Biden appointee and a Treasury official during the Barack Obama era, although it was not clear that Trump would have had the legal power to make such a move once he took office. Barr himself said in November he wouldn’t leave as the Fed's vice chair of supervision before his term was up even if Trump tried to fire him, saying ""I intend to serve my fixed term of office."" Barr's term as vice chair for supervision was scheduled to end in July 2026. Barr backed off from that potential fight Monday, in a surprise move. However, he said that he would remain on the Fed board of governors, a separate term that doesn't end until 2032. Barr's boss, Jerome Powell, has reinforced his intention to serve out his term as chair through May 2026, telling reporters he didn’t intend to go anywhere even if Trump tried to fire or demote him. Barr's departure comes as the people in Trump’s orbit are floating some dramatic ideas that would remake the way US banks are regulated during the next Trump administration, from deleting the CFPB to abolishing the FDIC. There are lots of questions about whether any of the ideas, some of which would require acts of Congress, will come to pass. Read more here. Nvidia (NVDA) stock extended last week's gains, with shares set to surpass their previous all-time closing high. The stock climbed nearly 5% to trade at around $151. The chip marker reached its previous record close of $148.88 a share on Nov. 7. The positive swings come as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is set to deliver a keynote address at the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas at 6:20 p.m. PST on Monday. The address will be livestreamed on Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, and other sites. Investors are anticipating more updates on the rollout of the company's Blackwell chips, which analysts say will drive a massive new cycle of demand despite fears over an AI spending slowdown. Read more here. The US dollar index (DX-Y.NYB) moved lower, coming off its recent two-year high on Monday after the Washington Post reported that President-elect Donald Trump's tariff plans could be less broad than initially thought. Trump quickly responded on Truth Social, saying the report was ""wrong."" The US dollar index (DX-Y.NYB), which had been down as much as 1%, pared some losses and was off about 0.5% at last check. Both the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) stock indexes were up more than 1%. In a note to clients late Sunday, Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson wrote that the dollar index has risen to a level that ""has the potential to weigh on equities with more significant foreign sales exposure."" As noted last week, that group includes many of the key companies driving the lion's share of S&P 500 earnings growth. This, combined with the recent rise in the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) to 4.6%, could be a headwind for the broadening of the stock market rally beyond just large-cap tech stocks, per Wilson. Should the rise in rates and the dollar persist, Wilson argues that ""2025 could be a year of two halves, with the first half being more challenged before potential equity-market-friendly policy changes (tax cut extensions/expansions, government efficiency reduces the term premium, etc.) can have their desired effects."" The Canadian dollar strengthened against its US counterpart on Monday after Canadian Prime Minister and Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau formally announced his resignation. “I intend to resign as party leader and as prime minister after the party selects a new leader,” Trudeau said in a scheduled appearance in Ottawa. Pressure has mounted in recent weeks as the country's party leaders debate how to best handle US President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tariff threat on Canada. Trudeau's Liberal Party has also lagged behind the opposition Conservative Party in opinion polls. Last month, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland resigned from her position, citing internal struggles between herself and Trudeau on the best path forward for Canada. She added the country can “ill afford” Trump's tariff threats. The two countries are each other's biggest trading parters, and Trump has vowed to increase import tariffs on Canadian goods by 25%. Given Trudeau's resignation timeline, he will continue to serve as prime minister during the first few month's of Trump's presidency and will manage tariff talks during that time. Chip stocks rose across the board Monday after Taiwanese electronics contract manufacturer Foxconn reported December sales ahead of analyst expectations. The PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX) rose more than 3%, ahead of the Nasdaq's (^IXIC) near 2% gain and the S&P 500's (^GSPC) roughly 1% climb. Memory chipmaker Micron (MU) jumped 11%, while Broadcom (AVGO) rose almost 3% and Qualcomm (QCOM) ticked up close to 2%. Nvidia (NVDA) was up nearly 5% mid-morning, while AMD (AMD) climbed more than 2%. Foxconn assembles Apple's iPhones and data center servers for hyperscalers such as Google (GOOG) and Amazon (AMZN) using the world's most advanced chips such as Nvidia's. Foxconn on Sunday reported December sales of NT$654.8 billion ($20 billion), a 40% increase from the prior year and 7% higher than consensus estimates, Citi analyst Carrie Liu told investors in a note. Foxconn's performance is seen as an indicator for the chip sector because it manufactures products that need those chips to function. Nvidia stock was also boosted by investors looking ahead to CEO Jensen Huang's keynote address at the CES trade show in Las Vegas. Read more on that here. Disney (DIS) will combine its Hulu + Live TV business with sports streamer FuboTV (FUBO) in the first major media-dealmaking move of 2025. Disney will control 70% of Fubo, according to a statement. Shareholders of the sports streamer will own the remaining 30% of the combined business, which will operate under the Fubo publicly traded company name. In conjunction with the transaction, Fubo settled all litigation with Disney, Fox (FOX), and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) related to Venu Sports, the planned sports streaming platform previously announced by the trio. Shares of Fubo surged over 100% in early trading Monday on the heels of the announcement. Disney, Fox, and WBD shares were all up about 1%. The combination of the two businesses will create one of the largest digital pay-TV providers in the US as consumers search for cable alternatives amid increased cord-cutting. Fubo, which offers people access to live TV channels over the internet, has primarily focused on sports and news. Hulu + Live TV, categorized as a cable replacement option — similar to YouTube TV — allows audiences to stream from about 100 live TV channels across sports, news, and entertainment. On an investor call, Fubo said the combined company is expected to ""become immediately cash flow positive,"" with over 6.2 million subscribers in North America and over $6 billion in revenue.

This marked the first time the leading cryptocurrency has topped $100,000 since Dec. 19. Nvidia (NVDA) shares have been pushing higher into CEO Jensen Huang's CES keynote speech around 9:30 p.m. ET today. The question is whether the gains will be sustained once Huang has spoken. Bank of America semiconductor sector analyst Vivek Arya seems to think the keynote will be a springboard for further Nvidia gains. Here's what Arya said in a note this AM: ""We still see CES as a positive catalyst, re-asserting NVDA's platform dominance/opportunity in high-growth markets. Specifically, we look for updates on: 1) Robotics strategy (Jetson Thor) from silicon to software and emergence of ""physical AI"" theme, 2) Launch of RTX 50xx, Blackwell variants of PC gaming cards with enhanced ""neural rendering"" and faster GDDR7 memory, 3) Potential entry into AI PC likely via partnership or (small) chance of standalone PC CPU, and 4) Update on data center including current-gen Blackwell (GB200, B200), second half upgraded variants (GB300, B300 - more memory (288GB using 12 stack High HBM 3E) for more accurate AI inference) and teaser on next-gen Rubin (CY26E)."" Arya reiterated a Buy"" rating on Nvidia's stock with a very bullish price target of $190 per share. Stocks continued to build a strong start to the new year on Monday morning. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.8%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains, popping 1.2%, after a tech-led rally on Friday. Tech led the charge in early trading, with shares of Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) rising more than 2% and Micron (MU) shooting higher by more than 9%. The chip names rallied after a record revenue and a strong sales forecast from Nvidia (NVDA) server partner Foxconn (2317.TW, HNHPF), which boosted optimism for AI-fueled growth.

Elon Musk is standing in the way as Jeff Bezos reaches for orbit The first full week of trading in 2025 was set to begin with US stocks higher after a report from the Washington Post suggested a softening in Trump's tariff plans could be coming as his administration takes power this month. As The Post's Jeff Stein reports: ""[Trump's] aides are still discussing plans to impose import duties on goods from every country, the people said. But rather than apply tariffs to all imports, the current discussions center on imposing them only on certain sectors deemed critical to national or economic security..."" After his election win in the fall, Trump pledged to impose a blanket tariff of up to 20% on all imports — from all trading partners — with even stiffer levies targeted at some countries, like Mexico, Canada, and China. The stock market's shaky finish to 2024 was, in part, attributable to the uncertainty of these policies and Trump's broader economic agenda heading into 2025. Last month, the Fed revised its outlook for rate cuts in 2025, with Chair Jay Powell saying during a press conference that the impact of Trump's tariffs during his first administration — which prompted a more aggressive interest rate hiking cycle and a market sell-off in 2018 — was ""a good starting point"" for thinking about Trump 2.0. Ahead of Monday's open, futures on the tech-heavy Nasdaq were up about 1% while S&P 500 futures rose 0.8%. Dow futures were up closer to 0.4%. The dollar index, which has traded to two-year highs since Trump's election win, was off about 1% early Monday.",267,[],2025-01-06 14:46:00,2025-01-09 00:32:38

According to veteran NBA reporter Chris Haynes, Phoenix is benching starters Bradley Beal and Jusuf Nurkić after losing seven of their past eight games, a stretch that has lowered their record to 15-18. Rookie wing Ryan Dunn and veteran big man Mason Plumlee will replace the pair in the starting lineup. The lineup will get its first look on Monday against the Philadelphia 76ers. The move is an admission that the Suns' would-be superteam featuring Kevin Durant and Devin Booker is nowhere close to materializing, and Beal and Nurkić were the easy levers to pull. Both players' stats are well down from their marks last year, but what's most telling is that while the Suns have been outscored by 1.9 points per 100 possessions so far this season, they've been outscored by 8.7 points when Beal is on the floor and by 4.7 points with Nurkić. Both players have been valuable for other teams in the past, but have looked like shells of themselves recently. The problem for the Suns is those two players plus Durant and Booker represent 77.5% of their team payroll this season — and 120% of their cap space. The rest of their team represents what they can afford on a shoestring budget, meaning any significant change for the better will have to come from a) the players they already have or b) a trade. There has been no shortage of trade speculation involving the Suns, especially around Beal. Miami Heat star Jimmy Butler, currently suspended seven games for all but screaming he wants a trade, has been a popular idea, but the Suns would still need to get Beal to waive his no-trade clause and find another team to make the finances work, because the Heat reportedly don't want anything to do with Beal's supermax contract. The Suns' chest of draft picks is relatively bare after the trades for Durant and Beal, and further enhancing the roster would mean emptying it further. It's an unenviable situation for a team when a trio of expensive superstars just doesn't work, and Phoenix is trying to work through it now.",87,[],2025-01-06 14:48:01,2025-01-09 00:32:42

The Las Vegas Raiders tight end officially broke the NFL’s rookie receptions record on Sunday in their 34-20 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers. That broke a tie with New York Giants wide receiver Malik Nabers and gave Bowers the record back after he set it just last week. The former Georgia standout hauled in his 110th catch of the season in the third quarter of the contest at Allegiant Stadium when quarterback Aidan O’Connell found him wide open in the middle of the field for a 21-yard gain.

Nabers had five catches in the Giants’ season-ending loss in the early wave of games on Sunday, which moved him past Bowers briefly on the list. Bowers, however, needed just two catches to hit the mark and take sole possession of the record back. He actually broke Puka Nacua’s mark of 105 receptions last week, though he has been in lockstep with Nabers for weeks. Before Bowers and Nabers, only three other players in league history had made more than 100 catches during their rookie campaigns. Though he will take home the rookie record, Bowers will finish just shy of the league's single-season receptions record for a tight end. Former Philadelphia Eagles star Zach Ertz set the mark with 116 catches in 2018. Bowers did move into second on that list with his catch in the third quarter. Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce had a career-high 110 catches during the 2022 campaign. Bowers finished with four catches for 50 yards and a touchdown in Sunday's loss, which gave him 112 on the year. His score came in the final seconds, though the Raiders were too far behind for it to make a difference. It was the fifth touchdown of Bowers' career. Brock Bowers TD!

There aren't any big surprises with these chips, but if you were eyeing the Core Ultra 200V AI chips, but wanted something with a bit more horsepower, the 200H and 200HX are exactly what you're looking for. The Core Ultra 200H family tops out with the Core Ultra 9 285H processor, which offers 16 cores (six performance, eight efficient and two low-power) and a top speed of 5.4GHz. It also sports 8 Intel Arc GPU cores, which is enough to play some smaller titles. The Core Ultra 200HX family adds more cores to make them better suited to games and high-intensity workloads. The high-end Core Ultra 9 285HX has 24 cores (eight performance and 16 efficient) and a maximum speed of 5.5GHz. While it offers only 4 Intel GPU cores, it's not meant much to game much on its own. Instead, it'll be paired up with discrete GPUs from NVIDIA or AMD in gaming laptops. Intel didn't have many other details to share on these chips, other than the fact that we can expect to see systems featuring them sometime in the first quarter. That's also when desktops powered by the Core Ultra 200S chips start shipping. But hey, it's CES, and AMD almost certainly has its own chip refresh in tow. Intel had to announce something, otherwise all we'd be talking about is how much trouble the company is in following the ouster of former CEO Pat Gelsinger.",0,[],2025-01-06 14:48:36,2025-01-06 21:55:19

It also costs anywhere from $2,500 to $3,000.",lawrence bonk,2025-01-06T14:01:00.000Z,"Swimming is one of my favorite things in the whole world. Cleaning a pool, however, is an absolute drag. For my money, pool-cleaning robots are much handier than even standard robovacs. If you have access to a pool, the forthcoming Wybot S3 could ensure you never have to walk around like a doofus with an oversized net ever again. Announced at CES, the Wybot S3 is an improvement over the S2 in nearly every way. The company says it’s the “first self-docking, self-emptying automatic charging pool cleaning robot.” It includes an automated self-emptying system, which is standard with land-based robovacs but new to water-adjacent models. The unit transfers debris from its body to a 10-liter above ground base station. This bin is big enough to go 30 days without having to be manually emptied. Another first? The robot charges itself automatically via integrated solar panels. Under optimal sunlight, it’ll suck up around 1.5 hours of runtime per day. If the weather is less than ideal, the unit can also be charged by plugging into a traditional power outlet. As for the actual cleaning, the unit includes a whole bunch of sensors that help it create a 3D map of the entire “underwater environment.” This lets it plan the most efficient cleaning route and minimizes the chances of blind spots. The company says this is particularly important for irregularly shaped pools. It also comes with a camera that susses out the largest amounts of debris, for improved efficiency and accuracy. The Wybot S3 can be monitored and controlled in real-time via a proprietary app, with a connection that combines Wi-Fi and sonar. The aquatic robovac is available for preorder right now, with shipments going out in the second quarter of the year. However, all of that waterproof tech is gonna cost you. The robot will be priced between $2,500 and $3,000, depending on which options are selected. Pool cleaning robots have been popping up all over the place lately. A company called Aiper brought an impressive model to CES back in 2023 and the Beatbot Aquasense Pro has been receiving rave reviews.",0,[],2025-01-06 14:48:36,2025-01-06 21:55:32

Happier than ever, Fogle is returning to our screens in the next series of New Lives in the Wild which follows brave individuals who decide to live off-grid. The 50-year-old adventurer become a big name after appearing on Castaway, where he was marooned on a desert island for a year in a social reality TV experiment in 2000. Fogle — who compromised on his off-grid living dream — previously told Yahoo of the upcoming New Lives in the Wild series: ""The standout of this new series is the family who moved to Bulgaria. They bought a house, sight unseen, and moved there. Prepare to be moved to tears at their incredible story."" View this post on Instagram A post shared by Channel 5 (@channel5_tv) Lewis and Jordan pulled the plug on their wedding plans to move their young family to a plot of land they bought on the internet in Bulgaria. Initially arriving in the town where they bought the home, Jordan worried, ""What the f*** have we done?"" The couple invited Fogle to film their extraordinary life at the two-storey farmhouse, built in the 50s, for reality adventure series New Lives in the Wild. They were just two ordinary people born in Bournemouth in the early 90s who fell in love while living on neighbouring council estates; and at 19 had their first child Leo before going onto work a variety of jobs. The journalist told their story to the camera: ""Behind the smiles, this young family were struggling to make ends meet. In their small council house, they dreamt of another life where they could rear animals and grow their own food. ""In 2022, they saw the opportunity in the form of a run-down property in rural Bulgaria on the market for just £7,000. They cancelled the wedding they had been saving for. They bought the place sight unseen, moving to a country they never visited with little idea of what they would find."" New Lives in the Wild captured the amazing stories of individuals who courageously leave behind the rat race to live a simpler life. The latest series has 14 locations from all over the world including Morocco, Australia and Botswana. ""It's bigger and better than ever before,"" Fogle wrote on Instagram. ""14 inspiring stories that will leave you spellbound and sometimes a little tearful. It had been such a privilege meeting some of the most inspiring people, chasing their dreams and pursuing happiness through the simplicity of the wilderness."" The new series airs on Channel 5 on Tuesday 7 January. Fogle previously told Yahoo of the series: ""We try to find a perfect mix of location, story and character. If we can combine all three then we have a winner."" View this post on Instagram A post shared by Ben Fogle (@benfogle) The strangers welcome Fogle into their lives in the wild, thanks to his own openness and vulnerability. He added: ""I have always valued authenticity. I have always worn my heart on my sleeve. The show is about them. It makes sure they trust me. We aren’t there to stitch anyone up. So much TV is ‘gotcha’ television. Trying to catch people out or criticise. I have never done that. I am not there to judge, but [for them] to share their unique story."" The series has been running for 13 years. It follows on from the most recent series of New Lives in the Wild that ran late last year, focusing on revisiting individuals that Fogle had met with in the past including fan favourite Bette in Queensland. Inspired by those magical stories, Fogle said he would dream of moving his family to the wilderness but now realises they are very happy at their home in South Oxfordshire. He told Good Morning Britain: ""My whole family used to dread me coming home (from filming). I'd come home from some of the remotest places, the Falkland Islands, Antarctica and I am a very enthusiastic person. ""I'd say, we are going to move as a family, I've found a little island. I still have that positivity and excitement but I've measured it a little bit to realise that (my family are) very happy in South Oxfordshire where they are now.""

Adrien Brody's work on The Brutalist ultimately beat out Chalamet's performance as Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown. Chalamet has been showered with praise for his performance in the film, which follows a young Dylan as he arrives in New York City in the early 1960s and befriends folk singers Pete Seeger and Woody Guthrie. It then traces his rise to the top, culminating in his infamous performance with electric instruments at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. Globes voters preferred Brody's performance as an architect and Holocaust survivor in The Brutalist, with Brody winning the award for Best Actor in a Drama ahead of Chalamet. Popular fan account Club Chalamet was among those who chimed in to criticise the Globes and the voters for their decision. In the wake of the ceremony, they wrote on X (formerly Twitter) that ""the fourth nomination was not the charm"" for Chalamet. They added: ""Timmy didn't win, again, and the Golden Globes got what they wanted from him, jokes, and his face on the camera, in this seat. This sucks.""

They said: ""But, there are more award opportunities coming from even more worthy awards. Remember, a lot of Golden Globes winners do not get nominated at the Oscars, or win.

Chalamet was the butt of several jokes from Globes host Nikki Glaser in her well-received opening monologue. ""You have the most gorgeous eyelashes... on your upper lip,"" she said in a reference to the 29-year-old star's new facial hair.

Nominated for best performance by a female actor in a television series drama for her work on Matlock, Bates, 76, looked radiant as ever and debuted a trendy new look at Sunday's ceremony where she hit the carpet in chic trousers and sneakers! Bates turned heads in a beautifully beaded dinner jacket that cinched at her waist teamed with black tuxedo pants and sparkling evening bag. She styled her silver tresses in retro half-up style with lots of bounce. And her choice of footwear also had People Style Editors talking (it looks like she's wearing Sneex — a sneaker-heel hybrid from Spanx founder Sara Blakely.) Amy Sussman/Getty Receiving nominations in the same category as Bates are Emma D’Arcy (House of the Dragon), Maya Erskine (Mr. and Mrs. Smith), Keira Knightley (Black Doves), Keri Russell (The Diplomat), and Anna Sawai (Shōgun) this year. Bates's unforgettable red carpet appearance comes after she showed off her 100 lb. weight loss, which she accomplished over seven years, at the 2024 Emmys on Sept. 15. The Office alum wore a deep purple gown with black beading from Giorgio Armani, a black purse, and pointed heels for the event. Speaking about her experience finding her outfit of the night, she told PEOPLE that she and her friend who had joined her for the fitting ""were in tears because everything I came out in just looked exquisite.""

We had a wonderful little skit with Antony [Starr] and Giancarlo [Esposito]. It was a lovely night. That evening was really special,"" she said. Bates has been very open about her weight loss journey. She shared with PEOPLE that she first lost 80 pounds due to lifestyle and diet changes. She then lost another 20 pounds on Ozempic. Paul Archuleta/Getty Bates said that she was inspired to get serious about her health when she was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes around 2017. “There's been a lot of talk that I just was able to do this because of Ozempic. But I have to impress upon people out there that this was hard work for me, especially during the pandemic,"" she said. ""It's very hard to say you’ve had enough."" The actress is not a newcomer to the Golden Globes. She won her first Golden Globe at the 1991 ceremony for best performance by an actress in a motion picture drama for Misery. For the 48th Golden Globe Awards, she wore a chic black dress with silver and white beadwork. Although she would go on to receive additional nominations years after, her second Golden Globe came in 1997 when she won for best performance by an actress in a supporting role in a series, limited series or motion picture made for television category for her work on The Late Shift.

Taking to the stage to present the award for film cinematic and box office achievement, Diesel spotted Johnson and gave a small wave. “Hey Dwayne,” he said pointedly, with a small chuckle. The WWE star smiled briefly but quickly turned more icy as other members of the Beverly Hills Hilton audience began to laugh at the tangible discomfort. Johnson played Luke Hobbs in five films across the popular action franchise, including his own 2019 spin-off Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw opposite Jason Statham. In recent years, he and Diesel had been engaged in a public falling out, resulting in his absence from F9 and Fast X in 2023. However, writing on X in June 2023, Johnson announced that a new Hobbs movie was currently in the works, and said that he and Diesel had “put all the past behind us.” Hope you’ve got your funderwear on… HOBBS IS BACK.

Oh my gosh… Amazing haha.” The feud between Johnson and Diesel was made public in 2016, when Johnson shared an inflammatory Instagram post aimed at an unnamed co-star, later confirmed by him to be Diesel. “Some conduct themselves as stand up men and true professionals, while others don’t,” he wrote. “The ones that don’t are too chicken s*** to do anything about it anyway.

The Rock, meanwhile, seemed nonplussed and smiled back at his co-star, prompting some hesitant laughs from their peers in the crowd. Johnson and Diesel famously starred together in the Fast and Furious franchise, with Johnson’s appearances stretching from the fifth film to some later spinoffs, but it was around the eighth installment when rumors of a feud between the two actors started coming to light. At the time, a source close to the production of the eighth film, The Fate of the Furious, told People magazine that tensions between Johnson and Diesel had been “building up for months.” “Vin has been having problems with The Rock because The Rock keeps showing up late for production,” the source explained. “Sometimes he doesn’t show up at all, and he’s delaying the production.” The insider’s remarks came after an incident in which Johnson seemingly shaded Diesel in a since-deleted 2016 Instagram post where he wrote, “There’s no other franchise that gets my blood boiling more than this one.” “My female costars are always amazing and I love ’em. My male costars, however, are a different story.

I wasn’t in favor of the move and never felt at home in the new city, but I tried to make the best of it. We struggled financially the entire time because of the recession and our large mortgage. I met some nice people but made only one real friend, who I’ll call “Gayle.” Three years ago, I convinced my husband we should move somewhere else so we could retire and be more financially secure. We compromised, but it is still far from my old hometown. I have tried hard to stay connected to Gayle. When I reach out to her, she responds, but usually with only a few sentences and often complaining about her own circumstances. She never reaches out to me or asks about me and never tries to extend the conversation. I know from experience that Gayle’s not happy, and I worry because I think she might be drinking too much. I’m sad that she doesn’t seem to want to stay connected, but it’s painful to keep reaching out and getting so little back. I’m tired of trying but unsure if I should tell her how I feel or just give up. Please advise. –– LONELY AND FAR FROM HOME DEAR LONELY: Some relationships are situational. You can’t do all the work of maintaining a long-distance friendship if Gayle isn’t willing to put forth some effort. All you will get is more frustration. You have referred twice in your letter to your original hometown, but if you were to visit there, you might find that your old friends have moved on in their lives and the period of life you yearn for cannot be replicated. That’s why it may be time to devote your energy to starting new activities in your new community. From that will come new relationships and possibly new friendships. DEAR ABBY: I have one sister and three younger half-sisters, all of whom I love. Recently, two of my nieces, the daughters of one of my half-sisters, gave birth within months of each other. Both decided to name their babies after their grandparents. One was named after my stepfather, which left me dismayed because I do not love or respect him. In fact, I hate him. My stepfather was an alcoholic who molested my sister and was physically abusive to me when we were growing up. Yet he was loving and protective of his own daughters, my half-sisters. I don’t believe my nieces are aware of this. My stepfather died before my nieces were born, so they never knew him. I truly cannot bear to call the baby by his given name. I kept this to myself, but my sister noticed that I avoid using the baby’s name and has confided in me the very same feelings. If she noticed, perhaps my half-sisters have noticed as well. I don’t want this to end up causing a family rift, but when I hear somebody use the name, I literally start to shake. I thought my stepfather was out of my life forever when he died. How should my sister and I deal with this? Can we make up our own nickname? Currently, we both refer to the baby simply as “Baby.” — NAME-HATER IN THE MIDWEST DEAR NAME-HATER: Yes, you certainly can do that, and you could also tell your half-sisters and nieces the reason why. Beyond that, make an effort to move past this. If you and your sister haven’t received counseling for the abuse you endured from your late stepfather, it may help.

This year, the presidential inauguration lands on a federal holiday, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, and will take place in front of the U.S. Capitol in Washington D.C. Here's what to know about the inauguration: The inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump is set to take place Monday, Jan. 20. The event starts with a procession to the U.S. Capitol for the swearing-in ceremony. Historically, the outgoing president accompanies the president-elect, according to the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies (JCCIC). The president and vice president will have a swearing-in ceremony, followed by an inaugural address. After an honorary departure, the president will head to the President's Room just off the Senate Chamber in the U.S. Capitol for a signing ceremony. Other events include a luncheon and a procession of ceremonial military regiments, marching bands and floats down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. Each member of Congress will receive a limited allotment of tickets to share with constituents. To find and contact your members of Congress, use the search function on USA.gov.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/help-god-christian-nationalism-shaped-143508746.html,'So help me God': How Christian nationalism shaped the presidential oath of office,,Opinion,United Press International,5 min read,Christian nationalism had a lasting impact on the presidential oath of office: There is no evidence George Washington added the phrase more than 200 years ago.,"David B. Parker, Kennesaw State University",2025-01-06T14:35:08.000Z,"On Jan. 20, Donald Trump will take the presidential oath of office: ""I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."" And then he will probably add the phrase ""so help me God."" Those four little words are not in the Constitution, but for many Americans, the phrase has been a part of the oath ever since George Washington was said to have added it 236 years ago. But did Washington really say ""so help me God?"" There is no evidence that he did. In fact, no one said he did until 1854, 65 years later, when Rufus Griswold, an editor and literary critic, told the story in a book titled The Republican Court: ""[Washington] added, with fervor, his eyes closed, that his whole soul might be absorbed in the supplication, 'So help me God!'"" As a professor of U.S. history, I don't care if Washington said it or not; my interest is in how quickly ""so help me God"" became established in the American national memory. For a 2014 article titled ""In Griswold We Trust,"" I used various online databases such as Google Books, Internet Archive, American Periodicals Series and Newspapers.com to search for the phrase. Before 1854, there are no accounts of Washington saying ""so help me God"" at the end of the oath -- at least in the millions of print records covered by the databases. Then Griswold told the story, and by the end of the 1850s, almost a dozen books and magazine articles had repeated it. Griswold's story was so thoroughly accepted that, through the 20th century, no one, including academic scholars, thought to question it. The best way to understand Griswold's mythic insertion of ""so help me God"" into the presidential oath is through the lens of Christian nationalism. While the phrase is relatively new, Christian nationalism itself has been around for a long time. Second Great Awakening Scholars Andrew Whitehead and Samuel Perry have defined Christian nationalism as ""a cultural framework ... that idealizes and advocates a fusion of Christianity with American civic life."" Christian nationalism was big in the early 19th century. Legal scholar Steven K. Green noted in his 2015 book, Inventing a Christian America, that the Second Great Awakening, a Protestant evangelical revival movement that peaked in the 1830s, ""brought about ... a desire to see religious values reflected in the nation's culture and institutions."" Rev. Ezra Stiles Ely, a Presbyterian minister in Philadelphia, took things a step further when he told his congregation in 1828 that only leaders ""known to be avowedly Christians"" should be elected. In the words of religious studies scholar Richard Hughes, many participants in the Second Great Awakening ""sought to transform the nation into a Christian Republic."" In its aftermath, Griswold's account of Washington prayerfully adding ""so help me God"" to the presidential oath became part of America's Christian creation myth. Another age, another 'so help me God' story Like many cultural ideas, Christian nationalism has waxed and waned through American history. It was popular again in the years just after World War II, a time of increased tensions between the United States and the ""godless communists"" of the Soviet Union. Religion was an important weapon in the Cold War. As Sen. Joseph McCarthy said, ""The fate of the world rests with the clash between the atheism of Moscow and the Christian spirit throughout other parts of the world."" In this Cold War context, the United States added ""under God"" to the Pledge of Allegiance, made ""In God We Trust"" the country's national motto and created a new version of the Griswold story: that every president, not just Washington, had ended their oath of office with ""so help me God."" Actually, there is no compelling evidence that any president added ""so help me God"" before September 1881, when Chester A. Arthur was sworn in after the death of James Garfield. But it was important in Cold War America to prove that it was a Christian nation, so a new story was added to the American creation myth: Through the nation's history, all presidents invoked God as part of their oath. A search of the databases shows that this story began in 1948. One of the earliest examples was from Frank Waldrop, editor of the Washington Times-Herald, responding to the Supreme Court's decision in McCollum v. Board of Education that it was unconstitutional for public schools to promote religion. ""Every President from Washington down to Harry Truman has always taken that oath with his hand on the Bible,"" Waldrop wrote, ""and every President ... has added the undeniably religious phrase, 'So help me, God.'"" Waldrop used the assertion that presidents have all said ""so help me God"" as an argument for inserting religion into public schools. This is an important point about Christian nationalism: As scholar Eric McDaniel and others have shown, it is not just a view of the past; it is a call for action, specifically to reclaim America as a ""holy land."" Christian nationalism relies on a flawed understanding of the American past, but it has become an increasingly important part of our history. David B.

After expressing condolences to loved ones of the 14 victims killed in the New Orleans attack, Schiff added that Patel lacked the experience needed for the role to lead the bureau at the center of the investigation into that case. Patel instead is “someone whose top priority is political vendettas, who believes in ‘deep state’ conspiracy thinking”, said Schiff, who previously served on a US House committee that investigated the Capitol attack. Patel, a Trump loyalist, has promoted false conspiracy theories that the 2020 election was stolen from the president-elect who defeated Kamala Harris in November’s election. Patel has also claimed federal bureaucrats working in the “deep state” actually tried to overthrow Trump. In a previous interview with former Trump White House strategist Steve Bannon, Patel said he would target judges, lawyers, and journalists for investigating Trump and claiming they had a role in robbing Trump of victory in 2020. “We will go out and find the conspirators, not just in government but in the media,” Patel said in the interview. “Yes, we’re going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections.” Patel also claimed the FBI was involved in Trump’s 2020 election loss, in a November 2022 podcast episode that he hosted that was titled: “What did the FBI know before Jan. 6?” He started a foundation to defend Capitol attackers and helped produce a song to raise “funds and awareness for the due process that has been hijacked for so many people who were in and around” the Capitol attack. Patel has also written children’s books propagating conspiracy theories that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump. John Thune, the Republican US Senate majority leader, told Meet the Press on Friday that he spoke with Patel and said he believed he would prioritize the mission of the FBI and rebuilding trust in the institution. He did not say whether he plans to vote to confirm him, though. “The FBI is an agency that I think is in need of reform and needs a good makeover, so to speak,” Thune said. “I think that confidence and trust [in the FBI] is largely eroded, and there’s an opportunity to fix that. “I sat down and met with [Patel]. I think he understands that’s the mission, and if he’s successful through the nomination process, I hope that he will take very seriously that responsibility and focus on what he can do to make the FBI operate in a way that is protecting the American people and also being accountable.” The FBI has determined that the New Orleans attacker was a former US army veteran who had recently pledged his allegiance on social media to the Islamic State (US) terror group. He had traveled to New Orleans in October and November, using Meta smart glasses to record video of and scout out the site of the attack: Bourbon Street, where he ultimately drove a truck into a crowd before being shot dead. The attacker also built and planted homemade bombs on Bourbon Street in advance of the truck attack but did not have the proper device to detonate them, federal agents have said.",73,[],2025-01-06 14:51:23,2025-01-06 20:27:27

Across the country, […]",Matthew Ferguson,2025-01-06T14:00:33.000Z,"The South Carolina Department of Education headquarters in Lexington County (Provided by SC Department of Education) As an educator, I remember the late nights all too well — the hours spent piecing together resources, searching online and crafting material. Like so many educators, I wanted my lessons to engage every student and meet the expectations of rigorous state standards. It’s a Herculean effort. This isn’t just my story. Across the country, countless teachers are doing the same, pouring their hearts into creating lessons from scratch. Unfortunately, research from TNTP (formerly The New Teacher Project) shows that these well-intentioned, teacher-created resources align with grade-level standards only about 20% of the time, according to a 2018 report. This is not because teachers aren’t working hard enough. It’s because we’re asking them to do too much with too little. This status quo leaves students without consistent access to the quality instruction they deserve, and it’s exhausting for teachers. But it doesn’t have to be this way. If we want to honor teachers’ time and position them to thrive in their classrooms, we must provide only the best instructional resources — tools that free them to teach, not force them to work long hours after school to fill gaps on their own. Imagine asking a carpenter to build a house with a dull saw or bent nails. Even the most skilled craftsman would struggle to deliver quality work. Teachers face a similar challenge when they’re handed outdated, incomplete, or unengaging materials and asked to “just make it work.” By equipping teachers with quality, well-designed resources, we give them the tools to deliver meaningful instruction that meets the needs of all their students. These tools provide a reliable toolbox from which to work. These materials don’t stifle a teacher’s creativity. They enhance it. But tools alone aren’t enough. Teachers also need meaningful professional support to help them succeed in the classroom. In South Carolina, nearly 20,000 teachers have begun specialized training programs designed to deepen their understanding of how children learn to read, particularly in foundational skills like phonics. These programs emphasize evidence-based strategies that equip teachers to teach essential skills such as decoding words, building fluency, and fostering comprehension. With this practical knowledge, teachers are better prepared to give every child the strong reading foundation they need to succeed. When paired with high-quality classroom materials, this kind of professional learning has the power to truly transform instruction and help students thrive. When we provide teachers with quality tools and meaningful professional support, we amplify their impact in the classroom. These efforts don’t just lighten their workload, they help retain passionate educators and improve outcomes for students. Here in South Carolina, we’re making real progress. Thanks to strong support from the General Assembly and the State Board of Education, the South Carolina Department of Education has adopted new instructional materials for English language arts, which are already being implemented in schools statewide. We’re also in the process of reviewing math materials with the same level of care to ensure they meet state standards and provide teachers with the resources they need for student success. These efforts are paying off. I recently spoke with a South Carolina teacher who shared how having access to new instructional materials freed her from hours of preparation. “Now, I can focus on engaging my students instead of worrying about creating lessons from scratch,” she told me. This is exactly the kind of impact we’re working to achieve. When teachers have access to high-quality materials, they can spark curiosity, foster critical thinking, and promote the kind of lasting learning that sets students up for success — not just in school, but in life. Let’s renew our commitment to supporting South Carolina’s teachers and students. By giving teachers the tools and training they need, we can ensure every child has access to an excellent education and the opportunity to reach their full potential.",0,[],2025-01-06 14:52:22,2025-01-06 20:28:27

Many interpret the list as a who’s who of the corporations that are not paying workers enough, since Medicaid eligibility is largely dependent on income. The 2025 report, released this month, shows relatively few changes to the top 20 list of employers with the most number of employees enrolled in Nevada Medicaid. But it notes that the number of Amazon employees enrolled in Medicaid is rapidly growing compared to other top employers. Nearly 9,000 Amazon employees were enrolled in Nevada Medicaid last year, according to the report, compared to approximately 7,500 Amazon employees the prior fiscal year. For comparison, Walmart last year employed approximately 4,500 Medicaid enrollees and approximately 4,700 the year prior. Four years ago, the two retail companies both had roughly 3,500 Medicaid-enrolled employees. Since then, Amazon has opened several new facilities in Nevada. The company benefits from tax abatements provided by the state. In 2016, the Nevada Governor’s Office of Economic Development approved $1.8 billion in abatements, some of which was over a 10-year period, meaning they are still receiving them. Critics of Amazon and Walmart argue the costs associated with Medicaid coverage should be considered a public subsidy. Medicaid covered approximately 183,000 employees of large companies across Nevada, as well as 197,000 of their dependents. Those 380,000 people are slightly less than half of all Nevadans who were enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP in 2024. The cost of care for those 380,000 people was more than $1.1 billion in state fiscal year 2024. The cost of Medicaid coverage is split between the federal and state governments. For FY2024, Nevada paid 21%, or $240 million. Amazon employees and their dependents alone cost $51 million, $11 million of which was paid by the state. The total number of Medicaid-eligible employees and dependents listed in the DHHS report is believed to be artificially inflated because they include an unknown number of people who were covered by Medicaid through covid-era continuous enrollment policies. The “unwinding” of those federally set policies was completed during the fiscal year covered by the 2025 report and won’t be fully reflected until 2026. The report notes that, of the 183,534 Medicaid recipients working for large employers, 82,709 made median wage. The state believes many of these workers became eligible for Medicaid during the covid public health emergency and have been disenrolled. According to Nevada Medicaid, 787,705 people were enrolled in the program as of October 2024. In any given month in 2023, more than one in four Nevadans was eligible for Medicaid. The state has estimated only 36% of them used their health care monthly. Other takeaways from the top Medicaid employers report: Clark County School District, Wynn Las Vegas, and the State of Nevada rounded out the top 5 employers of Medicaid recipients. All three have been staples of the top 10 for several years. Bowtie Hospitality, the sole operator of the Fontainebleau Las Vegas, made its debut on the list in the first year of the property’s operations. Bowtie is the eighth largest employer of Medicaid recipients, with 1,476 employees covered. The Fontainebleau opened in late December 2023 after more than two decades of development and delays. The other businesses in the top 10 were: Sitel Operating Corporation, Smiths Food & Drug, Universal Protection Service, and Aria Resort. Southern Nevada is overrepresented in the report. Clark County made up 80% of the employees and dependents captured in the report but make up 73% of the general population. Two separate analyses by DHHS looked at recurring State of Nevada employees on Medicaid and found they skewed heavily female. Of the 889 state employees who were on Medicaid in fiscal years 2023 and 2024, 80% were female. Of the 1,733 state employees enrolled in Medicaid last year, more than half worked in DHHS, which includes the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services and the Aging and Disability Services Division.",0,[],2025-01-06 14:52:51,2025-01-06 20:28:46

Here’s what you should know to keep yourself and others safe on the road during snowstorms, heavy rain or other less-than-ideal driving conditions. The levels of driving advisories are stated in the Delaware Code and may be put into effect by the governor during a state of emergency. The restrictions can be in place for either the entire state or parts of Delaware based on current road conditions. A Level 1 Driving Warning advises driver to exercise extra caution on roadways if they must drive, but to avoid doing so unless there is a “significant safety, health, or business reason to do so,” according to the Delaware Department of Transportation. Stay informed: How many inches of snow today?

Citing both presidential immunity and the demands of Trump's impending Jan. 20 inauguration, his lawyers on Monday morning said Justice Juan Merchan's intention not to penalize Trump was ""of no moment."" ""Presidential immunity violations cannot be ignored in favor of a rushed pre-inauguration sentencing,"" the lawyers wrote in a court filing. In a written ruling later on Monday, Merchan said Trump's motion was mostly ""a repetition of the arguments he has raised numerous times in the past."" The judge declined to push back Trump's Jan. 10 sentencing, a date he had set just last week. In scheduling Trump's sentencing for Friday, the judge noted last week that he was not inclined to send Trump to jail. He wrote that a sentence of unconditional discharge, effectively putting a judgment of guilt on his record without a fine or probation, would be the most practical approach given Trump's looming inauguration. The judge said Trump, 78, may appear at his sentencing either in person or virtually. In their Monday filing, Trump lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove asked Merchan to hold off sentencing Trump while the appeals play out. Any delay would make it unlikely that Trump would be sentenced before his Jan. 20 inauguration. A Republican, Trump has long argued that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, brought the case to harm his reelection campaign. Bragg has said that his office routinely brings felony falsification of business records charges - the charge Trump faced in the case. Prosecutors with Bragg's office had urged Merchan to deny Trump's bid to delay the sentencing. ""The balance of equities weighs heavily in the People's favor given the strong public interest in prompt prosecution and the finality of criminal proceedings,"" the prosecutors wrote on Monday afternoon. The case stemmed from a $130,000 payment Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen made to adult film actor Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet about a sexual encounter she said she had with Trump, who denies it. After a six-week trial in state criminal court in Manhattan, a jury in May found Trump guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying records to mask the payment prior to the 2016 election. The hush money case made Trump the first U.S. president - sitting or former - to be charged with and convicted of a crime. Since the verdict, his lawyers have made two unsuccessful attempts to have the case tossed. Merchan previously rejected their argument that the U.S. Supreme Court's July finding in a separate criminal case against Trump that presidents cannot be prosecuted for official acts meant the hush money case must be dismissed. Merchan ruled that the hush money case concerned Trump's personal conduct. After Trump won reelection, his lawyers argued that having the case hang over him while president would impede his ability to govern. Merchan denied that bid, writing that overturning the jury's verdict would be an affront to the rule of law.

At a press conference, McElroy said he prayed the incoming administration would work to make America a better place.",NICOLE WINFIELD,2025-01-06T19:50:47.000Z,"ROME (AP) — Pope Francis on Monday named Cardinal Robert McElroy of San Diego as the archbishop of Washington, tapping one of his most progressively like-minded allies to head the Catholic Church in the U.S. capital at the start of Donald Trump's second administration. At a press conference, McElroy said he prayed the incoming administration would work to make America a better place. But he also identified Trump's threats of mass deportations of immigrants as a point of potential conflict, saying such policies were “incompatible with Catholic doctrine.” McElroy, 70, replaces the retiring Cardinal Wilton Gregory, who steps down after having navigated the archdiocese through the fallout of the 2018 eruption of the clergy sexual abuse crisis. The Vatican announced McElroy's new job on Monday, the Catholic feast of the Epiphany, in a bulletin that flagged another important appointment in Francis' reform agenda. The pope named Italian Sister Simona Brambilla the first-ever woman to head a Vatican dicastery, in this case the one responsible for religious orders. Francis, who was elected pope on a mandate of reform, has long had his eye on McElroy, making him bishop of San Diego in 2015 and then elevating him as a cardinal in 2022. McElroy has been one of a minority of U.S. bishops to harshly criticize the campaign to exclude Catholic politicians who support abortion rights from Communion, a campaign Francis has publicly criticized by insisting that bishops must be pastors, not politicians. He has also questioned why the U.S. bishops’ conference, which has leaned conservative in its leadership, consistently insists on identifying abortion as its “preeminent” priority. McElroy has questioned why greater prominence is not given to issues such as racism, poverty, immigration and climate change. He has also expressed support for LGBTQ+ youth and denounced the bullying often directed at them, further aligning himself with Francis’ priorities as pope. “McElroy is competent, kind, empathetic, and willing to fight on the side of the vulnerable,” said Natalia Imperatori-Lee, chairperson of the religion and philosophy department at Manhattan University. She said his nomination was particularly timely given the polarization in the U.S. “McElroy has experience leading a diocese marked by diversity and challenges, and I can’t think of a bigger challenge than to be so close to the seat of the U.S. government in 2025,” she said in an email. McElroy, a graduate of Harvard University with a master's in history from Stanford University, is a native of San Francisco and had ministered there until Francis moved him to San Diego. Vincent Miller, professor of theology at the University of Dayton, pointed to McElroy's writings on Christian nationalism and patriotism — in which he argued for a “morally sound and unitive"" patriotism as opposed to an isolationist one — as particularly relevant today. “McElroy is uniquely prepared for this moment,” Miller said in a social media post. “At a moment when constitutional democracy is in crisis in the US, on the anniversary of an insurrection that sought to undermine it, Francis has moved one of his most capable and uniquely qualified bishops into position to respond to the needs of this moment.” McElroy’s appointment to Washington comes just a few weeks after Trump, who takes office Jan. 20, nominated Brian Burch as U.S. ambassador to the Holy See. Burch, president and co-founder of the advocacy group CatholicVote, has criticized Francis and some of his policies, including his emphasis on “synodality” or making the church a more inclusive place. McElroy, who was a papal nominee to the Vatican's big synod process, made clear Monday that he was fully on board with Francis' vision of a church that doesn't discriminate. Speaking in Spanish to address Washington's sizeable Latino community, McElroy cited Francis' famous line “todos, todos, todos,” to emphasize that everyone is welcome in the church, no one excluded. He did, though, acknowledge likely points of disagreement with the incoming Trump administration. Climate change, he said, was “one of the greatest challenges” facing the world, while immigration would likely be a source of conflict if the administration fulfills its threat of mass deportations of migrants. “The Catholic Church teaches that a country has the right to control the borders, and our nation’s desire to do that is a legitimate effort,"" he said. ""At the same time, we are called always to have the sense of the dignity of every human person, and thus plans which have been talked about on some level of having a wider indiscriminate, massive deportation across the country would be something that would be incompatible with Catholic doctrine.” The Archdiocese of Washington includes the District of Columbia and the Maryland counties of Montgomery, Prince George’s, St. Mary’s, Calvert and Charles. It has a total population of 3,050,847, of whom 671,187 are Catholic. Its outgoing archbishop, Gregory, took over in 2019 at a time of turmoil for one of the nation's most important archdioceses. Its two previous leaders, ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick and Cardinal Donald Wuerl, were caught up in a new wave of the long-running clerical sexual abuse scandal. Wuerl stepped down after he lost the trust of his priests, and McCarrick was defrocked after a Vatican investigation found he abused adults as well as minors. Francis not only tapped Gregory to lead but then made him a prince of the church in 2020, making him the first Black American cardinal in the process. McElroy was indirectly tainted by the McCarrick scandal after revelations that a whistleblower had told him in 2016 that McCarrick slept with seminarians. McElroy acknowledged having received the report but said the whistleblower refused to provide him with corroborating evidence. Bishop Joseph Strickland, an arch-conservative whom Francis ousted as bishop of Tyler, Texas last year, cited the McCarrick connection in strongly criticizing Monday's appointment. ""The blatant corruption of Pope Francis and the US Cardinals is on full display with the appointment of a McCarrick clone to the same archdiocese where his evil reigned twenty years ago,"" Strickland tweeted. The Archdiocese of Washington is home to The Catholic University of America, which is run by the church and is viewed as more conservative than many other Catholic universities in the U.S. run by the Jesuits. The dean of CUA’s school of theology and religious studies, Professor Joseph Capizzi, said he looked forward to working with McElroy. “I hope he becomes engaged,” Capizzi said. “I hope we can influence him and he can influence us.” ___ David Crary contributed from New York. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

The New England Patriots' Week 18 quarterback showed off his game and his skills against the Buffalo Bills, and cost his team this year's No. 1 draft pick as a result. The Tennessee Titans swooped in — in a manner of speaking — and claimed the prize for itself. Fortunately for New England, losing the top pick in the 2025 draft isn't as devastating as it might be for other teams; the Patriots are set at quarterback for the foreseeable future with Drake Maye. Still, it would've been nice for New England to have that draft capital to deal away. That's not Milton's problem and not his responsibility. The rookie out of Tennessee scored twice early on the Bills, once on a 1-yard scramble and once on a magnificent 48-yard pass to Kayshon Boutte. Combined, the touchdowns put New England up 14-7 on the AFC's second seed. The Pats (4-13) would go on to win 23-16. New England came into the week tied with three other futile franchises — Cleveland, Tennessee and the New York Giants — at 3-13 on the season. That meant Week 18 would be the world's ugliest horse race, with Shedeur Sanders, Travis Hunter, Cam Ward or some other high-value draft pick prize awaiting the loser. Cleveland leaped out to an early ""lead"" by losing to Baltimore 35-10 on Saturday. That left the other three teams playing to keep pace or keep face, whichever you prefer. The NFL's schedule-makers wisely scheduled all three remaining bottom feeders at the same time, meaning the race for the No. 1 pick was one of the defining storylines of the early window of NFL games. The Titans and Giants checked out early, going down multiple possessions to the Texans and Eagles, respectively. New York managed to close to within a touchdown at 20-13, and Tennessee couldn't keep it that close. The Titans ""won"" the 3-14 battle by virtue of strength of schedule, and will have the first selection in the 2025 NFL Draft in April. Cleveland will pick second, New York third. New England finishes the season 4-13, and will pick fourth. Head coach Jerod Mayo won't get to see who that selection will be as the Patriots announced his firing shortly after Sunday's season finale. Yahoo Sports projected Cam Ward to go to the Giants in the top overall spot in our most recent pre-Week 18 mock draft; those results are obviously subject to change. It's worth pointing out that ""tanking"" might be in the best interests of the fans or the franchise, but it damn sure isn't anything players and coaches want on their résumés. There are contracts and future job opportunities at stake. So you can't blame the teams for playing hard when ""there's nothing to play for""; they're doing exactly what they're supposed to do. Perhaps a bit too late in the season to matter, but still.",264,[],2025-01-06 15:04:17,2025-01-09 00:32:14

History won't remember that, only that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers got the job done. It was far from the sure thing it was supposed to be. The Buccaneers got a tough test from a New Orleans Saints team that had been decimated by injuries and was given little chance to compete with the Buccaneers, who would win the NFC South with a win or an Atlanta Falcons loss vs. the Carolina Panthers on Sunday. Just remember before Week 18 next season that it's often a fallacy to believe a team will lay down because it has ""nothing to play for."" The Saints had a spirited effort and led into the fourth quarter. Eventually the Buccaneers got it right. Baker Mayfield threw a touchdown to Jalen McMillan in the fourth quarter to give the Bucs their first lead of the game. The Buccaneers scored an insurance touchdown in the final two minutes, but the Saints drove downfield with a chance to tie it. Tampa Bay got the stop it needed and took the division title with an ugly 27-19 win. They even got Mike Evans his 1,000-yard season on the final play of the game, keeping his streak alive. He has had 1,000 yards in 11 straight seasons, tying Jerry Rice's NFL record. That meant the Falcons' game against the Panthers, which was surprisingly going into overtime, meant nothing by the time the extra period started. The Falcons were eliminated when the Buccaneers won. It's probably better off for the Falcons anyway, because they lost 44-38 in overtime as Bryce Young had three passing touchdowns and two rushing TDs. That loss would have been horribly embarrassing had the Buccaneers also lost. Now, it'll be mostly a footnote. The NFC South race seemed to be over long before Sunday when the Falcons lost in overtime at Washington in Week 17. The Buccaneers were facing the sad-sack Saints, who had lost their previous two games by a combined 59-10 score. Once the Buccaneers won, they'd be on their way to the playoffs. But two weird things happened. The Saints never trailed in the first three quarters at Tampa Bay. Meanwhile, the Falcons were struggling with the Panthers. The Buccaneers and Falcons both trailed going into the fourth quarter of their games. It seemed for a while that both teams might lose, meaning the Buccaneers might back their way into the division title in the ugliest way possible. The Buccaneers finally got something going in the fourth quarter. Mayfield hit McMillan for 33 yards on a key fourth-and-8. McMillan got a 15-yard penalty after the play for what officials seemingly deemed a gun gesture by McMillan after the first down. The rookie made up for it with a touchdown catch to give the Bucs the lead. The Falcons were rallying at the same time. Right after McMillan scored in Tampa Bay, Drake London continued his huge day with a touchdown to pull the Falcons into a tie with the Panthers. It was a fun day for NFL RedZone. Eventually the Buccaneers did just enough to win. The Buccaneers trailed 16-6 at halftime and Mayfield was 0-41 in his career when trailing by at least 10 points. The Bucs were clearly in trouble. But they are moving onto the playoffs. It's a great accomplishment to come from behind and win the NFC South, after it looked like the Falcons would run away with it following a season sweep of the Buccaneers. And even though Tampa Bay wasn't great on Sunday, the Bucs won't be an easy out in the playoffs. They'll host the Washington Commanders next Sunday during wild-card weekend. Here are the winners and losers from Week 18 of the NFL season: Bo Nix: No, Nix isn’t going to win NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year. He might not finish in the top two. But he has had a tremendous season, especially for those who weren’t sure what the Denver Broncos were doing drafting him 12th overall. Nix finished his first regular season in style, throwing for 321 yards and four touchdowns in a 38-0 win over the Kansas City Chiefs that clinched Denver’s first playoff berth since 2015. Nix also led the Broncos with 47 yards rushing. Nix was the sixth quarterback taken off the board, and he looks like a long-term answer for Denver. We’ll get to see what he can do in his first postseason action next Sunday at Buffalo. Los Angeles Chargers: If you’re picking a playoff opponent, would it be the Ravens or Texans? Clearly the answer is Houston, and the Chargers agreed with that. The Chargers, playing for the No. 5 seed and the right to go to Houston for wild-card weekend after the Steelers’ loss on Saturday, got the job done against the Las Vegas Raiders on Sunday. The Chargers had a fairly painless 34-20 win, looking good as they have most of this season. Unlike some other teams on Sunday that didn’t seem too concerned with their seed or opponent, the Chargers played with a purpose to win. With the win the Chargers get a beatable Texans team on Saturday afternoon instead of having to try to knock off the Ravens, one of the few Super Bowl contenders in the AFC. It’s a good chance for head coach Jim Harbaugh to not just get the Chargers into the playoffs in his first season back in the NFL, but also win at least one postseason game. Geno Smith: You couldn’t say Smith had nothing to play for on Sunday. Smith was chasing some incentives in the season finale and one of them was a $2 million bonus for the Seattle Seahawks winning their 10th game. Presumably that crossed Smith’s mind when he threw a go-ahead touchdown to Noah Fant with less than four minutes to play, then watched as the Seahawks defense held on in the final seconds to close out a 30-25 win over the Los Angeles Rams. The Rams didn’t play starters and the game was closer than it should have been, but Seattle still got the win. Smith threw for 223 yards and four touchdowns. There will be some discussion about Smith and his future with the team this offseason. He goes into the winter and spring on a good performance, with a little more money (a total of $6 million in incentives) in his pocket too. Marcus Mariota: There was a big difference for the Washington Commanders in getting the sixth seed. That meant they'd avoid a date at Philadelphia on wild-card weekend. Washington needed a win to ensure getting the No. 6 seed and not falling down to No. 7. Despite that, the Commanders still pulled rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels to start the second half. Mariota got the job done off the bench. He broke a huge 33-yard run on a quarterback sneak on fourth-and-1 in the final minute, then hit Terry McLaurin for a game-winning touchdown with three seconds left to beat the Dallas Cowboys 23-19. The Commanders got the No. 6 seed in the NFC playoffs and will face the Buccaneers next Sunday. Mariota was great in a relief role. He was 15-of-18 for 181 yards and two touchdowns, and also ran for 56 yards. Daniels has had a historic rookie season, but the Commanders didn't even need him to beat the Cowboys on Sunday. Joe Milton III: Week 18 is for players like Milton. The New England Patriots weren't interested in putting their best foot forward in the finale, considering a loss would clinch the first pick of the 2025 NFL Draft. So Drake Maye played a series and was replaced by Milton, the raw rookie who had some splash plays in the preseason. And Milton played well. Well enough that New England didn't get that loss most Patriots fans probably wanted. He looked like what the Colts thought they were getting with Anthony Richardson, just with a sixth-round cost. The Patriots blew their shot to have the first pick of the draft by beating the Bills 23-16, who were mostly playing backups with the No. 2 seed already clinched. Milton led the way, completing 22-of-29 passes for 241 yards and a touchdown, with a rushing touchdown too. The Patriots fired heard coach Jerod Mayo after the game, but it was a pretty big day for Milton in his career journey. Jonathan Taylor: Taylor can rest in the offseason. The Indianapolis Colts put a high priority on winning Sunday, a week after a terrible loss to the New York Giants eliminated them from the playoff race. Perhaps that's because head coach Shane Steichen was worried about his future after the miserable loss. The Colts ran Taylor often, giving him 34 carries for 177 yards in an overtime 26-23 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars that might be the end of the Doug Pederson era. Taylor had another strong season. He'll be one of the building blocks for the Colts as they try to rebound from a disappointing season without a playoff berth. San Francisco 49ers: The 49ers’ season might be summed up by promising rookie running back Isaac Guerendo’s day Sunday. Given the chance to start the finale, Guerendo went down on his second carry and had to be carted off with knee and ankle injuries. All season the 49ers couldn’t outrun the injury bug. They didn’t have Brock Purdy in the finale, as Purdy rests after suffering an elbow injury last week, and although Joshua Dobbs played well the 49ers still lost 47-24 to the Arizona Cardinals. Nobody predicted the 49ers would be 6-11 this season. That wasn’t due entirely to injuries, but they played a big role in it. The 49ers will regroup in the offseason. There are few teams that needed the season to end and the offseason to arrive more than San Francisco. Miami Dolphins: The Dolphins might have gotten word that the Broncos weren’t going to get any challenge from the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday. Or perhaps they just anticipated the Broncos beating the Chiefs backups. Either way, the Dolphins were technically alive in the playoff race on Sunday — they needed a win coupled with a Broncos loss to get in as the final wild-card team — but didn’t play like it. If this was Aaron Rodgers’ last game he went out on a pretty good note, throwing for four touchdowns including the 500th of his career in a 32-20 Jets win that at least is a positive finish in a nightmare season. The Dolphins didn’t have Tua Tagovailoa, and they’ve been terrible in that situation this season unless they’re playing the Browns. The offense was punchless as usual without Tagovailoa, and they faded quietly into the offseason. And it sounds like Tyreek Hill wants out of town. Brian Callahan: Improvement is key for first-year head coaches. Improvement from the previous season, and improvement from the start of the season to the end. Callahan hasn't checked either box. The Tennessee Titans are worse than they were last season and they're probably worse than they were for the first month or so this season. The Titans finish Callahan's first season on a six-game losing streak, a skid that helped them nab the No. 1 pick in this NFL Draft. On Sunday they lost 23-14 to a Houston Texans team that was already locked into the No. 4 seed and started sitting starters in the first quarter. The Titans allowed backup running back Dameon Pierce to break a 92-yard touchdown run, a good way to sum up the effort and execution of the Titans late in the season. There hasn't been much speculation that Callahan won't be back for a second season. Maybe there should be. Christian Watson and maybe Jordan Love: The Green Bay Packers had to play their starters and try to win. The difference between the No. 6 seed and the No. 7, the latter of which would have to travel to Philadelphia on wild-card weekend, was massive. But it was costly. Watson went down with a bad-looking, non-contact knee injury. Shortly after, Love left after having his arm hit, and didn't return due to an elbow injury. The Packers didn't even get the win or the No. 6 seed. The Bears kicked a field goal as time expired, after the Packers took the lead with a FG in the final minute, for a 24-22 win that sends Chicago into the offseason on a good note. That field goal happened at the same time the Commanders scored with three seconds left to clinch themselves the No. 6 seed regardless of what happened in Green Bay. The Packers are in the playoffs, but they have to play at the Eagles and have some injury concerns going into it. It wasn't a positive day for them. New York Giants: The Giants couldn't beat Philadelphia Eagles third-string quarterback Tanner McKee, as the Eagles made 11 key players inactive with the No. 2 seed clinched. But the Giants won last week somehow to screw up getting the first pick of the NFL Draft. There is little positive to take from the Giants' miserable season. Malik Nabers' strong rookie season perhaps, but not much else. The Giants finished the season on a bad note, which is how most of their season went. They lost 20-13 to an Eagles team whose touchdown scorers were Ainias Smith and EJ Jenkins, who only hardcore preseason watchers would recognize. Now the Giants have decisions to make on general manager Joe Schoen and head coach Brian Daboll. If there was still a question about what to do with them, Sunday wasn't a good final impression.",383,[],2025-01-06 15:04:46,2025-01-09 00:32:25

Each CES comes with its fair share of big-name announcements, whether that’s from chipmakers, automotive companies, or small startups. And this year won’t be any different. Of course, the biggest stories will undoubtedly focus, as they have for the past two years, on artificial intelligence. There’s more to the show than just AI, though. Newer and better TVs, unique home appliances, and laptops as far as the eye can see — as well as a fair share of vaporware — are sure to flood the floors of the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC) throughout the weeklong tech extravaganza. Here’s what to expect from this year’s event. Chances are you’ve heard the terms AI agents or agentic AI over the past few months. If not, picture it as AI software that can complete multiple tasks for you. Think something like pulling information from your email and dropping it into a spreadsheet without you having to lift a finger. Agents have taken over the AI discussion in Silicon Valley and Wall Street, which means they’ll likely be all over CES 2025. In fact, agents had already made somewhat of an impact during last year’s CES. The Rabbit R1 AI gadget, which went viral at CES 2024, is designed to take actions on your behalf including navigating websites and user interfaces. And there’s little doubt we’ll see plenty of companies touting their own similar capabilities at this year’s show. If past CESes are any indication we’ll likely hear about AI agents for everything from TVs to washing machines. Tech loves a good trend, and with no end in sight for the AI hype, this is one that looks too good to pass up. It wouldn’t be CES without a few good chip stories. AMD (AMD), Intel (INTC), Nvidia (NVDA), and Qualcomm (QCOM) will all be in attendance, and each is expected to provide information about their own chip plans for the year ahead. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang will host the company’s keynote on Jan. 6, during which the firm is expected to debut its latest generation of consumer graphics cards. AMD is similarly set to hold its own conference at the event complete with its own graphics chips. Every chipmaker in the PC space is leaning heavily into the AI PC game to lure consumers and improve overall sales. And you can expect more of that at CES, as well. But whether AI PCs, computers designed to natively run AI applications, are enough to get consumers to pull out their credit cards is still an open question. We’ll learn more about the companies’ strategies and what makes their respective AI PCs better than their competitors’ in just a few short days. It’s hard to imagine CES without some wild new car tech, but years ago seeing a car roll into the LVCC would have been unheard of. Now there’s an entire wing dedicated to all things automotive and beyond. Automakers from BMW and Toyota (TM) to Honda (HMC) are set to show off their latest technologies, and companies from across the tech spectrum are all but certain to debut new ways of interacting with our four-wheeled fortresses. Much of that will include how tech will enable advanced driver assistance features in the coming years. And you can bet at least one company is going to mention full self-driving cars, even if it’s still years from becoming a reality, if ever. Cars aren’t the only modes of transportation that will pop up at CES. Everything from tractors and two-story tall dump trucks to private boats and flying taxis have graced the halls of the LVCC, and if I were a betting man, I’d say we’ll see more at CES 2025, as well. Big Tech is bracing for President-elect Donald Trump’s promised tariffs, and exactly how those will impact everything from enterprise to consumer electronics is certain to be top of mind. Trump has said that he will levy tariffs on goods from China; expressed his distaste for the CHIPS Act, which is meant to reshore chip manufacturing; and said the added costs to companies would force them to bring their businesses to the US. Still, there’s no guarantee that Trump will implement the tariffs as he’s said or when he’ll enact them. Regardless, the fact that the risk exists is enough to put Silicon Valley and investors on Wall Street on edge. It’s not just tariffs, though. Tech firms across the spectrum are bracing for Trump’s second time in the Oval Office, with leaders of several of the ""Magnificent Seven"" companies, including Meta’s (META) Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos cozying up to the president-elect in an attempt to repair their frayed relationships. It’s all sure to make for an interesting dynamic at CES, and an even more interesting year for tech overall. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com. Follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.

Social media users called out the actress on Sunday for “blatantly ignoring” the reality star in an awkward awards ceremony video. In the viral footage, the “Substance” star — who won her first Golden Globe for her role in the film — approached Elle Fanning at her table. Jenner, seated beside the sisters, interjected with a “congratulations” for Moore. The Emmy nominee, 62, thanked Jenner before turning back to Fanning. Jenner, 27, watched as the duo chatted for a moment before turning away — and did the same when Moore spoke to her boyfriend, Timothée Chalamet. The “Kardashians” star pulled out her phone as the A-lister retreated. “That was so messed up,” one X user wrote of the exchange, while another added, “Lmfao Demi gave her 5 fingaz to the face.” While a third wrote that Jenner “felt left behind,” many defended Moore’s behavior. “Idk I don’t think it’s that deep, I think she was just talking to the *actors* and she acknowledged kylie,” one pointed out to combat the “baseless narrative.” Reps for Jenner and Moore have yet to respond to Page Six’s requests for comment. Notably, the “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” alum channeled Moore in “Striptease” for a Halloween post — and Moore “liked” and twice re-posted the October 2024 upload. Sunday’s ceremony marked Jenner’s second time at the Golden Globes with Chalamet, 29, whom she began dating in 2023. On both occasions, the makeup mogul skipped the red carpet but sat with her partner inside the Beverly Hilton Hotel.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/sports/nfl-black-monday-live-updates-120346578.html,"NFL Black Monday live updates: Latest rumors, news, analysis on coach firings",,Sports,USA TODAY Sports,11 min read,"As ""Black Monday"" in the NFL spurs more coach firings from around the league, keep track of all the latest rumors and news with our live updates.","Chris Bumbaca and Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz, USA TODAY",2025-01-06T14:37:15.000Z,"NFL teams once again didn't wait until ""Black Monday"" to take drastic action with their coaching staffs this season. With Week 18 wrapping up Sunday and the playoff picture complete, four teams already find themselves with vacancies in their top jobs: the New York Jets, New Orleans Saints, Chicago Bears and New England Patriots. History suggests more firings are still to come, with dismissals of key assistant coaches also likely in several spots. And it shouldn't take long for teams to begin moving on their searches, with interview requests sure to start filtering in. Here are all the latest updates on coach firings and moves throughout the league on Monday: With the Jaguars (firing Doug Pederson) and Giants (keeping Brian Daboll), resolution came quickly for those teams Monday. But a pair of other organizations are still expected to make their intentions clear: the Dallas Cowboys and the Las Vegas Raiders. Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy worked this season on an expiring contract, though his deal runs through Jan. 14. Owner and general manager Jerry Jones has praised McCarthy in recent weeks and the coach said after Sunday's loss to the Washington Commanders – which dropped Dallas to 7-10 on the season – said he is interested in remaining with Dallas. For the Raiders, head coach Antonio Pierce earned the job based on the reviews he received from players after he took over as the interim head coach in 2023. But the Raiders finished 4-13 and will pick sixth in the NFL draft. The Tennessee Titans are expected to retain first-year coach Brian Callahan, and the Miami Dolphins and Indianapolis Colts clarified Sunday that Mike McDaniel and Shane Steichen, respectively, would return for 2025. That leaves five openings as of Monday morning – the three teams that fired their coaches during the season are looking for new ones, as are the New England Patriots (who let Jerod Mayo go after one year) and the Jaguars. Black Monday began in earnest with perhaps the most obvious move of the offseason: the Jacksonville Jaguars moving on from head coach Doug Pederson. Before the season, owner Shad Khan claimed this was the most talented team in Jacksonville since he purchased the organization. But the Jaguars finished 4-13 and third in a dismal AFC South, and Pederson's time was up despite a pair of 9-8 campaigns in his first two seasons (leaving him with an overall record of 22-29). Pederson led the team to a division title in 2022, his first season, and a dramatic comeback victory in the wild-card round over the Los Angeles Chargers before falling to the Kansas City Chiefs. The Jags started the next year 8-3 but missed the postseason and Pederson, who led the Philadelphia Eagles to their first-ever Super Bowl, never regained his winning ways. In a statement, Khan thanked Pederson and indicated general manager Trent Baalke will remain in that role. Only one New York team will be on the hunt for a new coach and GM this offseason. Giants owner John Mara, in a statement Monday morning, said head coach Brian Daboll and general manager Joe Schoen will return for the 2025 season. “As disappointing as the results of the season have been, (co-owner) Steve (Tisch) and I remain confident in the process that Joe and Brian have implemented and their vision for our team,"" Mara said in a statement. ""We look forward to the future and achieving the results we all desire.” The Giants went 3-14 in 2024, their 100th season that was supposed to be a celebratory campaign. Instead, the brain trust hired three offseasons ago faced questions down the stretch of whether the would lose their jobs. The ""Hard Knocks"" capturing the internal conversations between Schoen and Mara regarding former running back Saquon Barkley, who signed with the Philadelphia Eagles and had a historic season, served as fodder that the GM's job was in jeopardy. The product on the Giants' end kept declining. Quarterback Daniel Jones was benched and released midseason, and the team snapped a 10-game losing streak – the longest in franchise history – in Week 17. According to NorthJersey.com, part of the USA TODAY Network, the Giants had a team meeting at 8 a.m. ET followed by team brass debriefs. Daboll was Coach of the Year following the 2022 season, which included a surprise playoff appearance and postseason victory. But the Giants went 6-11 last season and after one of the worst years in franchise history, Daboll made his case that better quarterback play – which he'd mostly been deprived of since 2022 – actually gives teams a chance of winning. Now it appears he and Schoen will have the chance to choose a franchise quarterback of the future. The Dallas Cowboys' season ended the way it began: without Jerry Jones making a firm commitment to Mike McCarthy. Following Sunday's 23-19 loss to the Washington Commanders that wrapped up a 7-10 campaign for Dallas, the owner continued his long-running approach of speaking highly of his head coach while stopping short of saying anything definitive regarding McCarthy's job status for next season. ""Mike's one of the best coaches that I think there is,"" Jones said. ""He was made the coach here because I thought that, and he's done absolutely nothing to diminish my opinion of him as a coach."" McCarthy, who is under contract through Jan, 14, made it clear he wanted to remain with the organization despite speculation he could pursue another opening. “Absolutely. I have a lot invested here, and the Cowboys have a lot invested in me,” McCarthy said. “And then there’s a personal side to all these decisions. They all point the right direction. I think anytime you invest your time, energy, your belief, the connection you have, the relationships that are in place here, the understanding of what the organization can do and is willing to do. Those are all positive attributes that you take into account."" The Detroit Lions' win over the Minnesota Vikings shaped the NFC playoff picture, but it also could have fallout for several teams' coaching searches. With the Lions having a bye, offensive coordinator Ben Johnson and defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn can now conduct virtual interviews for head-coaching roles starting Wednesday. Had Detroit lost, they would have had to wait an additional week. Johnson is seen widely as one of the most in-demand coaching candidates after withdrawing from consideration during the last two hiring cycles. Glenn has kept the Lions defense rolling despite a bevy of injuries, and he has been linked to both the Jets and the Saints openings given his history with each franchise as a former player and assistant coach, respectively. On a day designed to be defined by on-field action, the Patriots turned heads with what they did after the completion of another trying year. Robert Kraft fired coach Jerod Mayo after only one season in what the Patriots owned called ""one of the hardest decisions I have ever made."" With Kraft making an abrupt pivot on the coach he appointed to be Bill Belichick's successor, USA TODAY Sports' Jarrett Bell sees the Patriots positioning themselves for one candidate in particular: Mike Vrabel. The former Tennessee Titans coach - and Patriots Hall of Famer after his storied playing career - is arguably the most enticing candidate on the market, and he already interview with the Jets last Friday. While the Patriots will still be required to adhere to the Rooney Rule in their interview process, expect Vrabel's presence to hang over the search. And read Bell's column on why the connection is so hard to shake. After the Las Vegas Raiders fell to the Los Angeles Chargers in their season finale, Antonio Pierce had no interest in ruminating on where he stood with the organization. ""No comment,"" Pierce said when asked about his job security. The Silver and Black continue to keep everyone in the dark regarding Pierce's future. There's been little insight as to the team's plans since owner Mark Davis said at the league meeting in early December that he was ""very disappointed"" with this season's results. Despite Las Vegas falling to 4-13, several players – including record-setting rookie tight end Brock Bowers – backed Pierce amid the ongoing uncertainty. Now it's up to Davis to make clear if he wants to bring back the coach he saw fit to make his full-time head coach after his successful interim stint or start from scratch. Doug Pederson might have had the hottest seat of any coach entering Week 18, but the leader of the Jacksonville Jaguars is still optimistic he'll be given a reprieve. ""I’ll find out this week,"" Pederson said after a 26-23 overtime loss to the Indianapolis Colts dropped the Jaguars to 4-13 on the season. ""It's hard to speculate right now. Emotions are running. I hope I’m still here, honestly. I feel like we have the makings of being a good football team. Our main guys need to get healthy, we need to continue to work hard. I’m optimistic and hopeful that happens."" Owner Shad Khan seemed to put the pressure on before the season by saying this season's iteration of the Jaguars was the best team to be assembled in franchise history. He gave Pederson a vote of confidence after a 1-4 start and did not make a move after Jacksonville suffered its greatest deficit ever in a defeat with a 52-6 loss to the Detroit Lions. Being eliminated by a 45-33 loss to the New York Giants in Week 17 ramped up speculation that the Indianapolis Colts could shake things up by dismissing coach Shane Steichen and/or general manager Chris Ballard. After the season was completed Sunday, owner Jim Irsay moved quickly to confirm the duo would be sticking around another year. “I’ve been evaluating our entire operation, and I believe in Chris Ballard and Shane Steichen and our collective ability to make the improvements needed to take us to the next level in 2025,” Irsay wrote in a statement posted to social media. “I know fans who want an immediate change in leadership will be disappointed. That means we all have a lot to prove, so we’ll get back to work and keep doing what we can to earn your support and make you proud to be a Colts fan.” The Colts have not been to the playoffs since the 2020 season and last won the AFC South title in the 2014 campaign. Since then, every other team in the division has claimed the crown at least twice. Despite acknowledging that the Dolphins ""fell short of our expectations this season,"" owner Stephen Ross said he will keep coach Mike McDaniel and general manager Chris Grier in place. ""Their positive working relationship is an asset to the Dolphins, and I believe in the value of stability,"" Ross said in a statement Sunday. ""However, continuity in leadership is not to be confused with acceptance that status quo is good enough. We will take a hard look at where we have fallen sort and make the necessary changes to deliver our ultimate goal of building and sustaining a winning team that competes for championships."" Miami finished 8-9 for the Dolphins' first losing season since 2019.

Last night was the Golden Globe Awards, where both TV and movies were honored as statues were given out to the lucky winners. As always, a number of viral moments happened, including Vin Diesel's awkward reunion with Dwayne Johnson. I didn’t guess Andrew Garfield putting on glasses would be the biggest Awards meme this week, but the internet was thirsty. Let's break it all down. Towards the end of this year's Globes, Andrew Garfield and Kerry Washington presented the Best Female Actor - Musical/Comedy Award, which Demi Moore took home in a historic win. While cinephiles were psyched that The Substance got it flowers, the internet exploded over the way the Spider-Man actor put on his glasses to read from the teleprompter. You can see the moment this move happened below, courtesy of the official Globes Twitter. Despite it getting late into the Golden Globes telecast, the internet blew up as a result of Garfield's glasses move. Thirsty tweets began showing up on X/Twitter, including some funny memes that were used to share how steamy they thought Garfield was in that moment. Check out one funny tweet below: Honestly, same. While wearing glasses isn't usually considered such a turn on, the way Andrew Garfield slipped them on and adjusted his necklace while presenting at the Golden Globes had people feeling some type of way. And smart money says the gif of him doing so is going to be circulating online for quite some time. While the 41 year-old actor is getting tons of love for his tenure as Spider-Man (which is streaming with a Disney+ subscription), this glasses move might have temporarily eclipsed those talks. Another tweet about this moment was very plain about its language, reading: that was the hottest thing i've ever seen (andrew garfield putting his glasses on) While this response was very clear in its language, other tweets about Garfield were way more thirsty. And I have to wonder if Garfield's fake twitter has helped him see any of these responses. Check it out: Well, that's one NSFW way of putting it. Since Garfield was seen on the red carpet taking his glasses on and off, it seems like he knew what he was doing with the movie that ultimately went viral at the Golden Globes. Another tweet admiring the actor reads: the glasses oh andrew garfield the man that you are #GoldenGlobes The internet is a funny thing, because it's often impossible to predict what is going to catch on and go viral. While the 2025 Golden Globe Awards had plenty of moments that caught fans' eyes, something about Andrew Garfield's glasses move caught the attention of fans online. Another funny tweet about this reads: Now we just have to wait and see if Garfield responds to all this chatter. He's proven himself to have a great sense of humor, like when he brought a life-sized Florence Pugh cut-out to the red carpet of It Ends With Us. So smart money says he'll love all the chatter about his seductive glasses move. Andrew Garfields is attached to a number of upcoming projects coming down the line, which means that he'll have plenty more opportunities to go viral.

Very few get a storybook ending. Here's the latest on coach hot seats entering Black Monday.,"Joe Rivera, USA TODAY",2025-01-06T01:39:09.000Z,"While some franchises are playoff-bound, others are bound to the hiring process. Unfortunately, the overwhelming majority of NFL coaches are hired to be fired. Very few coaches are afforded the luxury of finishing their coaching stints riding off into the sunset, hoisting the Lombardi trophy. That's already proven to be the case in 2024. Several head coaches have already been handed their walking papers: Robert Saleh, Dennis Allen and Matt Eberflus are all searching for employment as the rest of the league either prepares for the playoffs or get set for coaching searches of their own. It didn't take long for the first casualty of 2025 to hit the market. The Patriots have moved on from head coach Jerod Mayo, making Bill Belichick's successor a shocking one-and-done. With Black Monday right around the corner, here's the latest on who will stay and who will go: There are several coaches who may be coaching their final game for their respective teams on Sunday, including: Antonio Pierce, Raiders Doug Pederson, Jaguars Brian Daboll, Giants Mike McCarthy, Cowboys Jeff Ulbrich, Jets (interim) Thomas Brown, Bears (interim) Darren Rizzi, Saints (interim) Jerod Mayo was the first head coach to hit the unemployment line, and it didn't take long to get notice. Mayo was informed by owner Robert Kraft that the team was making a change in the hours after the Patriots' Week 18 win over the Bills. The Patriots released a statement from owner Robert Kraft on Mayo, saying, ""this was one of the hardest decisions [he has] ever made"": McCarthy's status with the Cowboys appears to be murky, but not necessarily due to a lack of confidence from Dallas' ownership. Jerry Jones has often given McCarthy a vote of confidence throughout the 2024 NFL season. The most recent example came during his weekly interview on 105.7 The Fan ahead of Week 18. ""Well, I feel good about Mike McCarthy,"" Jones said, per Cowboys.com. ""The main thing is, I like the job that he's done, it's unfortunate we've had the year that we've had, but I feel good about Mike."" That certainly doesn't sound like an owner who is eager to move on from McCarthy. That said, the bigger question appears to be less about whether the Jones' want McCarthy to return and more about whether the veteran coach would prefer to work elsewhere in 2025. – Jacob Camenker Pederson's fate seems all but sealed with the Jaguars entering Week 18. The Super Bowl-winning coach has had a forgettable season and stay in Jacksonville, headlined by Trevor Lawrence's inconsistencies at quarterback. With Lawrence out with injury and the Jaguars sputtering to a 4-13 record, Pederson is expected to be let go. Earlier in the week, Pederson made it seem like he knew he was on the doorstep looking for a new gig. ""[My family has] been around this league almost 30 years, player and coach, and you've seen a lot of things,"" Pederson said. ""If this is the last one, then I can look back and go, 'Hey, it was a great run. You had a chance to do a lot of great things. You had a chance to win a Super Bowl. You've coached some great players. You played in this league for a long time.' So, whatever happens, happens. But we keep moving forward."" – Joe Rivera A handful of coaches have already hit the unemployment line well before the calendar flipped to 2025.

In his sixth NFL season, McLaurin played on Washington teams that won three and four games, and until Washington won its ninth game against the Saints last month, he had never been on a team with more than eight wins. The Commanders didn't stop at nine wins, though. Washington won its last five games to finish 12-5, the franchise's best regular-season record since 1991. McLaurin was a major reason for the Commanders' success, going over 1,000 yards receiving for the fifth consecutive season and breaking the franchise record with 13 receiving touchdowns in a single season. Speaking of that record-breaking touchdown, McLaurin did it in the most dramatic way possible. Quarterback Marcus Mariota found McLaurin in the back of the end zone with three seconds remaining Sunday to defeat the Dallas Cowboys in the regular-season finale. Washington had already clinched a playoff bid and learned it would play in Tampa next weekend against the Buccaneers. After Sunday's game, McLaurin reflected on what it was like playing for a 12-win team. ""It's amazing, that's why you work so hard in the offseason,"" McLaurin said. ""Honestly, to win as many games as you can, to be sitting here right now, going into the playoffs with a chance to win it all. It's a new season. It's anybody's game. It's anybody's trophy. We believe if we put our best foot forward, we can be one of the teams competing for that."" Tweets by JPFinlayNBCS This team is built differently. McLaurin is correct; this team competes for 60 minutes, even if they aren't playing their best football. That type of mindset hasn't always been in Washington — at least for a long time — and it gives you a chance regardless of the opponent. If the Commanders get behind, they stay the course, rally behind the quarterback and, well, compete.

His resignation could come as early as Monday morning, when Trudeau is expected to hold a press conference at Rideau Cottage at 10:45 ET. It is unclear if Trudeau would leave immediately or if he plans to stay on as Canada's prime minister until a new Liberal leader is selected. According to The Globe, the Liberal Party national executive plans to meet next week, likely after the Wednesday's national caucus session, where they will make their leadership decision. The Liberals can either appoint an interim leader or hold a shortened leadership contest. Trudeau's possible resignation comes at a bad time for the Liberals, with polls showing that the party would lose to Pierre Poilievre's Conservatives. The next federal election must take place on or before Oct. 20, 2025. The prime minister has faced increased scrutiny ever since former finance minister Chrystia Freeland resigned in December, as she wrote a letter calling out Trudeau's ""political gimmicks"" in the face of Donald Trump's tariff threats. Calls for Trudeau to resign have grown among MPs of all parties, including the Liberals. For updates, analysis, reaction and press conferences, follow along with Yahoo News Canada's live blog. The prime minister will hold an announcement at 10:45 a.m. ET at Rideau Cottage on Monday morning.

The drama follows couple Pete (James Norton) and Maddie (Niamh Algar) Riley whose life is turned upside down when they learn their son Theo is actually the biological child of Miles (James McArdle) and Lucy Lambert (Jessie Brown Findlay), who have their son David. As they try to uncover how and why the swap took place, tensions mount between the couples and drastic actions begin to be taken. It's no wonder viewers heaped praise on the show on social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and BlueSky, calling it a ""fantastic"" watch. But there were some who were unhappy with parts of the plot, arguing that the events that take place were ""unrealistic"". The first episode for Playing Nice introduced viewers to the basic premise, with Pete and Maddie meeting Miles and Lucy for the first time, except their first meeting with their respective children is something they organise themselves. Pete and Maddie bring Theo to Miles and Lucy's home, where they meed David for the first time, and all of this happens without a mediator there — something that some viewers took issue with. One person wrote on X: ""Surely there would be some kind of professional mediation or social worker/lawyer present in a neutral zone.. not “oh pop round for a glass of champers while we have a little chat about everything” kind of situation!

Have the hospital authorities just shared addresses and told them to get on with it?"" Over on BlueSky, the complaints around the plot hole were much the same with one viewer writing: ""Not a social worker in sight"" While one person who watched the show took issue with the fact Pete and Maddie were happy to let Miles and Lucy take care of Theo soon after their first meeting, writing: ""Oh c’mon. As he’d happily let her babysit so soon onto her own. You really have to suspend belief with this story."" In response to the complaints around the show, one person said simply: ""#PlayingNice is a drama,it isn't meant to be completely realistic or believable. Saying that, found it a bit too quick (strangers to best mates to taking them to court in one episode) but I will persevere. From the same writer/lead actress as Malpractice, which was phenomenal.""

Miles is a complete weirdo but there’s gonna be a big twist at one point. Oh and James Norton is [hot]"". But it wasn't all bad, there were plenty of viewers who celebrated the series for how entertaining it is and even went so far as to watch all four episodes in one sitting. One viewer who did just that wrote: ""Binged all of @ITVX’s #PlayingNice and it is fantastic! So glad it ended the way it did because I’ve never felt such hatred for a certain character before!"" Another viewer wrote: ""Feel like I’m on death’s door but is anyone else hooked on #PlayingNice on @ITV @ITVX? Didn’t even mean to put it on but I can’t stop watching"" The show's first episode centres on Pete, Maddie, Miles and Lucy trying to build a relationship with each other, only for it to be revealed at the very end of the episode that Miles wants to take Pete and Maddie to court. He wants to gain custody of his biological son Theo whilst also keeping custody of David. This dramatic moment is the beginning of the troubles between the two couples, with Pete and Maddie scrabbling to find a way to keep custody of Theo whilst Mile manipulates everything they have ever said or done around him to his benefit. It is a dramatic turn of events, and one that matches what can be expected of thriller writer JP Delaney's work. It was this that made Norton want to work on the series, both as an actor and producer, as he told Yahoo UK ahead of the show's release: """"[It] is the kind of work Kitty [Kaletsky, his producing partner at Rabbit Track Pictures] and I really set out to make, character driven [stories with] really nuanced, rich, complicated, relatable, individuals, and then throwing these types of people into these mad circumstances and seeing how they would navigate it.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tiktok-offers-early-2025-test-for-supreme-court-140059106.html,TikTok offers early 2025 test for Supreme Court,,US,Yahoo Finance,6 min read,"The Supreme Court will hear several cases in 2025 with dramatic implications for corporate America, starting with the question of a looming US ban of the TikTok app.",Alexis Keenan    · Senior Legal Reporter,2025-01-06T08:25:37.000Z,"The Supreme Court is starting 2025 with a blockbuster case that will have dramatic implications for one of China’s most valuable technology companies, millions of American smartphone users, and some of the biggest social media companies in the US. TikTok is making an emergency appeal before the highest court, asking it to block enforcement of a federal law signed by President Joe Biden in April that effectively bans the app on Jan. 19, unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary. The company's arguments that the law should be overturned in the name of free speech will be aired at a hearing on Jan. 10, just 10 days before Donald Trump is sworn in as president. Trump, who on the campaign trail suggested in a social media post that he would ""save TikTok,"" is asking the court to suspend the divestment deadline and consider his preference for a “negotiated resolution"" — given that as president, he will be responsible for national security. Late on Friday, the Department of Justice asked the Supreme Court to reject Trump's request, saying no one was disputing that China ""seeks to undermine U.S. interests by amassing sensitive data about Americans and engaging in covert and malign influence operations."" A ruling from the Supreme Court to uphold the ban could be a long-term boon for TikTok's social media rivals by redistributing advertising dollars to platforms like Meta (META), according to Mark Lightner, head of special situations legal research for CreditSights, an independent credit research firm. Other US tech companies that supply microchips and cloud computing services to TikTok could see a dent in revenue. The court may have tipped its hand about how it may rule, Lightner said, when it decided to hold arguments on Jan. 10 rather than first grant TikTok’s request to pause the new law and then hear arguments later in the court’s 2025 term. One possible outcome in the coming weeks is that the court will find the law constitutional and let it stand, leaving Congress to deal with it if lawmakers and Trump want to reverse it. ""It’s possible there were not enough votes to grant a stay a couple weeks ago,"" Lightner said, noting that it takes five justices to implement a stay and just four to take up the dispute. The TikTok case will likely be the most prominent corporate case to be argued before the Supreme Court in 2025. But there are others the business world will surely be watching, with widespread implications for other key industries. One that could have major repercussions for the auto and fuel industries centers on longstanding opposition to how California sets vehicle emission standards, which are tougher than those imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). California can do this because of an exclusive waiver it was allowed to request from the EPA's Clean Air Act. The EPA allowed the waiver so the state could more aggressively address its smog issues. Valero Energy Corp's Diamond Alternative Energy and other plaintiffs said the EPA's grant of this waiver let the state act as a ""junior-varsity EPA"" and quasi-federal regulator on global climate change. The plaintiffs in Diamond Alternative Energy v. Environmental Protection Agency include petroleum and biomass-derived fuel refiners and producers, along with a fuel trade association and 17 states. Automakers Ford (F), Volkswagen (VWAGY), Honda (HMC), BMW (BMW.DE), and Volvo also intervened in the case. The case will be closely watched for its potential to impact the shift from fossil fuels to electric vehicles. The Court will address whether the petitioners have standing to bring their case, given that the D.C. Circuit Court ruled they were not directly injured by the waiver, and whether the waiver is unlawful. Another key question to be considered by the Supreme Court could impact how much companies must pay for labor. The case that surfaced this issue, EMD v. Carrera, started with work done by sales representatives at a company (EMD) that distributes food brands. These reps said they didn’t receive overtime pay despite working more hours than a normal week. They filed a lawsuit under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and found a lower court willing to rule in their favor. The court said EMD followed the wrong standard in classifying the representatives as exempt from minimum wage and overtime pay. Although Congress passed the FLSA, allowing employers to exempt certain workers from overtime pay, including those who work as outside sales reps, the lower court said that a company must show ""clear and convincing evidence"" that a worker is exempt. EMD has argued that such a bar is too high. Whether companies can file cases with courts that may be more inclined to favor their views is the subject of another case that will be argued this month before the Supreme Court. The case, Food and Drug Administration v. R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co., started with the tobacco maker R.J. Reynolds challenging an FDA ban on flavored e-cigarettes. It made the challenge in a New Orleans-based federal appeals court known as the Fifth Circuit, which covers Texas and nearby states and is known for its conservative opinions. A case against the FDA would normally be filed in Washington or in the area where R.J. is based, which would be the Fourth Circuit. But R.J. joined with sellers of vapes in Texas to file in the Fifth Circuit. The Fifth Circuit ruled in R.J.’s favor last year, prompting the FDA to ask for a Supreme Court review. The Biden administration's Justice Department argued the ruling from the Fifth Circuit ""facilitates blatant forum shopping"" and ""undermines the precedents of other courts."" Another Supreme Court case that will come before the high court in 2025 could expand or limit the Justice Department's reach to go after financial wrongdoing. The case, Stamatios Kousisis and Alpha Painting and Construction v. US, deals with a contractor who deceived the government in an application for a government contract. The government argues that federal wire fraud and mail fraud statutes should be interpreted broadly to permit prosecution, even when the government did not suffer financial harm. Daniel Ahn, a white-collar defense attorney and former federal prosecutor, said if the government's broader interpretation is accepted, it could lead to a larger swath of investigations into corporate conduct and to an increase in criminal and civil prosecutions. ""If the wire fraud statute is defined very broadly to encompass no financial loss schemes, then that really expands the universe of material that plaintiffs lawyers ... can bring against businesses,"" Ahn said.

Armed with a newfound resolve to take care of myself instead of only taking care of two small children and a husband, I made an appointment with my primary care doctor. Dr. J had served as my family doctor from when I was in grade school. He had cared for my parents, my grandparents, my aunts and uncles, my siblings. And so when he came into the office where I was sitting with greasy hair and bags under my eyes, I felt relief. Dr. J knew me. Dr. J would help me. I’m a lifelong fat person. I was over 10 pounds when my mother pushed me out of her body, two weeks late — accompanied by a “giant episiotomy,” she’d always tell other women with a knowing, exaggerated eye roll. I never grew out of being the fat girl. I went to Weight Watchers meetings at 12 and 22; I climbed up and down 60 or 70 pounds at a time on many occasions; I pressured myself to fit into that wedding dress so I wouldn’t “regret” my wedding photos. But here I was, in Dr. J’s office, and now my fatness was the least of my problems. “What’s going on, Sara?” he asked. “I’m in therapy,” I said. “My second kid is up every night, all night, for hours and hours. And it’s been two years of that.” “The second one comes in like a bat outta hell,” he said, nodding. “And I have no help,” I said. Dr. J nodded again. “Your mom…” he said, knowing of her dire diagnosis. “She’s dying,” I said. I could never not tell the truth. Others danced around her cancer diagnosis and acted like she was a warrior who was supposed to defeat the same enemy that even the most advanced scientists in the world couldn’t beat. But I saw my mom’s agony and suffering. She would have been there night and day to help me with the second kid, if she could have. “My therapist wants me on an SSRI. I haven’t slept in two years, I’m parenting two small kids in a global pandemic, and I am watching my mom needlessly suffer through treatment after treatment when we all know she’s terminal. I’ve been avoiding going on an antidepressant for a long time but I feel ready to accept it now.” “We can do that,” Dr. J said. “No problem.” “Thank you,” I breathed. I reached down to gather my coat and bag. I felt so much relief. “But we gotta get you on the scale,” Dr. J said. “What?” I asked. Sweat pricked along my hairline. “The nurse didn’t record your weight earlier,” he said. “I need to write it down. Can you step on the scale?” “Oh,” I said. “I told her I really didn’t need to be weighed today. I have enough troubling my head right now.” I laughed a little, good-girl syndrome even as I defied authority. But I was proud of my earlier resolve to say no to things that are bad for my mental health, which was the explicit reason for my visit. “No, you do,” Dr. J said. “Get on up there.” I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. “No,” I said. “I don’t want to.” “I don’t care,” he said. “Get up there. I need to write it down.” You ever think that we’re all still angry 15-year-olds and we never really grow out of that? Because that’s what was happening when I literally put my hands on my hips and said to him, “Yeah, who says?” “Me. I do.” he said. “What do you have for my last recorded weight?” I asked. He checked my folder: 275. “It’s not much different now,” I said. “I’ve always known I’m fat, doc. And so have you. But if you need my weight for dosing or something, I’m just about the same as I was before.” “Go,” he said, using the folder to create a herding gesture toward the tall medical scale. When I finally stepped on the scale, it balanced out just as I said it would. And when I stepped off the scale, I told myself I’d never set foot back in Dr. J’s office. In fact, I didn’t seek any sort of medical care for a long time after that visit. I wish I could say this was the worst I’ve ever been treated by a medical professional due to my fatness. I wish I could say that sitting with a trusted doctor who just listened to you say you don’t know how to get through the day without wanting to die, and then responds to your confession by going on a power trip about your weight was the worst experience I’ve ever had as a visibly fat person in a medical setting, but it’s not. It’s just the most ridiculous. I’m stable enough now to recount this, though, thanks to the antidepressant. A couple of years later, my mom had died, my child was finally sleeping, and the pandemic panic had subsided. I felt relief that these battles were resolved, regardless of the outcomes. After such an intense and long period of suffering, I so badly wanted to grasp for joy. During my second pregnancy, I bent down to pick up my toddler, slung him onto my hip, and heard something internally crack in my back. It didn’t feel good but I kept going with my daily activities, as moms so often do. And with pregnancy, parenting a toddler, and my mom’s illness, I didn’t have the wherewithal to get it checked out at the time. I also knew Dr. J would likely explain my pain away with my weight, as he’d done plenty of times in the past. But a couple of years later, that crack in my back had turned into a lump that ached all day every day. And now that my life had a little bit of room in it for me, I wanted to seek medical help to figure out the source of my back pain. I was fearful when I made the appointment with the spine specialist. Would she dismiss my pain when she saw how fat I was? Would she tell me to go home and lose weight first before she considered any sort of treatment for me? Would the pain go away if I actually did lose weight? Is the lump protruding from my lower spine enough to convince a doctor that I am worth medical attention beyond weight loss? I agonized over the appointment, and I even canceled and rescheduled a couple of times. I wondered if I could just live with the back pain, instead of going to a doctor and risking being turned away because of the number on the scale. Armed with facts about fatphobia and discrimination against fat people by medical providers, I sat on the examining table and waited for the spinal specialist to enter the room. I had rehearsed my spiel, was ready to advocate for myself, and I would not be dismissed. Battle mode. Chest puffed out. Nothing to lose. Dr. White walked in and greeted me as she sat down. “So you’re having lower back pain?” she asked. “Yes,” I said as I took a deep breath. “I’ve had lower back pain for a long time but something cracked down there a few years ago and it’s been worse since then. I know I’m a fat person and many doctors in the past have told me to lose weight before they would address my very separate medical issue, but this giant lump protruding from my lower back has absolutely nothing to do with my weight. It’s not normal to have a lump here and I’m not even 40. Fat people do not receive adequate medical care because they are usually fat-shamed instead of being seen as individual patients but I will not let that happen to me today. Please treat my lower back pain as if I were a thin person.” Dr. White was motionless in her chair and just blinked at me for a second. Did she think I was a crazy person? A combative feminist? A problem patient? Then she opened the folder in her hands and produced the image of the MRI of my spine from a few weeks ago. “Of course you’ve been experiencing pain,” Dr. White said. “You have three herniated discs in your lower spine and you also have scoliosis. Has anyone ever told you that?” I was instantly transported to my middle school nurse sending home a note to get my back checked out by my family doctor for suspected scoliosis. But good old Dr. J looked at my 12-year-old spine and told my mom that I’d grow out of it if I just lost weight; the end, buh-bye. My 37-year-old spine was still crooked, with an 11% curve, as I’d learn from Dr. White. “I’m so sorry you haven’t been taken seriously,” Dr. White said back in the spinal examining room. “But your weight has nothing to do with the fact that you have an actual medical issue.” My head felt floaty. I was smiling and it wasn’t even good-girl syndrome. I had been seen, truly seen. And I didn’t even have to advocate to be treated like a human and fight the stigma of fatness. Dr. White laid out a treatment plan for my spine. It’s ongoing. We try something and then assess its efficacy, and when I go into her office, I know I’ll be viewed as a legitimate patient. I know my concerns will be treated as valid. I know I’ll be heard. Dr. J’s dismissal of my mental health needs caused me to avoid the medical care I needed. For several years, I just ignored my pain because the shame of doctors’ focus on my weight was too much. But once I got stable from antidepressants and the events in my life evening out, I could see my mistreatment as my doctor’s fault, not mine. Now, whenever I meet a new doctor, I give myself a pep talk and equip myself with the speech I gave Dr. White. But I also know that if I have to do much more than give a few sentences of advocating for myself for them to see me beyond my fatness, I need to pick a new doctor.

French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau announced the latest arrest Sunday evening — the third in as many days. A French media report that the minister attached to his post on X said the influencer posted a video to his 138,000 followers on TikTok that French authorities deemed anti-Semitic. The arrest in Montpellier, southern France, and two others in the Alpine city of Grenoble and the western port city of Brest come amid renewed turbulence in the often complicated relationship between France and Algeria, which shook off French rule in 1962 after a brutal war. A shift last July in France's decades-old position on the disputed Western Sahara region of northern Africa angered Algeria and prompted the withdrawal of its ambassador in Paris. The French government, meanwhile, has denounced Algeria's detention since November of French-Algerian writer Boualem Sansal, who is an outspoken critic of the Algerian government. The French government hasn't linked the tensions with Algiers to the three arrests. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said Sunday that France wants “the best relations” with Algeria. But he said Paris has doubts about the Algerian government's commitment to deals agreed in 2022 that were seen as important steps toward mending their relationship. The first Algerian influencer arrested, a 25-year-old who reportedly had more than 400,000 followers on TikTok before his account was closed down, was detained Friday morning in Brest. He faces trial Feb. 24 in a Brest court on a charge of expressing support online for an act of terror, which is punishable by up to 7 years in prison, the Brittany port city's prosecutor said in a statement. The statement said that during police questioning, the man acknowledged that he was the author of Arabic-language videos on TikTok that called for acts of terror in France and overseas. He told police that the videos targeted opponents of Algeria's government, the statement said. The arrest of another Algerian, in Grenoble, was announced by the interior minister in a post on X on Friday night. The minister described the man as an influencer and said that “he too will have to answer to the courts for vile comments made on TikTok.” At a court hearing on Monday, the man asked for more time to prepare his defense, Grenoble prosecutor Eric Vaillant said. He faces a charge of inciting an act of terror online, also punishable by 7 years imprisonment, and will be kept in detention until he's tried on March 5, the prosecutor said. The prosecutor's office in Montpellier didn't immediately respond to emailed questions about the arrest in that city.",55,[],2025-01-06 15:11:14,2025-01-07 02:45:37

They are fighting an uphill battle according to legal experts though. The Blaugrana will play for an emergency precautionary measure to keep Olmo and Victor registered while they present their case as to why the registration period should be extended until the 2nd of February, including the same period of the January transfer window. Some say they may also argue a clause in the RFEF regulations that notes force majeure as an alternative reason for registering players outwith the stipulated periods. The RFEF have issued a favorable report to Barcelona, admitting that the regulations may not be in accordance with the case of Dani Olmo and Pau Víctor. A reform of the regulation is being studied, and will be approved in the coming months. Barça will use it in court. @FCBRAC1 — barcacentre (@barcacentre) January 6, 2025 The emergency precautionary measure, in contrast to a precautionary measure, generally only hears one side of the argument to process the matter urgently, but La Vanguardia (via Diario AS) say that the CSD will hear out the Liga and RFEF arguments on the motion, which could delay the resolution of the case though. Barcelona had hoped for a ruling on that matter within 24 hours. Meanwhile El Periodico have consulted two legal experts in sports law, and have stated that it is unlikely that the CSD will side with Barcelona. It would not only mean going against the regulations that they have agreed on with the RFEF, and starting another conflict with the Federation, after rocky relations in recent history. The face that they are not the last resort either, with Barcelona still able to appeal through the ordinary justice system, means they could ‘wash their hands’ of the situation. The one contradictory report on the matter comes from RAC1, who say that the RFEF have sent Barcelona a report that indicates that the regulations may not be cover the Olmo and Victor registration cases. They are supposedly studying a change to the rules in the coming months, and Barcelona will use this in court.",,[],2025-01-06 15:11:14,2025-01-07 02:45:37
https://www.yahoo.com/news/remarkable-life-andr-e-blouin-072344496.html,The remarkable life of Andrée Blouin - Africa's overlooked independence heroine,,World,BBC,9 min read,"Blouin ran in the same circles as liberation icons like Patrice Lumumba, Kwame Nkrumah and Sékou Touré.",Wedaeli Chibelushi - BBC News,2025-01-06T12:56:46.000Z,"""I know that you can die twice. First comes physical death... to be forgotten is a second death,"" notes screenwriter Eve Blouin, in an epilogue at the end of her mother's autobiography. Eve understands this sentiment more than most. In the 1950s and 60s, her mother, the late Andrée Blouin, threw herself into the fight for a free Africa, mobilising the Democratic Republic of Congo's women against colonialism and rising to become a key adviser to Patrice Lumumba, DR Congo's first prime minister and a revered independence hero. She traded ideas with famed revolutionaries like Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah, Guinea's Sékou Touré and Algeria's Ahmed Ben Bella, yet her story is hardly known. Going some way towards remedying this injustice, Blouin's journey featured in last year's Oscar-shortlisted documentary Soundtrack to a Coup d'Etat. What's more, Blouin's memoir, titled My Country, Africa: Autobiography of the Black Pasionaria, is being re-released, having spent decades out of print. In the book, Blouin explained that her yearning for decolonisation was sparked by a personal tragedy. She grew up between Central African Republic (CAR) and Congo-Brazzaville, which at the time were French colonies named Ubangi-Shari and the French Congo respectively. In the 1940s, her two-year-old son, René, was being treated in hospital for malaria in the CAR. René was mixed-race like his mother, and because he was one-quarter African, he was denied medication. Weeks later, René was dead. ""The death of my son politicised me as nothing else could,"" Blouin wrote in her memoir. She added that colonialism ""was no longer a matter of my own maligned fate but a system of evil whose tentacles reached into every phase of African life"". Blouin was born in 1921, to a 40-year-old white French father and a 14-year-old black mother from the CAR. The two met when Blouin's father passed through her mother's village to sell goods. ""Even today, the story of my father and my mother, while giving me much pain, astonishes me still,"" Blouin said. When she was just three, Blouin's father placed her in a convent for mixed-race girls, which was run by French nuns in the neighbouring Congo-Brazzaville. This was common practice in France and Belgium's African colonies - it is thought that thousands of children born to colonialists and African women were sent to orphanages and separated from the rest of society. Blouin wrote: ""The orphanage served as a kind of waste bin for the waste products of this black-and-white society: the children of mixed blood who fit nowhere."" Blouin's experience in the orphanage was extremely negative - she wrote that the children at the institution were whipped, underfed and verbally abused. But she was headstrong - she escaped from the orphanage aged 15 after the nuns attempted to force her into marriage. Blouin eventually married by her own will, twice. After René's death, she moved with her second husband to Guinea, a West African country which was also governed by the French. At the time, Guinea was in the midst of a ""political tempest"", she wrote. France had promised the country independence, but also required Guineans to vote in a referendum on whether or not the country should maintain economic, diplomatic and military ties with France. The Guinean branch of the pan-African movement the Rassemblement Démocratique Africain (RDA) wanted the country to vote ""No"", arguing that the country needed total liberation. In 1958, Blouin joined the campaign, driving throughout the country to speak at rallies. A year later, Guinea secured its independence by voting ""No"" and Sékou Touré, Guinea's RDA leader, became the nation's first president. By this point, Blouin had begun to develop considerable clout in post-colonial, pan-African circles. She wrote that after Guinea became independent, she used this influence to advise the CAR's new President Barthélemy Boganda, persuading him stand down in a diplomatic row with Congo-Brazzaville's post-independence leader, Fulbert Youlou. But counselling was not all Blouin had to offer this fast-changing Africa. In a restaurant in Guinea's capital, Conakry, she met a group of liberation activists from what would later become DR Congo. They urged her to help them mobilise Congolese women in the fight against Belgian colonial rule. Blouin was pulled in two directions. On one hand, she had three young children - including Eve - to raise. On the other, ""she had the restlessness of an idealist with a certain anger at the world as it was"", Eve, now 67, told the BBC. In 1960, with Nkrumah's encouragement, Andrée Blouin flew alone to DR Congo. She joined prominent male liberation activists, such as Pierre Mulele and Antoine Gizenga, on the road, campaigning across the country's 2.4 million sq km (906,000 sq miles) expanse. She cut a striking figure, travelling through the bush with her coiffed hair, form-fitting dresses and chic, translucent shades. In Kahemba, near the border with Angola, Blouin and her team paused their campaign to help build a base for Angolan independence fighters who had fled from the Portuguese colonial authorities. She addressed crowds of women, encouraging them to push for gender equality as well as Congo's independence. She also had a knack for organising and strategy. Soon, the colonial powers and international press caught wind of Blouin's work. They accused her of being, among many things, Nkrumah's mistress, Sékou Touré's agent and ""the courtesan of all the African chiefs of state"". She attracted even more attention when she met Lumumba. In her book, Blouin describes him as a ""lithe and elegant"" man whose ""name was written in letters of gold in the Congo skies"". When the country clinched its independence in 1960, Lumumba became its first prime minister. He was just 34 years old. Lumumba selected Blouin as his ""chief of protocol"" and speechwriter. The pair worked together so closely that the press dubbed them ""Lumum-Blouin"". Blouin was described by the US's Time magazine as a ""handsome 41-year-old"" whose ""steel will and quick energy make her an invaluable political aide"". But a slew of disasters struck team Lumum-Blouin - and the newly formed government - just a few days into their tenure. Firstly, the army revolted against their white Belgium commanders, sparking violence across the nation. Then, Belgium, the UK and US backed secession in Katanga, a mineral-rich region that all three Western nations had interests in. Belgian paratroopers swooped back into the country, supposedly to restore security. Blouin described the events as a ""war of nerves"", with traitors ""organising everywhere"". She wrote that Lumumba was a ""true hero of modern times"", but also admitted she thought he was naïve and, at times, too soft. ""It is true that those who are of the best faith are often the most cruelly deceived,"" she said. Within seven months of Lumumba taking charge, army chief of staff Joseph Mobutu seized power. On the 17 January Lumumba was assassinated by firing squad, with the tacit backing of Belgium. It is possible the UK was complicit, while the US had organised previous plots to kill Lumumba - fearing that he was sympathetic to the Soviet Union during the Cold War. In her book, Blouin said the shock and grief caused by Lumumba's death left her speechless. ""Never before had I been left without torrents of things to say,"" she wrote. She was living in Paris at the time of the killing, having being forced into exile after Mobutu's coup. To ensure Blouin would not talk to the international press, the authorities made her family - who had moved to Congo - stay in the country as ""hostages"". The separation was crushing for Blouin, who, as Eve describes, was ""very protective"" and ""very maternal"". Reflecting on her mother's personality, Eve adds: ""One wouldn't want to antagonise her because even though she had a big and generous heart, she could be rather volatile."" While Blouin was in exile, soldiers looted her family home and brutally beat her mother with a gun, permanently damaging her spine. Blouin's family were finally able to join her after months of separation. They spent a brief period in Algeria - where they were offered sanctuary by the country's first post-independence President, Ahmed Ben Bella. They then settled in Paris. Blouin remained involved in pan-Africanism from afar ""in the form of articles and almost daily meetings"", Eve wrote in the memoir's epilogue. When Blouin began writing her autobiography in the 1970s, she still had great reverence for the independence movements she had dedicated herself to. She had high praise for Sékou Touré, who by that point had established a one-party state and was ruthlessly suppressing freedom of expression. Blouin did however grow deeply despondent that Africa had not become ""free"", as she had hoped. ""It is not the outsiders who have damaged Africa the most, but the mutilated will of the people and the selfishness of some of our own leaders,"" she wrote. She grieved the death of her dream, so much so that she refused to take medication for the cancer that was ravaging her body. ""It was terrible to watch. I was absolutely powerless,"" Eve said. Blouin passed away in Paris on 9 April 1986, at the age of 65. According to Eve, her mother's death was met by the world with ""dreary indifference"". She remains an inspiration in some corners, however. In DR Congo's capital, Kinshasa, a cultural centre named after Blouin offers the likes of educational programmes, conferences, and film screenings - all underpinned by a pan-African ethos. And through My Country, Africa, Blouin's extraordinary story is being released for a second time, this time into a world that shows greater interest in the historical contributions of women. New readers will learn of the girl who went from being stashed away by the colonial system, to fighting for the freedom of millions of black Africans.

So he started a project called Kings Punks, where he collected and distributed toys for children living on the street on Three Kings day, also known as Epiphany, when children in Mexico typically receive gifts from the three wise men. “The bases of punk are mutual support and solidarity,” the 50-year-old said Sunday night as the gift drive was in full swing. Over the years many volunteers have joined his effort. Sporting black t-shirts from their favorite bands, black boots and glimmering piercings, the punks handed out scooters, dinosaurs and other gifts to children in the streets of Mexico’s capital early Monday. “Dealing with children and the way you get attached and can be supportive to them — that is priceless,” said Escobar, who is known locally as El Picos. “As we tell people: We don’t want diplomas, recognition or anything. We are punks, and that’s why we do it.” In more recent years, Escobar has expanded beyond just the places he knows Mexican families are living in the streets to also include some of Mexico City’s migrant encampments. Lucha libre wrestler Peter Punk – black tights and green and white mask – joined as well, participating in brief wrestling bouts on the pavement at each stop. Volunteers also string up a candy-filled piñata for children to bash. One of the volunteers is shoemaker Marcos Grande. This year, he brought seven pairs of his boots to give away. “The satisfaction of the children, bringing them a gift, a joy because many children do not have it, that is what is satisfying, taking it to where sometimes it does not reach, where they do not have the three kings but now here are friends, the group, the punks,” he said.",0,[],2025-01-06 15:11:14,2025-01-07 02:45:37

In a statement, Iberian Premium Fruits said the acquisition “consolidates its position as leader in the premium fruit sector in Spain and Europe”. Based in Albal, Valencia, The Natural Hand specialises in “premium quality” persimmons and citrus fruits. The acquisition allows Iberian Premium Fruits, based in Chilches near Malaga, to expand its market reach, particularly in Asia, to which The Natural Hand has been exporting since 2013. The addition of the Valencian company is expected to increase Iberian Premium Fruits’ farmland to more than 1,200 hectares across Spain and South Africa, featuring a portfolio of more than 25 varieties of oranges, clementines, persimmons and other products. The company also anticipates a 15% growth for the 2024/2025 campaign, expecting to reach €200m ($208.1m) in turnover due to this new integration. Iberian Premium Fruits, which was established in April 2023 following the merger of Llusar and Torres in 2021, aims to “become the largest European leader in the production and distribution of premium oranges and mandarins”.’ Its CEO, Xavi Nolla, said: “In our group we work so that the freshness, quality and unique flavour of our oranges, clementines and other fruits are our differentiating seal and a competitive advantage in the sector.” The Natural Hand director Juan Carlos Martínez describes joining the Iberian Premium Group as “the boost that the company needed to multiply its growth exponentially”. Under its new owner, The Natural Hand will move to new facilities in Alcácer, Valencia, spanning 14,000 square metres, tripling its production capacity. This expansion adds to Iberian Premium Fruits’ existing 89,000 square metres of facilities across various locations in Castellón and Valencia. In June 2023, the company expanded by acquiring V-ROS, a specialist in clementines with leaves.

Around 14% of German electricity consumption over the year was covered by photovoltaic systems, the association said. The top source of solar power in 2024 remained solar panels on residential buildings, contributing some 38 gigawatts in output. However, the prime driver of growth was ground-mounted solar parks, which provided more than one-third of new capacity at 6.3 gigawatts, an increase of 40% compared to the previous year. The expansion of plug-in solar devices, otherwise known as balcony power plants, also expanded in 2024, with capacity doubling to around 0.7 gigawatts. Solar modules on commercial roofs, meanwhile, accounted for just under 30% of total output. Here, the increase in new installations was around one-quarter compared to 2023.

Mondlane said he would arrive ahead of the swearing-in of a new president next week. Daniel Chapo of the ruling Frelimo party is due to be sworn next Wednesday after a court confirmed his election victory. But Mondlane, the runner-up, rejected the outcome, sparking violent protests that have left dozens dead since October. Mondlane left Mozambique the same month saying he feared for his life, after two of his aides were shot dead. In a Facebook live address on Sunday, he sent out a defiant message to the authorities saying he ""will be in Maputo. They don't need to chase me any more"". Children shot dead after joining pot-banging protests in Mozambique He said he would arrive at 08:05 local time (06:05 GMT) on Thursday at the international airport in Maputo, calling for people to welcome him there. ""If they are killing my brothers... then I will be there. You can do what you want. If you want to murder, murder. If you want to arrest, arrest too. I will be there,"" he said. Mondlane maintains that he won the election and has called for more protests until there is ""electoral truth"". His supporters have frequently staged violent protests across the country to demand an end to the 49-year-rule of the Frelimo party. He has previously said he would install himself as president on 15 January - on the presidential inauguration day - despite the court upholding his rival's victory. The electoral commission initially declared Chapo the winner of the election with 71% of the vote, compared to Mondlane's 20%. The final official results from the constitutional court two weeks ago gave Chapo 65% and Mondlane 24%. International election observers have previously said that the vote was flawed, pointing to doctored numbers and other irregularities during the counting process. Security forces have sought to end the nationwide protests in a violent crackdown that has tested the country's stability. More than 270 people have been killed, including protesters, children and members of the security forces, according to rights groups. The unrest has also affected the economy, with more than 12,000 people losing their jobs and over 500 companies being vandalised. Neighbouring countries have also been affected by the political unrest, with thousands of Mozambicans fleeing across the border.

Sarkozy, 69, was France’s president from 2007 to 2012.",SYLVIE CORBET,2025-01-06T11:25:14.000Z,"PARIS (AP) — France’s former President Nicolas Sarkozy goes on trial Monday over allegations he received millions from Libya for his 2007 successful presidential campaign, in the latest — and biggest — of a series of legal cases involving him. This comes after his conviction in a corruption case was made definitive by France’s highest court last month. Sarkozy, 69, was France’s president from 2007 to 2012. He retired from active politics in 2017. The former president has denied any wrongdoing. Here’s a look at the legal proceedings. Alleged Libya financing Sarkozy, along with 11 others, is accused of having received millions for his 2007 presidential campaign in illegal financing from the government of then-Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. Sarkozy has been under investigation in the case since 2013. He is charged with passive corruption, illegal campaign financing, embezzlement of Libyan public funds and criminal association. The trial is scheduled to run until April 10. Investigators examined claims that Gadhafi’s government secretly agreed to give Sarkozy up to 50 million euros ($51.6 million) for his 2007 campaign. The sum was more than double the legal campaign funding limit at the time, violating French rules. The investigation gained traction when French-Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine told news site Mediapart in 2016 that he had delivered suitcases from Libya containing 5 million euros (about $5.1 million) in cash to Sarkozy and his former chief of staff. Takieddine later withdrew the allegation and Sarkozy sought to have the inquiry closed. After becoming president in 2007, Sarkozy welcomed Gadhafi to France with high honors later that year. Sarkozy then put France at the forefront of NATO-led airstrikes that helped rebel fighters topple Gadhafi’s government in 2011. Accusations of witness tampering French investigative judges filed preliminary charges in 2023 against Sarkozy for his alleged involvement in an attempt to mislead magistrates in order to clear him in the Libya financing case. Financial prosecutors said Sarkozy is suspected of “benefitting from corruptly influencing a witness,” in reference to Takieddine. Sarkozy’s wife, former supermodel Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, was given preliminary charges in July last year for alleged involvement in efforts to pressure Takieddine. Bruni-Sarkozy was placed under judicial supervision, which includes a ban on contact with all those involved in the proceedings except for her husband. Wiretapping scandal France’s Court of Cassation on Dec. 18 upheld an appeal court decision that had found Sarkozy guilty of corruption and influence peddling while he was the country’s head of state. Sarkozy has been sentenced to a year in prison but is entitled to be detained at home with an electronic bracelet as provided by French law. He said he would bring the case to the European Court of Human Rights. Sarkozy was first found guilty in 2021 by a Paris court, a verdict confirmed in 2023 by an appeals court, for trying to bribe a magistrate in exchange for information about a legal case in which he was implicated. The case was revealed through wiretapped phone conversations during the Libya financing investigation. Convicted for illegal campaign financing In February last year, an appeals court in Paris upheld a guilty verdict against Sarkozy for illegal campaign financing in his failed 2012 reelection bid. He was sentenced to a year in prison, of which six months were suspended. The former president is accused of having spent almost twice the maximum legal amount of 22.5 million euros on the reelection bid that he lost to Socialist Francois Hollande. Sarkozy has denied all allegations and appealed to the highest Court of Cassation in that case.",5,[],2025-01-06 15:11:43,2025-01-07 02:48:56

It included a photo of a man in saffron-coloured headgear bowing before former Congress party chief Sonia Gandhi in what appears to be an attempt to touch her feet. The post surfaced days after the death of Manmohan Singh -- India's prime minister from 2004 to 2014 -- who was hailed for overseeing an economic boom in Asia's fourth-largest economy in his first term (archived link).

""Bar dancer"" refers to accusations by Gandhi's detractors that she worked as a bar dancer in Italy before she met Rajiv.

Russia has been seeking tech alternatives post-Ukraine invasion due to Western sanctions. A Russia-China AI partnership could raise concerns over censorship, among other issues. Russian President Vladimir Putin continues seeking to expand his challenge of the West's order — this time in tech. The Russian leader has ordered his government and Russian banking giant Sberbank to work with China on artificial intelligence, according to a December 30 post on the Kremlin's website. Putin instructed his government and Sberbank to ""ensure further cooperation with the People's Republic of China in conducting technological research and development in the field of artificial intelligence,"" according to the Kremlin's post. It was published three weeks after Putin announced a BRICS AI Alliance Network. Putin delegated Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and Sberbank CEO German Gref to lead the AI effort. A progress report is expected by April. Putin's instructions came 34 months after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which triggered sweeping Western sanctions against his regime. The trade restrictions have hit Russia's access to financial payments technologies, prompting the country to seek substitutes in the form of parallel imports and domestic substitutes. Russia has also been setting up alternative systems to process payments transactions and ship sanctioned oil around the world. However, finding tech alternatives to Western products has not been easy. A former top Russian finance official told Reuters in September 2022 that Russia would be using second-grade tech for years and spending ""huge resources"" to recreate what already exists. Goods heavily impacted by Western sanctions include semiconductor chips, aviation parts, and medical products. Sberbank CEO Gref said in April 2023 that graphics cards for AI and supercomputers were the hardest to substitute. The US has restricted sales of advanced computer chips to Russia since 2022 and further tightened restrictions on third-party chip exports to Russia last year. Alexander Vedyakhin, the first deputy CEO of Sberbank, told Reuters last month that Russia was six to nine months behind the US and China in AI in a range of parameters. Vedyakhin told the news agency that Russia would focus on developing large language models rather than building massive data centers. A potential Russia-China partnership in AI could cause concerns beyond sanctions skirting. China's foray into AI is raising concerns about censorship in the country, where expression is tightly controlled.

This luxury liquor from Guizhou province, known for its potency of up to 53%, has long been a symbol of wealth and status, particularly favoured by elites in real estate, finance and government. However, in these sectors, celebrations have grown increasingly rare. For decades, Kweichow Moutai, the world’s largest spirits maker by market capitalization, thrived alongside China’s economic boom. It is also available abroad, sold by specialist retailers in major cities and also online. Since going public in 2001, the state-owned company’s trajectory had only been upward. But in recent years, the trend on the trading floor has taken a downward turn. A faltering giant? Once a prized investment and a status symbol, Maotai is now grappling with waning demand and shifting consumer habits. The company did not respond to an interview request because the local propaganda authority did not grant the required authorization. In mid-September, a bottle of the best-selling Feitian Maotai cost the equivalent of up to $330 in specialist shops. This was a little, considering that the Moon Festival was approaching, for which the liquor is often bought. The festival, which is the second-biggest event in the country after the Lunar New Year, is a time people to give thanks for autmumn harvest. The decline in consumption and demand for spirits has contributed to the decline in Maotai prices, says analyst Guo Shiliang of the Jing platform. The market expert points out that the price had previously risen significantly for a long time. The liquor company is an example of how many companies have been dragged into the downward spiral by the real estate crisis, the weak labour market and the associated slump in consumption. The mood among foreign firms in China, the world's second-largest economy, is also poor, according to the Asia-based global trade research organization the Hinrich Foundation. China's business environment is growing more complex for multinational firms, according to a study published by the foundation. Some factors include stricter regulations, state support for local firms, Communist Party influence and geopolitical tensions - all of which are prompting foreign companies to rethink their strategies. Drinking less popular with younger people In addition, recent economic data did little to dispel doubts that China might not achieve its self-imposed growth target of around 5% this year. The government is now hastily trying to counteract this with economic measures, which has caused euphoria in the business world. However, analysts see this as more of a short-term boost. To see the markets grow again in the long term, structural economic reforms and support through government spending are needed, wrote the Chinese business magazine Caixin. Maotai needs more customers at a time when people have less money for the high-priced liquor made from millet and wheat. What's more, extended drinking bouts with high-percentage spirits are no longer as popular as they used to be among young Chinese. So the century-old traditional brand is trying to appeal to a younger audience with new beverage varieties. But it remains to be seen whether the new products will turn the tide for the company. Maotai is ‘hard currency’ The distiller has also been hit by the anti-corruption campaign launched years ago by Chinese President Xi Jinping. This year, another former Maotai executive faced severe consequences: Gao Weidong was sentenced to life imprisonment by a court in Guizhou for allegedly accepting bribes exceeding 110 million yuan (approximately $14 million) over his years as a company executive and in other provincial roles. Among other offenses, he was accused of using his position to grant access to the highly sought-after liquor. Because of its high price, Maotai has long been considered a popular bribe. Many officials are no longer allowed to accept it as a gift, and local governments have removed it from the list of drinks allowed at official receptions. State-owned companies have also changed their practices, as employees of various companies say off the record. Company bosses, for example, are spending less money on banquets for government officials, which is why there are fewer Maotai bottles on the table. One employee describes how being seen with Maotai can be tricky, especially if you work in procurement, for example. This has nothing to do with the economy, she says. Maotai is ""hard currency."" Many people store the bottles for years as an investment, in order to sell them later at a profit. But some Chinese people don't even drink the liquor. And the fact that connoisseurs say the drink doesn't cause headaches and is less harmful to the liver than other Chinese spirits isn't persuading anyone to order another round, either.",7,[],2025-01-06 15:12:12,2025-01-09 00:32:53

In laboratory tests, Trina's large surface area n-type fully passivated heterojunction (HJT) modules demonstrated an efficiency of 25.44%, according to the results certified by the Fraunhofer CalLab in Germany, a solar research body. Passivation is a technology that covers defects on the surface of a solar cell, while cell efficiency refers to the percentage of solar energy hitting a device that is converted into usable electricity. Increasing cell efficiency can help reduce the size needed for solar installations as well as cut costs. Professor Martin Green at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, whose lab held the solar cell efficiency record for decades, said the result demonstrated the potential of HJT solar technology, one of several contending to become the predominant next-generation technology for the sector. ""In the long run it's all about efficiency, so even if some sequences are at the moment more costly than others, what tends to happen is that as the industry gets itself into a new technology the cost comes down quite quickly,"" Green told Reuters. Trina's chairman and CEO Gao Jifan said the company will continue to increase its research and development in passivated solar technology to maintain its technology leadership. HJT remains a relatively small percentage of the market, estimated by solar consultancy InfoLink to make up 7% of high-efficiency solar cell capacity in 2024, 8% in 2025 and 9% in 2026. TopCON, or tunnel activated passive contact, cells are expected to make up the bulk of the market over the next five years. In addition to representing a record for HJT technology, the results are a new milestone for the photoelectric conversion efficiency of single-crystalline silicon solar cell modules, Trina said in the statement.

To accommodate additional people this winter including those from outside of New Bedford, additional funding has been requested from the state by Steppingstone, which has been partnering in this process to ensure as many people in need of shelter on cold nights as possible can be accommodated, according to a press release. In the meantime, Catholic Charities is providing emergency shelter through a “Cold Weather Overflow Shelter Project” to unsheltered homeless at a local motel (with a total of 15 units set aside and a total capacity of 30 beds for the overflow shelter). This will be offered when there is no vacancy at either of the Catholic Charities Shelters in New Bedford (Sister Rose and Grace House). The following information is provided to ensure clarity as to how the Cold Weather Overflow shelter will operate during the winter season 2024-2025: Massachusetts snow storm: Will Massachusetts be impacted by winter storm Blair? Conditions Activating the Shelter. The Cold Weather Overflow Shelter will be in operation during cold weather months (Nov. 15, 2024 to March 30, 2025) when temperatures are at, or below, 30 degrees and/or severe weather conditions such as a blizzard exist. Precipitation or snow alone doesn’t ensure that the overflow will open. Other factors are taken into consideration, coupled with the temperatures including “feel like” temps. As an example, if the temperature was expected to be at 32 degrees but the wind-chill coupled with rain or snow presents or “feels like” 25 degrees, then the overflow would be activated. Cold Weather Shelter Staff. The Cold Weather Overflow Shelter project team is composed of Catholic Charities, PAACA Recovery Support Center, and Best Security. Admission Into Shelter.  On a daily basis all Providers and Street Outreach teams, should direct all unsheltered individuals to contact Sister Rose/Grace House as early as 9:30 a.m. and no later than 1 p.m. to check on availability or to be put on a waitlist for those shelters. As beds become available individuals will be contacted for placement from the list. This helps in regard to hotel placement and number of expected guests on any given night. When the Emergency Assistance Shelters are at capacity and weather conditions warrant, the Cold Weather Overflow will be activated. Catholic Charities will send an activation email to providers informing everyone the cold shelter is open and the Bristol County CoC will post a notice on its Facebook page. Every year there have been grey area days where the team will do its best to make the right call. On days that we are expected to open, an email blast will be sent by noon. Transportation to the Shelter. Transportation will be provided by PAACA and all individuals will be picked up in the parking lot of Sister Rose House at 71 Division St. Transportation starts at 3 p.m. and based on 30 individuals PAACA provides roughly two trips. Individuals could also take alternative options such as SRTA buses or their own vehicles provided they registered on any given day to stay at the Cold Weather Overflow Shelter. PAACA also provides dinner at the motel when the Overflow is activated. What Does It Look Like When Folks Go into the Cold Weather Overflow Shelter? All inquiries can be forwarded to Sister Rose House. Guests are encouraged to call the office at 508-997-3202 to confirm if the Overflow will be activated. If so, then all individuals should plan to arrive in the parking lot entrance and line up accordingly. All individuals must be at least 18 years old. Men are assigned with men and women are assigned with women. All individuals are registered, and an ID will be provided to verify that all the parties have been registered through the season. Even though many unsheltered individuals are reluctant to accept services, all people are encouraged and asked if they would like to be added to the waitlist. Once registration is done (1 p.m. to 3 p.m.) transportation starts immediately. Once all individuals have arrived at the motel, the meals provided by PAACA are distributed to all individuals. Everybody is given a wakeup call between 5:30 and 6 a.m. and transportation will return everybody back to the parking lot of Sister Rose House. All parties must exit the motel by 6 a.m. Guidance related to COVID-19. All shelter guests must continue to comply with wearing a mask in shelter setting. As a reminder, the overflow will be activated on nights when the temperature is expected to be at 30 degrees or less. If the temperature drops to below 30 at 4 a.m. or 5 a.m. rather than 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. as an example, it doesn’t ensure that the overflow would open. All guests are expected to exit the motel by 6 a.m. Contact Elizabeth Neves or Ray Duarte of Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Fall River at 774-628-9743 or 508-997-3202 for any questions.

Jared Masseur, 40, of Nashua, faced Judge Mark Derby via teleconference from Hillsborough County House of Corrections during a hearing in Merrimack District Court on Monday. Masseur is charged with resisting arrest or detention, felon in possession of a dangerous weapon, attempting to take a firearm from a law enforcement officer, and second-degree assault. Derby ordered Masseur held without bail pending a probable cause hearing on Jan. 16. Bedford Police Officer David Benway-Fongemie, 24, was shot during a struggle with Masseur early Saturday, authorities said. Benway-Fongemie was shot and injured while officers were responding to a call around 12:53 a.m. Saturday about a suspicious person at Country Inn & Suites at 250 South River Road. When officers arrived, Masseur began to run away from them. Officers tried to take Masseur into custody, but he resisted and began to fight the officers. During a struggle with two officers, Masseur reached for Benway-Fongemie’s holster and tried to take his service firearm. The officer’s gun fired off during the struggle and shot Benway-Fongemie in the leg. Benway-Fongemie, who has worked for the department since September, was taken by ambulance to a local hospital. He  was later released and continues to recover at home. The shooting is the latest case of an officer on duty being shot after a suspect grabs their service weapon. In July, a Massachusetts man, Emmanuel Lopes, was sentenced to life in prison for fatally shooting Weymouth Police Department Sgt. Michael Chesna, 42, and innocent bystander Vera Adams, 77, with Chesna’s service weapon in July 2018. A jury convicted Lopes of the two murders in February. While fleeing the scene of a minor car crash on July 15, 2018, Lopes a large rock at Chesna, the responding officer, knocking him to the ground unconscious, then grabbed the police officer’s gun and fatally shot him multiple times, investigators said at the time. He also fatally shot Adams, a nearby resident who was on her porch. This is a developing story. Check back for updates as more information becomes available.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight) U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, reintroduced a bill Monday to protect 40 acres at the Wounded Knee Massacre site on behalf of the Oglala Sioux Tribe and Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. Johnson’s Wounded Knee Massacre Memorial and Sacred Site Act passed the House in 2023 but didn’t make it through the Senate last year. The new session of Congress began Friday. “I’m hopeful the bill passes this Congress to provide greater tribal sovereignty to this sacred land,” Johnson said in a news release. Fate uncertain for Wounded Knee land bill and medals review as massacre commemoration approaches The massacre occurred on Dec. 29, 1890. Lakota people were camped near Wounded Knee Creek on the Pine Ridge Reservation in southwestern South Dakota, where they were surrounded by hundreds of Army soldiers. A shot rang out while the soldiers tried to disarm the camp, and chaotic shooting ensued. Fewer than 40 soldiers were killed (some by friendly fire, according to historians), while estimates of Lakota deaths ran from 200 to 300 or more, depending on the source. After some of the bodies froze on the ground for several days, a military-led burial party dumped them into a mass grave. Two years ago, the two tribes purchased 40 acres at the massacre site from a private owner. The legislation would place the land in restricted-fee status, which means it could not be sold, taxed, gifted or leased without approval by Congress and both tribes. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-North Carolina, took advantage of rules last November allowing a single senator to block consideration of the bill in the Senate. Tillis has opposed several tribal-related bills in an attempt to get senators to support his own bill to federally recognize the Lumbee Tribe in North Carolina. He called out the leaders of the Oglala and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes for allegedly not supporting his efforts. Oglala Sioux Tribe President Frank Star Comes Out called the bill “wholly uncontroversial” in Johnson’s Monday news release. “This sacred site should forever serve to remind us of where we as a country have been and as a marker for how much further we have to go,” Star Comes Out said. Meanwhile, efforts to rescind medals of honor awarded to soldiers who participated in the massacre remain in limbo. The medals were subjected to a review last year by the Department of Defense, but there hasn’t been an announcement of the review panel’s recommendations.

To respect grieving families, West Greenwich Police Chief Francis N. Ramsay has not named any of the people who were in the home. Through the weekend and into Monday, Ramsay has anticipated that he will be in a position to provide further information on the situation, as soon as today or tomorrow, after medical examinations provide certain findings awaited by investigators. The extent of any new information that Ramsay would provide at that point still isn't clear. What is clear is that the death scene at 15 Cheyenne Trail points likely stems from an outbreak of gun violence in a domestic setting. The home in question is a single-story ranch in an area near Lake Mishnock. Most of the streets in the area have Native American names. Many of the homes are nestled amongst trees and festively decorated for the holidays. On Friday, a state police mobile crime lab was parked outside the house. A white four-door pickup truck was parked in the driveway alongside a smaller vehicle. Ramsay said police officers had initially gone to the house at 10:30 a.m. The officers were checking on the well-being of a resident who had not gone to work, he said. Outside the home, said Ramsay, the officers encountered ""suspicious circumstances."" They made a forced entry into the house. Inside, the officers found four bodies, Ramsay said. The bodies exhibited gunshot wounds and it appeared that gunfire was the cause of death, he said. State police and West Greenwich police are jointly investigating the deaths.

The group behind the effort submitted the petitions Monday and said they contain more than 170,000 signatures, far more than required to force a statewide vote. The Secretary of State's Office must now review and formally certify the petitions. Among other things, the proposal would require people to present a photo ID at the polls or when requesting an absentee ballot, unless they have a religious exemption to being photographed. Voters without a photo ID could cast a provisional ballot, which would be counted if they produce a photo ID within four days of the election. It would also require the secretary of state to provide free state nondriver IDs to people who need them. Enacting a statewide voter ID requirement has been proposed repeatedly by Republicans in the Maine Legislature in recent years, but has been blocked by Democrats, who have criticized the costs of such a program and warned that the new requirement would create long lines at the polls and effectively discourage voting. In order for citizen initiatives to get on the ballot, supporters must submit a required number of signatures from registered Maine voters to the secretary of state.

So about 10 years ago, she took the necessary training and joined a roster of private attorneys willing to accept court-appointed work — including parents who were at risk of losing custody of their children to the state. She said she quickly learned these families are often misunderstood. Many times, Owens said, she has seen the child protective system hurt her clients more than it's helped them. ""I couldn't possibly overstate the impact on families,"" Owens said in a recent interview. ""There's a fear that attaches and a trauma that attaches that doesn't go away."" Owens, who has worked in Washington and Hancock counties, was hired in September to lead the state's new Parents Counsel Division for the Maine Commission on Public Defense Services. As Maine moves toward creating a more traditional public defense system, relying less on private attorneys to step up and do indigent work, she is helping set up an office to exclusively represent parents in child protection matters. Like almost every other type of case moving through Maine's judicial system, parental cases rarely have enough lawyers to take on a client who can't afford an attorney on their own. According to data from the courts, judges were seeking lawyers in more than 100 parental cases across the state as of Friday. But only about 25 attorneys were available to take them, roughly a quarter of the number available two years ago. And most cases required at least two attorneys, since each parent is entitled to a representative of their own. Some attorneys have retired or are no longer practicing. Others have had to take on less work after the commission enacted new caseload standards. ""My message, really, is that this will take some time,"" Owens said. As she slowly builds out the new office, Owens said she wants to lay down the foundation for a system where attorneys aren't working alone, but have colleagues to lean on and strategize with. She wants a team who will challenge the status quo. Tackling the state's list of unrepresented parents will be a priority for her division — but she can only hire three attorneys to start, and in the meantime, the Department of Health and Human Services, embroiled in its own crises over protecting children, continues to file new cases. Several attorneys who represent parents told the Press Herald that they feel the department is filing more petitions than the system can handle. The Office of the Maine Attorney General, which represents the state when DHHS chooses to file a petition, was unable to provide yearly data in time for this story. These attorneys described their work with both passion and exhaustion. They have represented parents who want the best for their children but are often in crisis, they said, many dealing with domestic violence, mental illness, substance use disorder or serious poverty. Yet research shows that removals can have negative long-term consequences on children and their development. Child protective workers also have raised concerns with their agency's capacity to handle more cases. There aren't enough placements for children after they've been removed. Some are waiting in hotels. ""It is indicative of the fact they are removing too many kids,"" said Julian Richter, an attorney in Bath and president of the Maine Parental Rights Attorneys Association. ""It's just creating more trauma for the kids. You're not considering the off-set there, whether could they have been safer in their own home."" 'WE BELIEVE IN THIS WORK' Any time the Office of Child and Family Services, which is overseen by DHHS, files a petition for a child protection order, Maine parents are legally entitled to an attorney at no cost and a hearing within 120 days to challenge the department's case. Oftentimes, the state will also request to immediately remove the child from their home. In those cases, parents are entitled to a faster hearing within one to two weeks to establish whether there's an immediate risk. These orders typically include an attorney's name and contact information. That way, the parent can get started on mounting their case, which is more urgent if there's a request for immediate removal. If a parent would rather work with the state and make changes for a safer home, then attorneys can help them navigate mental health services, substance use treatment, housing aid and other programs. They can also demand help from the department. But as Maine struggles to find attorneys, judges are increasingly leaving that section of their orders blank. Still, even without representation, the department is allowed to remove children, and crucial court dates that will determine when they can come home are being delayed. In one parent's case, Richter said a mother waited two months for an immediate risk hearing. ""And I think that's not an uncommon situation at this point,"" Richter said. ""Especially when a kid has been removed, that's when you're really talking about a constitutional crisis of sorts."" As of Jan. 3, there were roughly 115 child protective cases that needed lawyers. Some of those cases date back as far as April. More than half were added within the last two months. When Lewiston courts needed help finding attorneys for about 55 parents in Lewiston last fall, Taylor Kilgore said she went through each of their files and appealed to her peers to take them on. She found counsel for 21 parents. ""We hate seeing that list,"" said Kilgore, an attorney who has represented parents and children in Turner. ""We do this work because we believe in this work. Seeing that list regularly and seeing there are parents without counsel is heartbreaking for us, and it is infuriating."" ONE OF MANY ISSUES As the state's child welfare ombudsman, Christine Alberi investigates complaints from various people who come into contact with the system and releases an annual report to lawmakers. Alberi hears often from parents whose children have been removed. But it wasn't until the last year or so that she started hearing more about lawyers. She said she is concerned that children are spending more time away from their parents because court dates keep getting put off. Without a lawyer, many parents don't know whether they can still see their kids or maintain contact. Parents' attorneys are often the ones who apply pressure on the department when it struggles to arrange supervised visits. ""Visitation, is probably the most important part of the reunification process,"" said Alberi. ""It's most important for the kids. Regardless of anything else, the kids love their parents. And it's really key that the kids see their parents and understand they haven't been abandoned, it isn't their fault. The visits are really, primarily, for the children."" Robin Upton-Sukeforth, a union representative for the state's child protective workers, said her members are feeling unprecedented levels of stress. There are more children in state custody now than ever in the last 20 years, hitting about 2,500 in September. And because court cases take longer to process when parents are unrepresented, this is only adding to their work. ""You're putting the kids in limbo,"" Upton-Sukeforth said, speaking for a handful of caseworkers who did not want to be interviewed. ""I can't imagine having a kid in limbo for that long."" Caseworkers have been under a lot pressure after several recent high-profile child deaths in homes where parents had been investigated for abuse or neglect. Attorneys who have represented parents say those cases are the exception. They feel too much effort has been placed on encouraging overworked caseworkers to be more aggressive, instead of increasing in-home behavioral health services. ""What a lot of people don't understand is that it's incredibly scary when the department knocks at your door and says, 'We need to see the inside of your house and talk with your child in the next 24 hours.' Anybody who has kids is going to be unable to function in that moment,"" Richter said. STRUCTURAL CHANGE As lawyers, caseworkers and families endure the growing crisis, the Parents Counsel Division's work will depend on what Maine is willing to invest. Owens hired her first staff attorney on Thursday and is still taking applications for two others. It's unclear where the attorneys will be based. Public defense is still relatively new to Maine, which didn't launch its first office for criminal cases until late 2022. She hopes that her team will create systemic change. Similar agencies in other states, including the Children and Family Law Division of the Massachusetts Committee for Public Counsel Services, say they have successfully expanded parents' rights. In one 2017 case, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court sided with CAFL and ruled that the state must show it made ""reasonable efforts"" to avoid separating children. When the department hasn't done that, a judge can issue orders to accelerate the reunification process. In another case from 2021, a judge agreed with CAFL that parents are allowed to request a hearing when they believe Massachusetts has failed to make reasonable efforts to reunite families. In that case, the state had ordered a mother to take parenting classes and complete a neuropsychological evaluation. The department had resources available to help her, but they didn't connect her with a provider who spoke Somali Mai Mai, her primary language. ""They definitely have moved the ball forward in terms of giving our attorneys more arguments to push against the department not making efforts,"" said CAFL's Deputy Chief Counsel Daniel Mahoney. Attorneys representing parents in Maine are hopeful that the new division will be successful. But even if the state had a lawyer for every parent, some say the system would still be flawed. ""We need to be putting the energy into all of the parts for it to get better,"" said Kilgore, the attorney in Turner. ""Some of them just get caught in the system, and some of them are just trying to do the best they can with what they've got. If we want to fix those problems, we have to give them resources.""

Maj. Kevin Sucher last week took the reigns over Troop E from commander Maj. Miklos Szoczei, who retired in the fall, said New York State Police Trooper Lynnea Crane. A Wayne High School and Monroe Community College graduate, Sucher became a trooper in May 1999. He lives in Ontario, Wayne County, with his family. In a news release, Sucher was described as a ""highly experienced and dedicated member"" of the department with ""extensive experience"" and an ""unwavering commitment"" to public safety, forensic science, narcotics enforcement and criminal investigation. Sucher spent roughly 15 years of his career in Troop E's Forensic Identification Unit - as an investigator, a sergeant and then a supervisor. He briefly served in Troop NYC and NYSP's narcotics enforcement team in 2018. Since 2019, Sucher held a variety of leadership roles within Troop E, including zone commander and as the captain of Bureau of Criminal Investigation. But before Sucher was a sworn officer, his first job within the department started in 1990, when he worked as an assistant mechanic in the Troop E maintenance garage. In this role, Sucher helped set up new police vehicles and provided general mechanical services. ""This hands-on beginning has given him a deep appreciation for the diverse roles within the State Police and the importance of teamwork at every level of the organization,"" Crane said in a news release.

In a 17-page filing Monday, Trump’s lawyers announced that the president-elect would seek an automatic stay on his sentencing, challenging New York State Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan’s rejection of presidential immunity claims. Trump’s lawyers argued that the Supreme Court’s decision in Trump v. United States required a stay of all trial proceedings, as Trump had been granted presidential immunity for official acts. They also argued that Merchan had wrongly denied Trump’s request to have the verdict dismissed on those same grounds. “Due to the fact that further criminal proceedings are automatically stayed by operation of federal constitutional law, the Court will lack authority to proceed with sentencing, must therefore immediately vacate the sentencing hearing scheduled for January 10, 2025, and suspend all proceedings in the case until the conclusion of President Trump’s appeal on Presidential immunity,” Trump’s lawyers wrote. The lawyers requested a response from the court on whether they intend to proceed with the sentencing by the end of Monday. Last week, Merchan ordered that Trump attend a sentencing hearing on January 10, a little more than a week before his inauguration. Merchan made clear in his order that he did not plan to levy a sentence of jail time, fines, or probation against the president-elect. Instead, Merchan said he plans to sentence Trump with “unconditional discharge,” which means he will receive no punishment. Over the weekend, Trump published several angry posts ranting against the “RIGGED” case and claiming his innocence—to which a jury of his peers did not agree. “I never falsified business records. It is a fake, made up charge by a corrupt judge who is just doing the work of the Biden/Harris Injustice Department, an attack on their political opponent, ME!” Trump wrote. Lodged within Trump’s diatribes, the president-elect signaled his hopes to use his conviction as the pretext for a new authoritarian rule.",0,[],2025-01-06 19:16:31,2025-01-06 19:19:55

His body was finally found Saturday afternoon in the icy Cass River near Heritage Park in Frankenmuth by a dive team. The preliminary cause of death: Drowning. It's unclear, however, what he was doing near the river. Bacon, a Navy veteran who also went by his middle name, Loren, reportedly had arrived at the hotel, a popular vacation destination, at about 6:40 p.m. on Dec. 27. He reportedly went to change and was going to meet one of his two daughters, ages 15 and 13. And then, he vanished.

Even The Daily Mail, a British tabloid, published a version of the sensational story. Since Bacon's disappearance was reported, the local police department said it — and more than a dozen other agencies — had frantically searched for him, even using dogs and drones to try to track and locate him. But how Bacon — a 5-foot-7 guy with blue eyes and gray hair — ended up in the river is baffling. According to his ex-wife, Melissa McLenna, he was feeling upbeat and left the hotel undetected by surveillance cameras. More: Police finally solve homicide of 7-year-old Michigan boy after 65 years She also told a TV station, however, that he liked nature and tended to ""check things out.""

Not long after that, she added: ""I am turning off my phone we need to have time together without the phone. I just want to say thank you to everyone. we as a family really appreciate everything. We'll have more updates as to the next steps soon."" McLenna said earlier in the week in news reports that Bacon went to move his car, and that video shows him going to the inn’s fun center, but never exiting the building. Not all of the exits, she said, have cameras. She also said their younger daughter said Bacon was in ""a great mood,"" and speculated that he might have gone outside because he loves nature, and, she added, she ""wouldn’t put it past him to come outside to smoke a cigarette and walk along that river.""

On Jan. 6, 2025, the conflict has evolved to include a war against the recent past.",Steve Benen,2025-01-06T17:26:58.000Z,"In the days leading up to the fourth anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, President Joe Biden made little effort to hide the fact that the insurrectionist riot was on his mind. Indeed, last week, the retiring incumbent awarded Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi and former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming — the leaders of the now-defunct bipartisan Jan. 6 committee — with the Presidential Citizens Medal. A few days later, during an exchange with reporters at the White House, Biden said, in reference to the Jan. 6 assault, “I think it should not be rewritten. I don’t think it should be forgotten.” On the anniversary of the Trump-inspired violence, the Democratic president went further, writing an opinion piece for The Washington Post. An unrelenting effort has been underway to rewrite — even erase — the history of that day. To tell us we didn’t see what we all saw with our own eyes. To dismiss concerns about it as some kind of partisan obsession. To explain it away as a protest that just got out of hand. This is not what happened. In time, there will be Americans who didn’t witness the Jan. 6 riot firsthand but will learn about it from footage and testimony of that day, from what is written in history books and from the truth we pass on to our children. We cannot allow the truth to be lost. Part of what makes this so notable is the degree to which it captures where things stand in relation to the public discourse. Four years after the violent, we could certainly have another conversation about Donald Trump standing by for hours as a mob of his supporters attacked his own country’s Capitol, as part of a bid to claim illegitimate power in the wake of an election defeat. We could review anew what the rioters did, their intentions, their motivations, their weapons, their enablers, their willingness to violently clash with law enforcement, and even their terrifying proximity to then-Vice President Mike Pence. But on the fourth anniversary of one of the most important examples of domestic political violence in our nation’s history, perhaps no element of the conversation is more important than the ongoing crusade to bully Americans’ memories into submission. On Jan. 6, 2021, Trump and his allies engaged in a war against democracy. On Jan. 6, 2025, the conflict has evolved to include a war against the recent past. Four years ago at this time, Trump was a defeated failure whose pathetic political career lay in ruins, and there was a broad agreement among officials in both parties that he deserved to be held accountable for his role in inciting the attack. The riot was so indefensible that the initial line from some Republicans was that the violence should be blamed on far-left Antifa radicals who were, the absurd theory posited, only pretending to be Trump supporters. Variations on these ridiculous conspiracy theories continue to be popular in conservative circles, with related nonsense about the FBI being secretly responsible for encouraging rioters to commit crimes. Paradoxically, while too many Republicans have implicitly conceded that the attack was atrocious — while trying to steer the blame against those who actually bear responsibility, of course — others in the party have decided to recast the villains as heroes and victims. The New York Times published a striking report on the GOP’s “inverted interpretation,” which “defied what the country had watched unfold”. That day was an American calamity. Lawmakers huddled for safety. Vice President Mike Pence eluded a mob shouting that he should be hanged. Several people died during and after the riot, including one protester by gunshot and four police officers by suicide, and more than 140 officers were injured in a protracted melee that nearly upended what should have been the routine certification of the electoral victory of Mr. Trump’s opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr. But with his return to office, Mr. Trump now has the platform to further rinse and spin the Capitol attack into what he has called “a day of love.” He has vowed to pardon rioters in the first hour of his new administration, while his congressional supporters are pushing for criminal charges against those who investigated his actions on that chaotic day. Given my recent book about Republican efforts to rewrite recent history, this is a subject of particular interest to me, and my chapter on Jan. 6 is arguably the most important in the text. Indeed, part of what makes the right’s gambit so extraordinary is the obvious fact that rewriting the story seemed impossible at the time. The indelible video and images were simply too powerful to ignore or forget. The rioters on the Senate floor. The guns drawn at the entry to the House chamber. The noose displayed on a gallows. The “hang Mike Pence” chants. The plastic zip-tie handcuffs. The elected officials running to safety. The Confederate flag that never reached Capitol Hill during the Civil War, but which was carried down congressional hallways in January 2021. A rioter grinning with apparent pride as he put his foot on the speaker of the House’s desk. The insurrectionists breaking into the building, climbing its walls, violently clashing with law enforcement, all while Trump flags waved around them. The chilling footage was seen by too many people, domestically and around the world, for reality to yield. The details surrounding the attack — from its perpetrators to its instigators, its purpose to its effects, its organizers to its victims — were too well documented by investigators, policymakers, journalists, and prosecutors. The idea of a political party even attempting to rewrite the story of the assault seemed preposterous. It would not happen. It could not happen. That is, until Republicans decided it had to happen.

Trump “’has repeatedly pledged to pardon U.S. Capitol rioters on Day One’,” an attorney for Fleming Island home remodeler Marcus Smith reminded a federal judge in Washington Friday, quoting news coverage as the lawyer asked to delay Smith’s sentencing for destroying government property during the Jan. 6, 2021, riot by Trump supporters. U.S. District Judge Dabney L. Friedrich rejected the request and kept Smith, 48, scheduled for sentencing three days before Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration for his second term in office. Sunshine links: Florida still has the most people facing January 6 insurrection charges. It’s not even close. Smith could be sentenced to up to 10 years behind bars for his part in damaging an 1850s mahogany door in the Capitol’s Senate wing, estimated to cost about $21,000 to replace. Some judges have recently delayed cases involving other Jan. 6 defendants such as Jake Lang, a New Yorker who tweeted a New Year’s Day message that “2025 will be forever … known as the year GOD SET FREE the J6ers.” Whether Jan. 6 rioters will be pardoned wholesale is one of countless unknowns about the second Trump presidency, and Smith attorney Kevin A. Tate's delay request acknowledged that “certainly there is no guarantee Mr. Smith will be pardoned.” If pardons come, these Northeast Florida Northeast Florida residents might get out of prison early: ∎ Anthony L. Sargent, 48, of St. Augustine, was sentenced to five years behind bars in December 2023 for a felony conviction of civil disorder and a series of misdemeanor charges. The U.S. Justice Department said Sargent grabbed and pushed a police officer who tried to detain a rioter; shoved two officers away from the Capitol while they tried to retreat; and twice threw “a heavy object” at Capitol doors police were standing behind, urging others to do the same. Close by: Jan 6. inmates from Georgia await pardon, release from jail: 'We're going home, boys!' The agency said that before the riot, Sargent stated his support for a riot and for civil war on a messaging platform of the right-wing Proud Boys extremist group. Sargent is at Federal Correctional Institution Jesup in South Georgia, scheduled for release in February 2028, according to a federal Bureau of Prisons website. ∎ Daniel Paul Gray, 44, of Jacksonville, is also at Jesup, serving a 30-month sentence for struggling with a female police officer during the riot. Gray, who is scheduled for release in February 2026, told a judge before his sentencing he had “no one to blame but myself for my actions.” Blanket pardons could also relieve strain on these people awaiting trial for riot-related charges: ∎ Garth Walton, 33, was arrested in Nassau County in July and is awaiting trial on charges including assaulting, resisting or impeding officers and obstructing law enforcement during a civil disorder as well as several misdemeanors. ∎ Palatka resident Dylan Swinehart, 24, was charged in August with four misdemeanors involving entering a restricted building and disorderly or disruptive conduct. He has pleaded not guilty and his charges are still hanging over him. People who’ve already served time behind bars might also feel some benefit (maybe limited) if a pardon removed some restrictions that still control how they live their lives. For example, Macclenny resident Bradley Weeks served a 10-month sentence for charges including the felony of obstructing an official proceeding before the U.S. Supreme Court decided that charge shouldn’t have been applied to some riot defendants. He was resentenced to the time he had already served, but until February is still under home detention with and location monitoring as part of a “supervised release” that followed his time locked up.  That meant that when Weeks, a photographer, was hired for a photo shoot in North Georgia, his lawyers had to ask a judge last month to approve a special order allowing him to travel farther than his release normally allows. At least 11 people from Jacksonville and nearby counties were charged in connection to the riot, but some have already completed sentences and might not be affected by pardons.

Here is what to know about the case. Junius Jackson, 38, of Green Bay. Jackson is charged in Brown County with: Attempted first-degree intentional homicide, with a dangerous weapon, domestic abuse assessments, Felony A. Disorderly conduct, with a dangerous weapon, domestic abuse assessments, Misdemeanor B. Two counts of bail jumping, Misdemeanor A. Bail jumping, domestic abuse assessments, Misdemeanor A. According to a criminal complaint: At 11:12 p.m. Dec. 31, Green Bay police officers responded to an apartment in the 1600 block of Harold Strett for a reported stabbing. On arrival, officers found a woman with a stab wound on the right side of her stomach and second stab wound near her armpit on her left side. No one else was inside the apartment. At the scene, Jackson's mother, who called 911, told police Jackson and the victim were at her house before leaving to get food and go home. The victim later called Jackson's mother, stating she was done with Jackson and she couldn't do it anymore. Just after, Jackson's mother heard the victim shout that Jackson was stabbing her. Jackson's mother said she could hear him shouting that he was sick of the victim and that he was going to kill her and then himself. A witness in the apartment building who also called 911 said that around 11 p.m. they heard loud arguing from upstairs and around 11:05 p.m. heard a man say ""Someone has to get this (expletive deleted)."" The witness said they then heard a woman say, ""He got me, he got me good."" A second witness in the apartment building said they heard what sounded like a body being slammed and a voice saying something along the lines of, ""I'll kill you."" Officers found a black kitchen knife in the doorway of the back bedroom, as well as blood on the carpet and what looked like an employee card badge. Blood was also found in other locations in the apartment. The victim told officers Jackson had been drinking and using crack cocaine. She said he stabbed her with the small kitchen knife and beat her in the face in the bedroom before fleeing in a Chevrolet Malibu. An officer got in contact with Jackson through his mother's phone, but Jackson refused to share his location. On the phone call, stated multiple times that he wanted to kill himself. Jackson later called back making suicidal statements and gave no further indication of his whereabouts. Jackson was arrested by Wisconsin State Patrol near Menasha on Interstate 41 northbound. In a interview with a detective, Jackson repeatedly said he did not know what happened that night or why he had blood on him. He asked the detective what happened and cried when told his wife was injured. He stated several times that he and his wife had argued and he left the apartment. Around two hours into the interview, Jackson stated he and his wife were fighting and he sliced her with a knife. He said he thought he sliced her once with the knife, he could not recall any words he or his wife said and that he didn't see any blood or know he had blood on him until the detective pointed it out. Jackson told the detective about prior domestic disturbances, stating that his wife was the aggressor. Jackson said he wouldn't call the police but his wife would. When leaving the interview, Jackson talked about being sorry and prayed for the victim. Jackson made his initial appearance in court on Jan. 3. He is scheduled to have a preliminary hearing on Jan. 13. Jackson is currently being held in Brown County Jail on a $500,000 bail.

Meteorologists predict increased precipitation later this week, which is likely to bring icy conditions and snow to parts of the state: North Texas is likely to get 1 to 4 inches of snow, according to one forecast, while Central Texas could see ice. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas has issued a weather watch until Friday but has not requested that Texans reduce their power usage. “At this time, grid conditions are expected to be normal, and there is no current expectation of an energy emergency,” ERCOT said in a written statement, adding that it will continue to monitor weather conditions closely. Energy supply is comfortably exceeding demand. As of Monday morning, the state’s operating reserves — or the energy that can be quickly deployed in the event of a sudden outage — stand at 12,000 megawatts, far above the threshold of 2,500 megawatts when emergency measures would begin. The National Weather Service urged caution as wintry conditions are expected to persist through the week. Untreated roads could become slick with ice, especially Thursday and Friday, making travel treacherous. The Texas Division of Emergency Management is recommending that Texans stock up on groceries, check on neighbors, protect vulnerable pipes and plants, and stay informed as the cold snap continues. This week’s frigid temperatures come from a familiar culprit: the polar vortex. Typically confined to the Arctic region, the vortex is a band of strong winds that at times can weaken and move south, bringing extreme cold air to the U.S., as far south as Texas. This weather pattern is similar to what spawned Winter Storm Uri, a February 2021 blast of arctic air that brought snow, ice and subfreezing temperatures to Texas and caused the near-collapse of the state grid. The storm triggered widespread power outages that left millions in the dark and cold for days, killed hundreds of people and brought sweeping changes to the state’s grid operations.",0,[],2025-01-06 19:17:24,2025-01-06 22:01:12

A primer.",,US,Milwaukee Journal Sentinel,3 min read,Lake-effect snow typically happens when the lakes are ice-free and the water is still relatively warm. Two other conditions need to coincide.,"Caitlin Looby, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel",2025-01-06T17:20:36.000Z,"There's that phrase again: Milwaukee, Racine and Kenosha counties could be hit by ""lake effect snow"" early this week. So, what exactly is lake effect snow? We know it's a big part of living in the Great Lakes, especially in certain areas. But does it make our weather better? Worse? Different with each mile away from the shoreline? Here's a basic primer. Lake-effect snow typically happens when the lakes are ice-free and the water is still relatively warm. As winter drags on, presumably cooling the water and perhaps forming ice sheets, the chances dissipate. However, lake-effect snow can hit as late as February and March if the conditions line up. Two conditions need to coincide for lake-effect snow to happen. First, cold air needs to travel across warm water. The cold, dry air acts like a sponge and sucks up moisture and heat from the lakes. The larger the temperature difference between air and water, the heavier the snowfall. The lake also needs to be ice-free because ice acts as a barrier, preventing moisture from evaporating off the lake. The magic number for the temperature difference is 23 degrees between the water and the air temperature at 5,000 feet. The second factor is wind direction, or what's called a lake's ""fetch,"" which is the distance that wind travels over open water. The longer the fetch, the more time the cold, dry air mass has to suck up warm water along the way. Depending on what direction the wind is moving, it can spend a lot of time over the open water. When the moist, warmed air finally hits land, it cools and dumps heavy snow. Cities and industrial areas can intensify these events because they generate additional heat. Lake-effect snow typically falls within 25 miles of the lake, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Sometimes, though, it can travel as far as 100 miles. Because jet streams by and large move from west to east, the eastern side of the Great Lakes historically have seen more lake-effect snow. Cities along Lake Erie and Lake Ontario are particularly prone to these intense events because of the long fetches that allow air to pick up a lot of moisture. Places like Michigan’s Upper Peninsula and Grand Rapids also frequently experience these heavy snowfall events. That's not to say places along the eastern shoreline of Wisconsin, like Milwaukee, don't see lake-effect snow. But it's much less likely, because there would need to be a weather pattern coming from the northeast, Wright said. Meteorologists can usually forecast when a lake-effect event will happen days in advance, but predicting what specific city will take the hit can be tricky. Any changes in the wind direction can drastically change the fetch over the water. This article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Every winter, we use the phrase 'lake effect snow.'

FDOT is also hosting a virtual and in-person meeting on Tuesday at 5 p.m. at the Hagen Ranch Road Library west of Delray Beach to present information on and take questions about the upgrades on West Atlantic Avenue, from State Road 7 to Florida's Turnpike, scheduled to start this month. Virtual attendees must register online at https://bit.ly/Atlantic-Ave-Project. Those attending in person can do so at 14350 Hagen Ranch Road. FDOT has not yet detailed planned road closures when construction starts. The department expects the project to be complete in summer 2028. Upgrades include widening Atlantic Avenue to four lanes between State Road 7 and Lyons Road — two each going east and west — from the current two in most of this stretch. FDOT will also widen the road to six lanes from four between Lyons Road and the turnpike. The State Road 7 intersection will get a third northbound and southbound lane, along with a second northbound right-turn lane. The Lyons Road intersection will get two left turn lanes and a right-turn lane in each direction. Road crews will also build six-foot sidewalks and seven-foot bike lanes along this stretch of Atlantic Avenue. FDOT expects the project to cost $26 million. The infrastructure law President Joe Biden signed in 2021 is contributing more than $12 million to upgrades along this nearly two-mile stretch of Atlantic Avenue.

It's a great alternative to driving.,,Lifestyle,INSIDER,5 min read,"Amtrak Winter Park Express, aka the ""Ski Train,"" runs from Denver to Winter Park ski resort from December to March. Here's why it's a good deal.",Molly O'Brien,2025-01-06T17:16:20.000Z,"I took the Amtrak Winter Park Express, also called the ""Ski Train,"" from Denver to Winter Park. The affordable two-hour train ride was pleasant and had wonderful views. I loved dodging traffic and not having to drive — plus, the train tracks were steps from the resort. Those who want to visit the mountains in Colorado without the hassle of driving may want to try the Amtrak Winter Park Express. Affectionately nicknamed the ""Ski Train,"" it is a fantastic option for going from Denver to Winter Park ski resort for a day in the snow. Its service typically begins in late December and runs through the end of March. Fares for the two-hour ride start at $19, depending on the date you book tickets. My round-trip ticket from Friday, December 20, to Saturday, December 21, cost $58. Here's what my ""Ski Train"" ride was like. The trains felt perfectly scheduled for maximum skiing time in Winter Park. My train was scheduled to leave Denver Union Station around 7 a.m. to arrive in Winter Park around 9 a.m. — right as its ski lifts open for the day. I live just outside downtown Denver, so I woke up at 6 a.m. to drive to the parking garage adjacent to Union Station, where I'd booked an overnight parking spot. I arrived at the tracks around 6:20 for my 6:30 boarding time. My return trip would depart Winter Park at 4:35 p.m. (right after the ski lifts close) and arrive in Denver around 7 p.m. Boarding was pretty easy. The train allows riders to take their skis or snowboards as a single carry-on item. Since passengers can bring two carry-on items and one personal item on board, I was able to travel with my skis, overnight bag, and a small backpack. While boarding the train, I passed my equipment to an Amtrak team member, who placed them in a special storage area. I had no problem finding a seat on the train. All seats on this train are coach — there are no business or first-class options. As the train filled up, I had no trouble finding a seat. Seats were arranged in pairs (or clusters of four), and I felt quite comfortable. They can recline slightly and most have pull-down tray tables, similar to what you'd find on a plane. The energy on the train was excellent. Many of my fellow passengers seemed excited and buzzing with energy — you'd never know it was barely 7 a.m. As the train exited the station, some of them started cheering. The vibes on the train ride were excellent overall. Even our lively conductor made sure to stop and chat with each passenger while checking tickets. I tried to get work done but ended up looking out the window for most of the trip. I and many other passengers had our laptops out to use during the ride. Unfortunately, we lost cellphone service about 30 minutes into the trip, and I wasn't able to use my hot spot or do much on my computer after that. Fortunately, I was able to spend most of the trip looking out the window at the stunning mountain scenery. I spent most of my trip in the dining car because I loved its windows. My favorite spot on the train was the dining car, which had domed windows on top and large ones on either side. It had the best views. This car also had snacks and drinks for sale, so I bought myself a hot coffee. After almost two hours, we began to approach our final stop. The highly relaxing trip took roughly two hours in total. When we went through Moffat Tunnel on the final stretch of the journey, an Amtrak employee told us it was time to put on our ski gear because we were just minutes away from Winter Park Resort. Our train stop was wildly close to the Winter Park slopes. We pulled into the train platform shortly after 9 a.m., and I could see the ski runs right out the train windows. Amtrak employees unloaded our skis and snowboards for us, and we stepped off the train platform and right onto Winter Park grounds. Seriously, I couldn't believe how close the train tracks were to the ski hill. We were less than 50 steps from Winter Park's base ski lift and village area, where we could grab a bite to eat, rent a ski locker or equipment for the day, and buy a lift pass. Overall, the train could be an excellent alternative to driving to Winter Park. The Amtrak journey to Winter Park wasn't overly expensive and felt highly efficient. It was a great alternative to driving to the mountain. Although I've been told driving from downtown Denver can be a slightly shorter trip at around 90 minutes, that doesn't factor in traffic. Winter Park can get really congested during peak ski seasons, so I was happy to not be stuck in a car. Plus, since I wasn't driving, I was able to fully embrace the stunning mountain views around me. The only real downside for me was that I couldn't bring my dog as the train is not pet-friendly. Read the original article on Business Insider",0,[],2025-01-06 19:17:24,2025-01-06 19:19:55

Christopher Tilley, 41, of Seabrook, entered a nolo contendere plea on Friday in Rockingham Superior Court to one misdemeanor count of simple assault. He had been indicted in 2023 on two counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault, but those charges were dropped as part of the plea agreement by the Rockingham County attorney’s office. A nolo plea means Tilley is accepting the charge and agreeing to the sentence without pleading guilty or not guilty. As part of the negotiated deal, Tilley will receive a one-year jail sentence, which will be suspended for three years under the condition he remains on good behavior. A notice of nolle prosequi, which refers to a dropped charge, was filed by Rockingham County Assistant County Attorney Roger Chadwick on Friday. Rockingham County Attorney Patricia Conway did not immediately respond to an inquiry into why the aggravated felonious sexual assault charges were dropped. A New Hampshire court phone operator said no date has been set for Tilley’s plea and sentencing.

The new simple assault charge alleges that Tilley ""purposely caused unprivileged contact"" with the victim by ""having her sit in his lap."" Tilley has been with the Seabrook Fire Department since 2013. He was placed on administrative leave after his arrest. Town Manager Bill Manzi said Friday he was aware of Tilley's plea.

Similar numbers were predicted in the Hudson Valley and on Long Island. “Most places that see light snow could see a coating to several tenths with some areas in southern parts of the city possibly approaching an inch,” NWS forecasters wrote Monday morning. “However, latest trends suggest it may be very difficult to see an inch.” South of the city it was a different story, with much of New Jersey expected to see multiple inches of snow. In South Jersey, up to 9 inches were expected in some areas. Chilly temperatures, about 10 degrees below average, kept residents cold across the tristate area. The projected high on Monday was 31 degrees, with an overnight low of 22.

The Public Service Enterprise Group, the company contracted to construct the MPRP, ...","Thomas Goodwin Smith, The Baltimore Sun",2025-01-06T17:12:00.000Z,"BALTIMORE — Carroll lawmakers plan to support bills that would support alternative energy solutions and restrict government-granted eminent domain powers, amid the pending approval of the Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project, a 70-mile power line that would run through Carroll, Frederick and Baltimore counties. The Public Service Enterprise Group, the company contracted to construct the MPRP, applied Tuesday for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity from the Maryland Public Service Commission. PJM, the organization responsible for operating and planning Maryland’s electric grid, has contracted with PSEG to build the $424 million project, projected to be operational by June 1, 2027. “PJM determined through its federally regulated regional transmission expansion planning process that the MPRP is critically needed to prevent severe, extensive, and widespread reliability violations on the existing 500 kV transmission system that serves Maryland and its surrounding states,” according to the application’s cover letter. “If unaddressed, these violations could compromise overall system reliability in the PJM region, including for Maryland customers, and could lead to widespread and extreme conditions in 2027, such as system collapse and blackouts.” The project has been controversial since it was announced. Carroll County lawmakers say it threatens the environment; would increase local energy costs; would result in a loss of farmland and revenue for farmers; would be disruptive; and would have other consequences. One measure proposed by Sen. Chris West would allow electric companies to own and operate their own power-generating facilities. West said building additional power generation capacity in the right places will negate the need to construct additional power transmission lines through rural Maryland. “The people of Maryland aren’t going to benefit one iota from the electricity that’s going to flow through this line,” West said, “if it ends up being built.” Another of West’s proposed bills would change the way eminent domain works in Maryland, banning quick-take authority for any land under a preservation or conservation easement, requiring compensation to reflect land value diminution for land-owners within 150 feet of any land acquired through eminent domain to install a power line, paying for attorney and court-related expenses for any land owner that wins a case challenging their valuation, according to West. “I’ll be co-sponsoring bipartisan bills to restrict usage of eminent domain to take private property for corporate profits,” Sen. Justin Ready said, “and legislation to slow this process down so we can get a full, impartial analysis of Maryland’s energy production and grid needs before any action takes place on MPRP.” West proposed another measure that would have the Maryland Public Service Commission require a grid optimization study to be conducted, “evaluating the potential for increasing the capacity and efficiency of the state’s existing transmission and distribution infrastructure” before a project can be approved, according to West. The study would deduce the potential for increasing capacity by using advanced technologies, optimizing existing transmission lines, reducing load on the grid, and improving energy efficiency to reduce demand. The public and the Office of People’s Counsel would have the opportunity to comment on the study before the commission determines if the applicant is compliant with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s terms. Another of West’s proposed bills would call on the Maryland Public Service Commission and the Maryland Energy Administration to, “establish a plan to gradually phase out Maryland’s natural gas energy generation facilities,” only after Maryland can meet half of its energy needs using renewable sources like wind, solar, hydroelectric, geothermal and nuclear power, according to West. “Our state’s energy crisis will be the next most important issue,” Del. Chris Tomlinson said. “Over the course of many years, Maryland lawmakers have passed policies that make it nearly impossible to create or produce reliable sources of energy. Everything from closing coal power plants to limiting natural gas production to irresponsible ‘climate’ goals that require drastic reduction in production. At the same time, new energy sources such as wind and solar are unable to produce equal amounts of energy. As a result, our state is forced to import energy from states that still generate energy the old-fashioned way [coal, natural gas, etc.].” One bill, also proposed by West, would direct the Maryland Public Service Commission to refrain from approving any new power line projects until May 1, 2026. In that time, a 21-member task force would be assembled to ensure reliable energy access to Marylanders while planning to reduce the amount of energy imported from out-of-state. The proposed task force — composed of a representative from the House of Delegates, one member of the state Senate, the secretary of the Environment, the secretary of Agriculture, the Maryland Energy Administration, the People’s Counsel, the Public Service Commission, PJM, Baltimore Gas & Electric, Constellation Energy Corporation, Potomac Electric Power, Potomac Edison, Delmarva Power & Light, Southern Maryland Electric Cooperative, Maryland’s independent electricity generating companies, the Maryland Farm Bureau, environmental nonprofit organizations, Maryland ratepayers, and one energy expert appointed by the governor — would report to the governor by Dec. 31, 2025. “Among the options that shall be considered by the Task Force shall be the expansion of the state’s nuclear energy generation capability, the expansion of the state’s renewable energy resources, the prioritization of energy storage facilities and the upgrading and enhancement of the state’s existing electricity transmission system,” according to West. “The Data Center Energy Independence Act” is another of West’s proposed bills that would require any data center constructed in Maryland that uses more than 20 megawatts of electrical power per year to build and operate a power-generation facility capable of meeting the entirety of the data center’s energy needs, according to West. “Our energy demand has increased due to AI technology/data centers,” Tomlinson said, “and the electrification of everything from cars to buildings to leaf blowers. As a result, our state is facing an energy crisis of epic proportions. And the direct result of these terrible politics is the Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project that looks to tear Baltimore, Carroll, and Frederick counties in half. The House Republican Caucus, including me personally, will be introducing several bills that look to address this specific transmission line and the overall problem our state faces.”",0,[],2025-01-06 19:18:17,2025-01-06 22:17:11

The park and its sister parks in New York and California allow guests to return at a later date if a significant portion of attractions are forced to close due to inclement weather during their visit. Here are the ticket change policies for America’s most popular theme parks. Typically, Walt Disney World tickets are non-refundable. However, ticket values never expire, and guests may change the dates for wholly unused tickets. They are responsible for any difference in ticket prices. One exception, when refunds are allowed, is if a hurricane directly impacts the Orlando area or guests’ place of residence. Disneyland tickets are non-refundable. Single-day tickets purchased through Disneyland's website or app are valid through Dec. 30, 2026. Mutli-day tickets are valid through Jan. 12, 2027 or 13 days of first use, whichever comes first. Guests are responsible for any difference in prices for new dates. They would also need to make new theme park reservations, which are required at Disneyland, but not Disney World. Universal Orlando tickets are typically non-refundable, though the Florida resort makes exceptions for hurricanes impacting the Orlando area or guests’ place of residence. Guests who need to reschedule their trips may change their ticket dates, paying any difference in ticket prices. Guests Services can also review requests on a case-by-case basis. Universal Studios Hollywood tickets are only valid on the date for which they were purchased, but guests who purchased tickets directly from Universal and need to reschedule may contact the Southern California park for help. Tickets are usually non-refundable, but there are exceptions for natural disasters or state of emergency declarations in the Hollywood/Los Angeles area and guests’ place of residence. The following United Parks & Resorts theme parks have a zero-change fee policy, as long as ticket changes are made 24 hours in advance of the reservation date.

Merchan had denied Trump's bid to dismiss the case in a ruling last week and ordered his sentencing on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to proceed this week, ahead of his inauguration. Trump's filing said he is appealing those decisions to the state Appellate Division later today, and is entitled to an ""automatic stay."" In a statement, Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung called the sentencing ""unlawful."" ""The Supreme Court’s historic decision on Immunity, the state constitution of New York, and other established legal precedent mandate that this meritless hoax be immediately dismissed,"" he said. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office urged the judge to deny the request. They noted a final judgment would allow Trump to move on with his appeals in the case, and also noted that the reason the sentencing is only happening now was at Trump's insistence. The ""current schedule is entirely a function of defendant’s repeated requests to adjourn a sentencing date that was originally set for July 11, 2024; he should not now be heard to complain of harm from delays he caused,"" they wrote. The DA also contended now is ""the least burdensome time"" for Trump to be sentenced. ""As this Court has noted, and defendant has argued, sentencing a sitting President during his term in office raises heightened and potentially insuperable obstacles. Defendant has also vociferously objected to being sentenced after the end of his forthcoming presidential term,"" the prosecutors noted. ""By contrast, sentencing on January 10 raises none of these concerns: defendant has no viable claim of presidential immunity from ordinary criminal process"" and ""is not yet engaged in any official presidential functions that would be disrupted by the sentencing,"" they wrote, adding ""it would be feasible to complete the sentencing proceeding in less than an hour."" In his Friday ruling, Merchan said he did not plan to jail Trump and was likely to sentence him to an unconditional discharge, meaning he would remain a convicted felon but would have no other punishment. Trump was convicted in May of falsifying records related to a hush money payment his then-attorney Michael Cohen paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the closing days of the 2016 presidential election. Daniels testified she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006, a claim he has denied. He was initially scheduled to be sentenced in July, but Merchan postponed the proceeding at Trump's request in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling setting a new standard for presidential immunity earlier that month. In a pair of rulings over the last month, Merchan found that the Supreme Court ruling didn't affect Trump's conviction in the criminal case. The judge's Friday ruling said Trump could appear in person or virtually for the sentencing and asked Trump's attorneys to inform him of the decision by Sunday. It's unclear if they replied or if their filing is the response. The DA's Monday filing said Trump had decided to appear virtually, but did not state the source.

Donald Trump wants to block his Jan. 10 sentencing in the hush money case as he appeals Judge Juan Merchan’s rulings rejecting his attempts to overturn his New York state guilty verdicts for falsifying business records. “Due to the fact that further criminal proceedings are automatically stayed by operation of federal constitutional law, the Court will lack authority to proceed with sentencing, must therefore immediately vacate the sentencing hearing scheduled for January 10, 2025, and suspend all proceedings in the case until the conclusion of President Trump’s appeal on Presidential immunity,” Trump’s lawyers wrote in a filing dated Sunday and made public Monday. On Friday, Merchan rejected Trump’s latest motion to dismiss and set sentencing for Jan. 10, noting that he didn’t intend to sentence Trump to incarceration. The new defense filing is a notice that Trump is appealing recent rulings by Merchan that rejected Trump’s attempt to use presidential immunity to dismiss the case or overturn the guilty verdicts reached by a jury against him last year. Following those May verdicts on all 34 counts charged, the Supreme Court’s July immunity ruling in the federal election interference case led Trump to argue that its reasoning should lead to overturning the state verdicts and dismissing the case. Citing the immunity ruling in this latest filing, Trump’s lawyers wrote that initiating these appeals automatically pauses further proceedings. If they’re correct about that, then Trump will not likely be sentenced before he is inaugurated on Jan. 20. At any rate, the filing itself calls into question whether Trump will be sentenced Friday, but we will see what Merchan does and what further appellate steps Trump's lawyers take if the judge seeks to move forward with the sentencing despite this latest filing.

Nothing says football season like a juicy, classic cheeseburger from your favorite local chain, and while chicken products are one of the biggest fast-food and casual-dining trends as we kick off 2025, the burger still reigns supreme among many US consumers. Restaurant Business reported that limited-service chains where burgers are a core menu item generated $110 billion in total sales in 2023, more than double the sales generated by limited-service chicken chains like Popeyes and Chick-fil-A. In 2024, casual dining chains capitalized on America's need for beef. Chili's and Applebee's introduced value meals that highlighted burgers. Chili's added its Big Smasher, a play on the McDonald's Big Mac, to its ""3 For Me"" value menu, while Applebee's released the ""Really Big Meal Deal,"" which included a chicken sandwich or bacon cheeseburger, bottomless fries, and a drink for $9.99. ""We've always had incredible burgers on our menu, but for about a year now, we've been hearing more and more frustration from fast-food fans over rising costs,"" Chili's director of culinary, Brian Paquette, told Business Insider last spring, adding it's one of the reasons the chain is leaning into burgers and drawing inspiration from fast-food favorites. We ranked classic cheeseburgers from four chain restaurants — Applebee's, Chili's, Buffalo Wild Wings, and TGI Fridays — based on taste and value. Here's how the four chain restaurants' cheeseburgers ranked, from our least to most favorite. My least favorite burger came from TGI Fridays. I ordered the cheeseburger at the restaurant I visited in Massachusetts. It cost $12.49, excluding taxes and fees, and came with a side of french fries. I live in New York City, but I had to travel further afield to try the chain's burger because many of my local TGI Fridays restaurants have closed. In early November, the chain filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and Reuters reported that it was facing $37 million in debt, which led to some underperforming restaurants closing. The TGI Fridays location I visited in Massachusetts is locally franchised and owned, so it's not included in the larger brand's bankruptcy filing. The cheeseburger was topped with two slices of American cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles, and red onion. The burger, like the other burgers I tried in this taste test, was served on a brioche bun. When I lifted the burger to examine the toppings, I noticed that the very soft bun had partially stuck to the melted cheese. This wasn't necessarily a knock on its own, but adding a sauce or butter to the bun could have made it less dry. There's no sauce on the burger, but there's ketchup provided on every table, or you could request mustard or ketchup on it if you desired. However, I tried it completely on its own. The burger was a touch overdone, even though I ordered it medium. I requested my burger to be cooked medium, but it came out closer to well-done and was quite dry. That said, I did enjoy the flavor of the meat, which I found to be peppery and well-seasoned. The sliced tomato tasted fairly fresh, but I found the lettuce limp and forgettable. The burger had a generous serving of pickles and onions, which I enjoyed. However, overall, I found this burger to be lacking in flavor, and a layer of sauce could have gone a long way. The fries were also well-seasoned, and I enjoyed them. Next up was the Oldtimer with cheese from Chili's. At the Massachusetts location I visited, the most classic cheeseburger on Chili's menu cost $13.29, plus tax. Though Chili's is not primarily a burger restaurant, burgers are a major part of the brand's strategy, which appears to be working. ""Over the past two and a half years, we've removed around a quarter of our menu to focus on our core four offerings: burgers, crispers, fajitas, and margaritas, which now represent 47% of our business,"" Kevin Hochman, the president and CEO of Chili's parent company Brinker International Inc., said in October. In the chain's third-quarter earnings report, Chili's reported a 14% increase in same-restaurant sales and a 6.5% increase in traffic last summer compared to the same three-month period in 2023. The Oldtimer Burger was topped with cheddar cheese, pickles, shredded lettuce, sliced tomato, diced red onions, and mustard. The cheddar cheese was perfectly melted, and the burger patty also had a nice char on the outside. The burger was definitely cooked medium and had a nice juiciness to it while remaining slightly crispy on the outside. When I lifted the top bun, I saw a light smear of mustard on top of the cheese. While it wasn't an enormous amount of mustard, it permeated each bite. I thought the mustard could have been dialed back a bit. The mustard was quite sharp, and while I do like mustard, it was a bit too much for me. However, the rest of the burger really impressed me. The char on the smashed patty was perfectly crispy, and the other ingredients were fresh. The red onion brought a nice bite, and the brioche bun held everything together. I also liked the choice of shredded lettuce, which added a crispy freshness. The fries were also solid: warm, crispy, and well-seasoned. Overall, it was a good classic burger, but I've had Chili's burgers I've enjoyed more in the past, like the Big Smasher, which is their take on a McDonald's Big Mac, and the chain's southwestern-inspired Alex's Santa Fe burger. My second favorite burger came from Applebee's. I ordered the burger as part of the chain's ""2 for $2X"" deal, which also allowed me to get an order of boneless wings and a chicken tender basket. However, the burger typically costs $16.99, excluding tax, at the location I visited in Brooklyn, New York. This year, Applebee's teamed up with the NFL as the league's official grill and bar partner, recognizing a strong overlap between their customer base and NFL viewers. ""We know our guests are football fans,"" Applebee's chief marketing officer Joel Yashinsky told Business Insider, adding, ""This season, we've been all in on the NFL."" Data collected by Applebee's in April revealed that 64% of its guests were interested in or very interested in the NFL, and around 34% had watched the NFL in the past year, which helped shape the chain's strategy for the football season, Yashinsky said. The Classic Cheeseburger came with two slices of American cheese, lettuce, tomato, red onion, and pickles on a brioche bun. There was a thick, gooey layer of cheese melted onto the burger. I thought the two slices of cheese did a lot to elevate this burger. The outside of the burger patty was quite dark, which made me concerned it might have been cooked beyond the medium level I requested. However, I found the burger was supremely juicy and cooked even slightly on the side of medium-rare. The burger was slightly less done than the others I tried. I didn't mind one bit. The melted, tangy cheese covered every square inch of this burger, making for a balanced bite. The thickly sliced red onion also added a lot of flavor, and I thought the lettuce and tomato tasted fresh. This burger didn't have any sauce, but it wasn't dry at all thanks to the cheese and buttery bun that seemed to melt in my mouth. Though it was very similar in ingredients to the TGI Fridays burger, it just tasted better, juicier, and fresher. My favorite burger came from Buffalo Wild Wings. I ordered the All-American Cheeseburger at my local Buffalo Wild Wings in Brooklyn, New York. It cost $14.49, excluding tax. Since Buffalo Wild Wings is primarily known for its traditional and boneless wings, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this classic cheeseburger. The burger came with two beef patties, American cheese, shredded lettuce, tomato, pickles, mayonnaise, and mustard. I was impressed that this burger came with two burger patties. Each patty was crispy on the outside and coated in gooey melted cheese. When it arrived at the table, the bun was glistening, and inside was a hearty smear of mustard and mayonnaise. The fries were tasty, thin, and well-salted, but I had to admit I preferred some of the other chains' thicker fries. I thought this burger was a great value, and I scarfed down every delicious bite. The mayonnaise and mustard added a lot of moisture and flavor to this burger, but it truly didn't need it. The beef patties were juicy yet crispy, and the cheese was perfectly melted, adding a tangy, savory flavor to each bite. It felt like a more elevated version of a fast-food cheeseburger, and instantly transported me back to my childhood with its classic, fresh-tasting toppings and indulgent flavor. The addition of the second patty really enhanced the burger. For just under $15, I also thought it was the best value of all the burgers I tried. This burger delivered a winning bite, hitting all the right notes for a satisfying meal. I would definitely go back to try more of the chain's burgers — football season or not.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/lifestyle/im-chef-loves-using-air-170601727.html,I'm a chef who loves using my air fryer. Here are my 8 favorite meals to make in it.,,Lifestyle,INSIDER,6 min read,"As a chef, some of my best meals to make in an air fryer include salmon, steak frites, grilled cheese, and a whole chicken.",Lizzy Briskin,2025-01-06T17:06:01.000Z,"As a chef, I use my air fryer often to make easy, delicious meals. Some of my best air-fryer meals are grilled cheese, chicken Parmesan, and crispy tofu. I also like to air-fry salmon, steak, or a whole chicken for an impressive meal. As a trained chef, I keep my air fryer on the counter at all times and use it for everything from toasting bread to re-crisping leftovers. Air fryers work like tiny, mighty convection ovens, which makes them highly versatile and efficient for many dishes you know and love. If you're considering investing in a new countertop appliance or just looking to expand your repertoire beyond wings, these are some of my favorite things to make in an air fryer. Air-fried halloumi can be the star of a salad. I can't get enough halloumi. Yes, it tastes like salty rubber. To me, though, it's the best, most satisfying rubber — especially when it's crispy on the outside and gooey in the center, fresh from the air fryer. For lunch or a light dinner, I'll slice up a loaf of halloumi, spray it with cooking spray, and air-fry it for five or six minutes until it has some color on the edges. I'll toss the hot cheese on a salad made with anything in my fridge for a fast vegetarian meal. Salmon fillets cook nicely in an air fryer. Cooking salmon in an air fryer is ideal because the fish's higher fat content makes it better insulated and, therefore, harder to overcook than more delicate options like cod or bass. I recommend air-frying individual fillets of similar sizes rather than a larger side of salmon, as these cook faster and more evenly. Top your fillets with anything from fresh lemon wheels to a dry spice rub, then air-fry for seven to nine minutes at 400 degrees Fahrenheit until the fish is flaky and firm in the center. As a bonus, toss a quick-cooking veggie like broccoli, cauliflower, or asparagus into the air-fryer basket alongside the salmon. There are so many ways to dress up a grilled cheese. There's no better lazy dinner than a gooey grilled cheese. Plus, when you make it in an air fryer, you get to skip the flipping and babysitting. Just assemble your sandwich as you like — don't hold back on spreads and add-ins like fig jam, pesto, thinly sliced apples, hot sauce, or asparagus. Add plenty of your favorite melty cheese (my pick is sharp cheddar), and smush everything between bread. The cheese should get nice and gooey, and the bread should turn golden in about 10 minutes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Chicken Parmesan turns out nicely in an air fryer. The key to juicy and tender air-fryer chicken Parmesan is using thinly sliced boneless chicken breasts that have been cut in half horizontally. Dip each piece in flour, beaten eggs, and panko breadcrumbs to coat. (For a lighter version, skip the breading.) Air-fry your chicken for about five minutes per side at 400 degrees Fahrenheit, then add a spoonful of marinara sauce and a few slabs of fresh mozzarella to each piece. Cook for another few minutes until the cheese is melted and bubbly. I like to serve chicken Parmesan with garlic bread, but pasta also works. Prepare all components of your steak frites in an air fryer. If you want the experience of an elegant French bistro without the price tag, your air fryer is your best friend. Using an air fryer is the best way to make fries at home — plus you can take a shortcut and use frozen ones. Start by cooking your steaks to your desired doneness. It can take about six minutes per side at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for a 1-inch New York strip to become medium-rare. While the steaks rest, toss your fries into the basket and cook them at the same temperature for about 10 minutes or until they're golden and crisp. It's easy to make shrimp rice bowls. Shrimp cook quickly with most methods, but the air fryer frees up your hands so you can prepare other elements for a rice bowl. Although you can use any seasonings and toppings, I like to go for a burrito-inspired dish. First, I toss shrimp with taco seasoning or a homemade spice blend of cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, and smoked paprika. Large peeled and deveined shrimp can cook in about five minutes at 400 degrees Fahrenheit. While they cook, I dice tomatoes and avocados, mince fresh cilantro, and slice a lime. Once everything is ready, pile it onto white or brown rice. I like to flavor mine with lime. I make crispy tofu in my air fryer. For a delicious tofu dish that will turn skeptics into fans, use your air fryer. The key is to remove as much moisture from the tofu as possible before cooking it. Slice the tofu into planks, wrap them in a clean dish towel, and press them under something heavy, like a can of tomatoes, for at least 30 minutes. Then cut the planks into cubes and toss them in a light dusting of cornstarch — this really helps the tofu crisp up. Before air-frying, coat them in a sauce. I like teriyaki, either store-bought or made with soy sauce, brown sugar or honey, garlic, ginger, and rice vinegar. You could just as easily use barbecue, Buffalo, or chimichurri sauce. Your tofu should become crispy and golden in about eight minutes in a 400-degree Fahrenheit air fryer. After cooking, you can add more sauce for extra moisture and flavor. It's possible to cook a whole chicken in an air fryer. It's impressive to cook a whole chicken in an air fryer, and I think it's easier than using an oven. Most 6-quart basket-style fryers can hold a 4-pound chicken. After patting your bird dry, rub it with your preferred spice mix, and be sure to use plenty of salt. I like to use garlic, rosemary, and olive oil. You can stuff the cavity with fresh herbs and a halved lemon for extra moisture and flavor as well. Air-fry the bird for half an hour at 350 degrees Fahrenheit, flip, and cook for another 20 to 25 minutes, increasing the temp to 400 degrees for the last 10 if you like a crispy skin. The chicken is ready when it reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees. Let it rest for five to 10 minutes before slicing and serving.

According to a release sent by Spartanburg 911, the department conducted an internal investigation into an incident where a 911 operator intentionally hung up the phone on Landrum resident Lindsey Stech as she attempted to report a random man lurking at her front door. The viral video on TikTok recorded the encounter between Stech and the 911 operator. According to the video, Stech said she received a notification from her doorbell camera that something was at her door. Stech then said she saw a man carrying a flashlight. The man is visible in the video. After she called law enforcement, a Landrum City police officer responded to the home but did not find a man on the property. Minutes later, the same man arrived at Stech's door again. This prompted her to call 911 one more time. During this call, the operator dismissed Stech’s claims of someone being outside and ended the phone call. The officer later returned to Stech’s home and found the man in question. According to reports, the man was attempting to visit another woman.

The operator called the officer back, saying that the officer needed to return to the scene. The operator also followed up with another call to the LPD officer as he spoke with Stech to ensure that he made contact with the man, Spartanburg 911 said. “We acknowledge that this was not communicated to the caller at the time. Instead, the telecommunicator ended the call without informing the caller of the steps being taken on her behalf,” Spartanburg 911 said via the statement. “This lack of communication caused the caller and her family undue stress, and we deeply regret the negative impact this had on them. ""We have also been in communication with the Chief of Police of the municipality involved in this incident. They have assured us that their department is conducting its own independent investigation into the actions of the officer, and we are working collaboratively to address the concerns raised by this incident. ""We want to assure the public that we are taking swift and decisive personnel action with the telecommunicator involved. We remain committed to learning from this incident and taking the necessary steps to prevent similar situations in the future."" In an earlier post, Spartanburg 911 apologized to the caller.

The Red Hill Registry aims to survey the needs and concerns of those affected. The University of Hawaii has opened pre-enrollment for the Red Hill Registry, a community-driven initiative designed to assist people affected by the jet fuel-­contaminated drinking water from the Navy waterline on Oahu. Set to formally launch in mid-2025, the registry aims to connect affected individuals with resources, track health impacts over time and ensure a community-­centered approach to addressing their needs. The project is funded by a five-year, $27.2 million federal grant and is led by the UH Office of Strategic Health Initiatives. “Pre-enrollment is an exciting opportunity to start getting counted as an impacted community member, ” Dr. Rosana “Sanie ” Weldon, director of the Red Hill Registry, said in a statement. The pre-enrollment process involves a brief, five-to 10-minute questionnaire that allows participants to confidentially share their contact information, current location and activities related to the November 2021 jet fuel spill. The survey also asks about exposure timing, setting and concerns that participants would like the registry to address. The data will help shape the registry’s development, ensuring it reflects the diverse experiences of the affected community. Don 't miss out on what 's happening !

People who are 18 or older can complete the survey and provide information on behalf of children under 18. “This survey marks our third major step of community engagement in the last two months, ” said Tara Sutton, director of community engagement at the Red Hill Registry. “Our focus groups and community-wide surveys have already yielded very useful information as we continue to develop the Red Hill Registry.” As part of its community engagement efforts, the Red Hill Registry has held virtual focus groups to gather insights from different segments of the Oahu population. Separate sessions were held for affected community members who were exposed to the contaminated water at their homes, workplaces, schools or child care centers. The sessions provided a platform for those directly affected to share their experiences. In addition, a group for concerned Oahu residents, who were not directly exposed but wanted to discuss the broader impact of the Red Hill water crisis, was also offered. A third set of focus groups targeted professionals who responded to the crisis or provided support, including health care providers, educators, advocates and agency representatives. The virtual discussions are part of a comprehensive effort to ensure the registry accurately reflects the needs and concerns of the entire community. In addition to the focus groups, the Red Hill Registry conducted a communitywide survey to gather feedback from a broader range of participants. The survey specifically targeted affected community members, concerned Oahu residents who were not directly exposed, and professionals who responded to or supported those affected by the crisis. The Red Hill Registry Development Survey was available online until Dec. 16, giving the public an opportunity to share their perspectives and help guide the development of the registry. Formal enrollment for the Red Hill Registry is scheduled for mid-2025, but pre-enrollment offers a critical opportunity for those affected to contribute to its development.

Say’s plan under Resolution 24-287, which he introduced in December, would postpone or terminate the City and County of Honolulu’s federally mandated 2010 consent decree with regard to its wastewater collection system in order to reduce billions of dollars in city spending. But to make any change to that consent decree—meant to prevent untreated sewage from entering Oahu’s marine and shoreline environments—is difficult to accomplish, city officials say. That’s because the legally binding agreement—entered into by the city, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the state Department of Health on Dec. 17, 2010—also mandates extensive improvements, upgrades and preventive maintenance to the city’s waste collection system. The work is currently centered on an estimated $2.5 billion “full secondary treatment ” upgrade to the Sand Island Wastewater Treatment Plant at 1350 Sand Island Parkway. The project, which turns contaminated water into recycled water that can be used for things like landscaping, must be completed by 2035, the city said. Don 't miss out on what 's happening !

This form is protected by reCAPTCHA. A similar $536 million upgrade to the city’s 45-year-old Honouliuli Wastewater Treatment Plant in Ewa Beach was completed in May. Still, Say believed deferring or delaying work at the Sand Island plant could help taxpayers as they face the city’s newly proposed sewer fee hike this year. If approved under Bill 60, the city Department of Environmental Services says the planned sewer fee increases—which amount to a total increase of 115 % across all rate-paying classes over a decade—would take effect July 1. Overall, the city’s proposed sewer rate hikes will start with a 9 % annual adjustment for the first six years, followed by smaller increases of 8 %, 7 %, 6 % and 5 % in the final four years, officials said. Currently, the city says, an average single-family residential sewer bill totals approximately $110.89 a month. By July 1 that bill would rise to $122.05 a month. And by July 2034, the city predicts, the average monthly sewer bill will be $248.53—a 124.1 % increase from the current average sewer bill. Rate hikes for commercial or nonresidential customers mirror the increase to residents, city officials say. The city said these rate increases are necessary to address rising operational costs and fund critical projects within ENV’s $10.1 billion capital improvement program, scheduled from 2025 to 2040. According to Resolution 24-287, “the costs of upgrading the city’s wastewater system are borne by the city’s ratepayers.” “(The ) increases in sewer rates proposed by the city administration would impose a significant economic hardship on the city’s residents, many of whom are already facing such hardship due to the rising costs of housing, goods, and services, among other things, ” the resolution states. “The Council believes that in view of the serious economic hardship on the city’s ratepayers that completion of the projects mandated under the 2010 Consent Decree would entail, the city administration should make efforts to seek relief from the strict and economically burdensome terms of the 2010 Consent Decree, particularly with respect to the requirement to upgrade the Sand Island WWTP to full secondary treatment by 2035, ” the resolution states. Say’s legislation urges the city administration “to initiate discussions with the (EPA and DOH ), and other pertinent parties to terminate or modify the 2010 Consent Decree, particularly with respect to the requirement to upgrade the Sand Island WWTP to full secondary treatment, or at least to extend the compliance deadlines of the 2010 Consent Decree relating to the City and County of Honolulu wastewater system.” During the Council’s Dec. 11 meeting, ENV Director Roger Babcock testified in support of Say’s resolution and said the city “administration will commit to seeking relief … from the consent decree … from the U.S. EPA and the Hawaii Department of Health.” However, he cautioned that the city could “not support the delay in our need for our sewer fee increase that we’ve proposed because this effort may end up not being successful, ” Babcock said. “This effort, if received well initially from the EPA and the Department of Health, will take several additional steps that will take a significant amount of time.” He noted that effort would “need to have federal legislation to modify the Clean Water Act in order for a waiver to be received (and ) to necessitate this project not happening.” “In addition, it would require going back into federal court, reopening the settlement and having that modified, ” Babcock said. “And the parties would have to agree to that ; there’d be all kinds of filings and procedures that would occur.” “In reality, relief from this would probably take on the order of years to happen, ” he said. “Separately, we have a very tight schedule to meet the terms of the consent decree, ” Babcock added. “So therefore, we need to insist that this effort is not tied to our sewer fee increase proposal ; we can’t delay that effort.” “There would be very serious consequences if we do not receive relief and also then did not meet the deadlines, ” he said. “There will be fines. We will not be able to meet our bond coverage that we are committed to for our existing sewer bonds that we have out, and it would also directly impact our sewer bond rating.” Later, Babcock said an attempt in 2021 to postpone a portion of the consent decree proved unsuccessful. Still, Council Chair Tommy Waters believed the city’s request to raise sewer fees in 2025 might not receive approval in a city where the cost of living is already deemed much higher than in other parts of the country. “I’m not sure you’ll get the votes to increase the sewer fee, ” Waters said, alluding to Bill 60’s future. “I’m just not sure, it may fail. So this (resolution ) … might be necessary.” At his final Council meeting, Say said his resolution was basically “to say that the City Council is ready, willing and able to do whatever it can to control the costs of the secondary treatment plant.” “The total cost to the taxpayers of Oahu will be tremendous, ” he added, “on top of other fee increases that are still pending.” Ultimately, the Council adopted Resolution 24-287.",0,[],2025-01-06 19:18:51,2025-01-06 22:16:52

https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/want-healthier-old-age-try-170038404.html,Want to be healthier in old age? Try volunteering,,Health,The Guardian,6 min read,"Older adults who volunteer have reduced risk of mortality, more optimism and feel less depressed and lonely",Hannah Seo,2025-01-06T17:00:38.000Z,"By the time she turned 61, Amy Laskey had gained a lot of time. Previously, she had been working full time in municipal finance, raising a son and helping to take care of an elderly parent. But then her parent passed away, her child grew up, and she retired. In place of those duties Laskey, now a 64-year-old retiree in New York City, started volunteering. She participates in conversation practice for an ESL class, ushers for classical music venues, and writes letters to incarcerated individuals. She also did financial coaching at a social services organization, which eventually turned into a part-time job. When it comes to volunteering, older adults tend to dominate. Those 65 and older are two to three times more likely to volunteer than adults aged 25 to 34, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. As with Laskey, older adults are more likely to have spare time to dedicate to causes unrelated to work or family. But volunteering is not just a way to fill time. A growing body of research shows that volunteering and maintaining a sense of purpose and meaning in life provides older adults with a wide array of benefits to their physical and mental health. The potential for volunteering to bolster so many aspects of health and wellbeing is heartening, experts say, especially given how issues of loneliness and health can often worsen in old age. One of the biggest motivators driving Laskey to volunteer is how the activities put her into contact with people she would never have encountered otherwise. She observed that when working, it’s easy to get stuck moving between work and home and nothing else, and when retired it’s easy to slip into inertia at home. “It takes continual effort, and not necessarily in a bad way, to be out in the world,” she says. AmeriCorps, the federal agency for national service and volunteerism, conducted a two-year survey to see how volunteer programs for seniors affected participants. “Eight-eight per cent of those volunteers felt like they had fewer feelings of being isolated after two years of volunteering,” says Atalaya Sergi, national director of AmeriCorps Seniors. “Eighty-four per cent of the volunteers also reported stable or improving health after they volunteered for about two years.” Related: How do I stay healthy in my 50s? Philip Yates, a 61-year-old retiree in Peterborough, in the Canadian province of Ontario, volunteered to drive elders to medical appointments shortly after he moved to a new neighborhood. These individuals might not be able to drive or afford a car, or might be intimidated by going to appointments alone, he says, “so there’s a huge need”. While these drives are often short and not necessarily a way to socialize, Yates has learned more about his neighborhood and city through these small interactions. Hearing their stories also “keeps me grateful”, Yates says: “That sounds selfish or condescending, but it really does remind me of my good fortune.” Laskey and Yates emphasized enjoying the feeling of usefulness and responsibility volunteering provides. These are two elements that contribute to a sense of purpose, which is one of the most overlooked aspects of wellbeing, says Eric Kim, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia who studies wellbeing in older adults. A sense of purpose is, in turn, a huge contributor to resilience, he says, because “when you have a ‘why’, you’re much more willing and able to endure all kinds of adversity and persist through hard tasks”. In numerous studies of older adults, Kim and his colleagues have found that a higher purpose in life is linked to reduced risks of heart attacks and strokes, better grip strength and faster walking speed. In another study, they found that older adults who volunteer have reduced risk of mortality, more optimism and a lower sense of depression and loneliness. Other research has found that older adults who frequently volunteer are less likely to develop high blood pressure, and a recent study linked volunteering with slower biological ageing. A sense of purpose doesn’t need to come from volunteering or a job to benefit your health, says Kim. Some individuals might find it in taking care of family members or cultivating a garden. “Purpose” doesn’t need to mean one overarching goal in life, he says. If you have a number of smaller ones, “all of these things can add up.” The relationship between purpose and health, especially physical health, is probably a two-way street, says Kim. You might see physical health benefits from volunteering since it often requires getting out of the house and moving. But it’s also true that people in better physical health are more likely to be able to go out and nurture their interests and sense of purpose, he says. If one opportunity is not a good fit, there are plenty more to try Yet if a volunteer position is not a good fit, these benefits aren’t guaranteed. The difficulties some might experience while volunteering are the same as in a job, says Greg Olsen, director of the New York State Office for the Aging, which provides older New Yorkers with a variety of services and volunteer opportunities. Toxic colleagues, a micromanaging supervisor or a lack of suitability could make for a negative experience. The upside is that “there are thousands and hundreds of thousands of not-for-profits that will always accept a volunteer, because they’re all short-staffed,” he says. If one opportunity is not a good fit, there are plenty more to try. Finding that good fit can be tricky, says Laskey: “You just have to try a lot of things.” Think of ways to use your knowledge or expertise, she adds. For her part, Laskey is good with numbers and happy to use those skills to help others. Yates Googles and calls local organizations like animal shelters to ascertain whether there are opportunities he will enjoy. “Look at what really interests you,” he says, otherwise “you’re not going to do it for long”. A good way to start is with your interests or identities, says Kim. Volunteering can center around a hobby, like a sports league, or, around ethnic, religious or LGBTQ+ identities – like through church or other specialized organizations. Sergi also points out that “just about every community has an organization in their town, city, county, that is tasked with volunteerism.” Local libraries can often put you in touch with those organizations, as can groups like the AARP. For anyone still unsure and hesitant to start, Sergi recommends dipping your toe in with a low-commitment opportunity, like assisting at a one-day event. After that, “you can decide if you want something that’s more long term”, she says. Bring a friend or family member along, too, if you need support. Regardless of what you end up doing, your time and effort can make a difference. “Whatever your background is, no matter where you’ve come from or what you’ve come through, no matter your education level, you have something to give that your community needs,” Sergi says.",0,[],2025-01-06 19:18:51,2025-01-06 22:17:53

Dane Diehl, a Butler Republican, speaks during an April debate (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications). State Rep. Dane Diehl says he wants rhinos to be in zoos, not the legislature. The second-term Republican from Butler prefiled a bill designating the rhinoceros as the official state zoo animal. The state is home to two zoos, in Kansas City and St. Louis, that both feature endangered Eastern black rhinos among their exhibits. But he said he also knows the bill plays into the ongoing debate in the GOP about what makes someone a party purist and whether anyone lukewarm on parts of the platform can honestly call themselves a Republican. Critics call them RINOs, for Republican in Name Only. “I’m sure I’ll get a little flack on it,” Diehl said in an interview with The Independent. The General Assembly opens Wednesday and the first thing on the agenda for the House will be the election of a speaker. State Rep. Justin Sparks of Wildwood, a founding member of the Missouri Freedom Caucus, is challenging state Rep. Jonathan Patterson of Lee’s Summit, the nominee of the Republican caucus, for the chamber’s top job. Sparks has accused Patterson of being a RINO. The bill is not a commentary on the speaker’s contest, Diehl said. “Jon Patterson has done his diligence and proven to me that he’s the leader and he’s going to take the House in the right direction the next two years,” he said. If passed, the rhinoceros would join the existing list of 41 official state symbols. There are five other state emblem bills also prefiled in the House for this year’s session. The legislature began designating official emblems and symbols in 1957, recognizing the state flag and seal already in use and making the Eastern Bluebird the official bird, the Hawthorn the official flower, the flowering dogwood the official tree and the Missouri Waltz the official song. New state symbols are proposed by a variety of advocates, but many, like the designation of Big Bluestem as the official state grass in 2007, are initially proposed by schoolchildren learning about state government. The most recent additions to the list of state symbols and emblems, added in 2023, are the Hawken rifle as the state rifle and Piedmont and Wayne County, as the “UFO Capitals of Missouri.” The Hawken rifle was a powerful, long-range gun developed in St. Louis during the early 19th century that became a favorite of fur trappers and traders operating on the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains. Piedmont received national attention in 1973 for a series of unexplained aircraft sightings. The idea is his own, Diehl said. He wasn’t approached by a school group, he said, and he hasn’t contacted zoo officials to determine if they agree on the chosen animal. “Missouri is one of the few states that has two zoos that also have rhinoceros habitat, and with the loss and it being an endangered species, I just felt like there was a real need to bring information and promote that animal,” Diehl said. The bill has received some notice from colleagues, he said, and suggestions for substitute animals. Some have suggested the animal mascots of state universities, he added. “Somebody said we need to make it the kangaroo or Missouri Tiger,” Diehl said. “Just, you know, to make sure that they’re not forgotten.”",0,[],2025-01-06 19:18:51,2025-01-06 22:16:51

Until the Liberals appoint a new leader, Trudeau will stay on as Canada's prime minister. ""I intend to resign as party leader, as prime minister, after the party selects its next leader through a robust nationwide competitive process,"" Trudeau said. ""Last night, I asked the president of the Liberal Party to begin that process. This country deserves a real choice in the next election, and it has become clear to me that if I am having to fight internal battles I cannot be the best option in that election."" In his announcement, Trudeau said that he made a request for Parliament to be prorogued, one that will be granted until March 24. It means MPs won't meet in the House of Commons for any parliamentary activities, as the Liberals remain in power. Both the Conservatives and NDP have signalled that they'll call for a non-confidence vote the first chance they get, which would trigger an election. Party leaders Pierre Poilievre and Jagmeet Singh both called on Canadians to not trust the Liberals any further, despite who they end up choosing as their leader, and that instead it's time to put their faith in a new party. South of the border, U.S.-President-elect Donald Trump also weighed in, as he furthered his agenda of making Canada the ""51st state."" Many Canadians took to social media to thank Trudeau after his nine years of service as prime minister. Over the past month, Trudeau has faced increased scrutiny since former finance minister Chrystia Freeland resigned in December, as she wrote a letter calling out his ""political gimmicks"" in the face of Trump's tariff threats. Calls for Trudeau to resign have grown among MPs of all parties, including the Liberals. The prime minister’s resignation comes at a bad time for the party, with polls showing that they would lose to Poilievre's Conservatives. In his resignation announcement, Trudeau answered questions from reporters, as he warned Canadians about a future in which Polievre and the Conservatives are in charge. The next federal election must take place on or before Oct. 20, 2025. Below, you'll find more reaction and analysis from throughout the day, in what was a historic moment in Canadian politics. With Trudeau announcing that he will step down as leader of the Liberal Party, it starts the process of finding his replacement. As part of the Liberals' constitution, party president Sachit Mehra has called a meeting, which will be held this week in order to begin a ""nationwide democratic process of selecting a new leader of the party."" When it comes to who's eligible to run, there are several criteria that need to met, like being registered Liberals and being allowed to run in a federal election. Their written nominations also must feature 300 signatures from registered Liberals. As of publication, no one has formally announced that they'll be running for the position. However, some popular names have been circulating among political circles, including former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, current Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc, former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney, Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly, former Liberal MP Frank Baylis, and former B.C. premier Christy Clark, according to the CBC. With Parliament prorogued until March 24, it creates a small window in order for the Liberals to find their new leader and appear united. For more on the process of finding a new replacement, read CBC's comprehensive coverage here. In the wake of a ""critical moment,"" Ontario Premier Doug Ford has taken to X to share his belief that the federal government needs to focus on doing whatever it takes to avoid possible U.S. tariffs. The post came just after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced he would be resigning as leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. ""The federal government needs to do everything humanly possible to avoid these tariffs,"" Ford wrote. ""Canada needs to demonstrate stability and strength at this critical moment, and the federal government must urgently explain to Canadians how they will avoid tariffs that could have devastating effects on our economy."" Ford has been vocal about the need for a proper approach in dealing with Trump's tariff threat, considering the impact it would have on Ontario. President-elect Trump continues to make real threats about imposing sweeping tariffs that would devastate Canada’s economy. In two weeks, the president-elect will be sworn in as America’s next president and will have every opportunity to make his threats real.

""Justin Trudeau's Liberals have let down Canadians,"" Singh said in a Monday afternoon press conference. ""They have let you down when it comes to the cost of homes. He's let you down when it comes to the cost of living. And frankly, it's not just Justin Trudeau, it's every Liberal minister, every Liberal MP who looked down their nose at you when people were saying 'We can't make ends meet, we are struggling with the cost of living.'"" ""So it doesn't matter who the next Liberal leader is. They have let you down. They do not deserve another chance. They're more interested in themselves than the struggles of Canadians."" Singh re-iterated the serious threat of Donald Trump's second presidency and his promised tariffs on Canadian goods and how the Liberals are more concerned with securing their jobs. The NDP leader is also warning against the threat of Pierre Poilievre and the Conservatives, who are leading in vote intention polls. ""They want to cut your pensions. They want to cut health care. They want to cut dental care, all to make their rich CEO buddies even richer,"" Singh said. He added: ""Canadians, give us a chance. Give us the honour of leading this country."" Below is my statement on Justin Trudeau’s resignation.  If you oppose callous Conservative cuts. If you oppose the rich getting richer while everyone else falls further behind. Stand with the NDP this time: https://t.co/7rFS9LdsDh pic.twitter.com/hQRB4XvRZu — Jagmeet Singh (@theJagmeetSingh) January 6, 2025 Singh has faced criticism over the past few months. It started in September, when he ended the NDP's supply and confidence agreement with the Liberals. However, he was reluctant to join the Conservatives in their motion for a non-confidence vote. On Dec. 20, just after the closing of Parliament for the winter holiday break, Singh said he would now support a non-confidence motion. With Justin Trudeau's announced resignation, U.S.-President elect Donald Trump took to his Truth Social platform to suggest ""many"" Canadians would ""LOVE being the 51st State."" ""The United States can no longer suffer the massive trade deficits and subsidies that Canada needs to stay afloat. Justin Trudeau knew this, and resigned,"" Trump wrote. Trump said ""no tariffs"" would be imposed if ""Canada merged with the U.S.,"" a threat he's been making ever since being elected in November. A poll from Leger last month found that only 13 per cent of Canadians are warm to the idea of the country becoming the ""51st state."" More leaders in Canada's political landscape reacted to Trudeau's news, including Chrystia Freeland, Pierre Poilievre and Jagmeet Singh. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre says Justin Trudeau's announcement that he will resign does not change the outlook for the Liberal Party of Canada. ""Canadians desperate to turn the page on this dark chapter in our history might be relieved today that Justin Trudeau is finally leaving. But what has really changed?"" Polievere asked. ""Every Liberal MP in power today and every potential Liberal leadership contender fighting for the top job helped Justin Trudeau break the country over the last nine years."" Nothing has changed. Every Liberal MP and Leadership contender supported EVERYTHING Trudeau did for 9 years, and now they want to trick voters by swapping in another Liberal face to keep ripping off Canadians for another 4 years, just like Justin.The only way to fix what… pic.twitter.com/YnNYANTs1y — Pierre Poilievre (@PierrePoilievre) January 6, 2025 Polievere cited the carbon tax, government spending, as well the Liberals' immigration, housing and crime policies. ""Their only objection is that [Trudeau] is no longer popular enough to win an election and keep them in power,"" Poilievre said. ""They want to protect their pensions and paycheques by sweeping their hated leader under the rug months before an election, to trick you and then do it all over again."" Trudeau has faced increased pressure to step down since his former finance minister Chrystia Freeland resigned on Dec. 16 in a letter to the prime minister. Initially, Trudeau had asked Freeland to step down from the post of finance minister for another position in his cabinet. Instead, Freeland decided to leave altogether, citing that she could not do her job while having a lack of ""confidence"" from the PM. Some view Freeland's resignation, and her scathing letter, as the ""catalyst"" to what led to Trudeau's decision on Monday. When asked to comment on his side of what happened, Trudeau said he isn't ""someone who's in the habit of sharing private conversations."" ""Chrystia has been by my side for close to 10 years now,"" Trudeau said. ""She has been an incredible political partner through just about everything we have done as a government and as a party over the past decade I had really hoped that she would agree to continue as my deputy prime minister and take on one of the most important files that not just this government but this country is facing, but she chose otherwise."" On Monday, Trudeau was asked how the Liberals can be in a position to protect Canadian businesses from the threat of Donald Trump's tariffs, as the party looks to appoint a new leader in the next two months. Trudeau's resignation comes just two weeks before U.S.-President-elect Donald Trump gets sworn into office.Since his election win in November 2024, Trump has repeatedly made threats that the U.S. will impose high tariffs on Canadian goods. ""The Cabinet will still be very much focused on doing the job that Canadians elected us to do in 2021, which is fight for their interests, stand up for their well being, and make sure that they are good and that Canadians are protected and strong. ""There will be a leadership process and the rules will unfold over the coming weeks, but I can assure you that the tools and the need to stand up for Canadians, to protect Canadians and their interests and continue to fight for the economy is something that everyone in this government will be singularly focused on."" With all eyes on Justin Trudeau, the prime minister stepped out at his residence, Rideau Cottage in Ottawa, to announce his decision to step down as the Liberal leader. When Parliament resumes March 24, it's expected that calls for a non-confidence vote will continue. If that vote takes place and the government fails, then an election will be triggered. This will put the new Liberal leader front and centre in the race against the Conservatives and Pierre Poilievre, who are favoured to win the election according to polls. Trudeau believes that stepping down gives his party a better chance. ""There is always going to be the challenge of having a leadership race while a Parliament would face confidence votes in the course of delivering supply to the government,"" Trudeau said. ""So this is something that we're going to navigate through. But I truly feel that removing the contention around my own continued leadership is an opportunity to bring the temperature down, have a government that will focus on the complex issues that are coming forward in the coming months, while the party gets to have a full national process that brings in people from right across the country and makes a determination about the best person to carry the progressive, Liberal standard into the next election."" With Trudeau's granted request to prorogue Parliament, it stops MPs from being able to pass a non-confidence vote, which would trigger a federal election. The Conservatives have tabled many motions seeking a non-confidence vote against Trudeau and the Liberals since fall 2024. Following Freeland's resignation, Jagmeet Singh and the NDP said they would join the Conservatives in passing a non-confidence vote. On Monday, Trudeau defended his decision to prorogue Parliament, saying that it's ""time for a reset."" ""Anyone who's been watching politics closely over the past months will know that Parliament has been entirely seized by obstruction and filibustering and a total lack of productivity. ""It's time for the temperature to come down, for the people to have a fresh start in Parliament, to be able to navigate through these complex times, both domestically and internationally. And the reset that we have is actually two parts. One is the prorogation, but the other part is recognizing that removing me from the equation as the leader who will fight the next election for the Liberal Party should also decrease the level of polarization that we're seeing right now in the House and in Canadian politics, and allow people to actually focus on serving Canadians in this House and with their work the way Canadians deserve."" Trudeau “absolutely” believes that there is another Liberal leader who can defeat Pierre Poilievre’s Conservatives in an upcoming federal election. Before giving his answer, the PM took time to remind Canadians of who he believes Poilievre truly is. “Poilievre’s vision for this country is not the right one for Canadians,” Trudeau said. “Stopping the fight against climate change doesn't make sense. Backing off on the values and strength and diversity that Canada has always worked to pull itself together on, is not the right path for the country. Attacking journalists, the CBC institutions, that's not what Canadians need in this moment. ""We need an ambitious, optimistic view of the future, and Pierre Poilievre is not offering that, and I look forward to the fight as progressives across this country stand up for the kind of vision for a better country that Canadians have always carried despite the tremendous pressures around the world to think smaller, to veer towards the far right and to be less ambitious for what we can be and do as a country when the world really needs Canada.” Justin Trudeau has requested that Parliament be prorogued, which Governor General Mary Simon has granted until March 24. ""Parliament has been paralyzed for months after what has been the longest session of a minority Parliament in Canadian history,"" Trudeau said at his press conference on Monday. Justin Trudeau says he will step down as prime minister and leader of the Liberal Party of Canada after a new leader has been selected. He made the statement Monday morning at Rideau Cottage. It remains unclear if Justin Trudeau will stay on as prime minister, even after stepping down as the Liberal leader. He could wait until a new party leader is selected. According to The Globe, the Liberal Party national executive plans to meet next week, likely after Wednesday's national caucus session, where they will make their leadership decision. The Liberals can either appoint an interim leader or hold a shortened leadership contest. In the event that they choose the latter, it wold require the Governor-General Mary Simon to prorogue Parliament, which isn't a guarantee. The prime minister will hold an announcement at 10:45 a.m. ET at Rideau Cottage on Monday morning. CBC and the Toronto Star are reporting that Justin Trudeau will use this opportunity to formally announce his resignation.

These are counterproductive to the mission.” Drama and disorganization were the order of the day in the opening weeks of Trump’s first stint in the White House, so the 67-year-old under-the-radar campaign manager, whom he also has called “Ice Baby,” has come in to steady the ship. Politico reported in November that Wiles is “widely admired, trusted and respected by lawmakers and young staffers alike.” She said focus has already shifted to “rolling back redundant and burdensome regulations, keeping taxes low, cutting government waste through DOGE [the new Department of Government Efficiency], and most importantly, sealing the border and deporting criminals who are in this country illegally.” “Susie is tough, smart, innovative and is universally admired and respected,” Trump wrote in a statement in November, announcing Wiles as his enforcer. “I have no doubt that she will make our country proud.” And as if her words were plucked straight from the MAGA chief’s lips, she bemoaned to Axios the “impeachment attempts and other witch hunts,” during Trump’s first administration. “I have every hope that the 47 administration will not have the same number of attempts to put sand in the gears,” she said. “We are off to a fast start with congressional work, hiring the best people, preliminary discussion with heads of state, fine-tuning his [Trump’s] policy agenda, and planning for the first 100 days.” She said Trump is trying to avoid bumps in the road on the West Wing by picking the best suited professionals for his Cabinet, and his insistence on personally interviewing each leadership candidate. Wiles added that the West Wing staff will be a mixture of new faces and old heads, all prepared to work “punishing hours.” And, perhaps unlike her boss, she gave a glowing appraisal of the ease of transition with President Joe Biden’s team, saying the outgoing president’s chief of staff—Jeff Zients—has been “very helpful.” Wiles’ direct work with Trump began in 2016, when she handled his Florida campaign.

But he also sees right-wing governments as a lucrative source of funds for his businesses.",Malcolm Ferguson,2025-01-06T18:06:01.000Z,"Elon Musk wants to be the Italian government’s sole telecommunications provider. The billionaire’s SpaceX company is closing in on a $1.6 billion security contract after  Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni visited Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate on Saturday. The Italian government promises that Meloni didn’t talk to Musk about the deal while she was there. If enacted, Musk’s SpaceX would supply Italy with encryption services for government and military use. “Ready to provide Italy the most secure and advanced connectivity!” Musk wrote on his X platform. Others within the Italian government aren’t as enthusiastic about the potential deal. “If 1.5 billion euros of Italian money to use the satellites of an American billionaire in our country is the price to pay for his friendship, we do not agree,” said center-left Democratic Party (PD) lead Elly Schlein. Musk’s eagerness to do business with the Italian government is unsurprising considering the right-wing neo-fascist who currently leads it. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni considers Musk a “genius.” Her crusades against immigration, same-sex marriage, reproductive rights, and anything else she considers “woke,” have endeared her to Musk, who has been attaching himself to the European right as of late. This telecommunications deal is just the latest installment in Musk’s attempted Eurozone takeover. The CEO has meddled in German elections, singing the praises of it’s own right-wing party (AfD) as German politicians denounce his involvement. And in the U.K. Musk has been calling for the release of Tommy Robinson, a popular far-right, Islamaphobic activist and founding member of the British National Party. He has also railed about how civil war is “inevitable” there. The world’s richest man is rapidly expanding his sphere of political influence—and raking in foreign cash in the process.

Kennedy Jr., may receive some support, or at least an open mind, from some Senate Democrats. The Hill reports that Senators John Fetterman and Bernie Sanders may consider voting to confirm the former presidential candidate’s appointment to Trump’s cabinet, citing Kennedy’s criticism of food additives, as well as corporate control of the U.S. food industry. “I think Bernie will give him a fair review,” one anonymous source told the publication, and a different pro-Kennedy source said Fetterman is “definitely a swing vote for all of Trump’s nominees.” Last week, Sanders wrote a column for The Guardian in which he criticized the U.S. health care industry and called for reform to the U.S. food industry, saying “Large food corporations should not make record-breaking profits making children addicted to processed foods, which make them overweight and prone to diabetes and other diseases.” These criticisms overlap with parts of Kennedy’s “Make America Healthy Initiative” plan, which includes promises to remove chemical additives from food and reduce federal funding for processed foods. Kennedy has said that Americans have been “mass poisoned by big pharma and big food,” and Trump has pledged to let Kennedy “go wild.” But Kennedy’s longstanding opposition to vaccines and pledge to ban water fluoridation has drawn criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike, and he’ll have a tough time selling those parts of his ideology to the Senate. Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, a doctor, said on Fox News Sunday that Kennedy was “wrong” on vaccines, but still planned to meet with the nominee this week. Kennedy has met with many senators in recent days to bolster his cabinet bid, including Republicans John Barrasso, Shelley Moore Capito, and Marsha Blackburn. But, in addition to concerns about his medical views, Kennedy also faces from the GOP over his support for abortion, which means his confirmation is far from a done deal.",0,[],2025-01-06 19:19:55,2025-01-06 22:18:00

In the past, stars like Jennifer Lopez and Anne Hathaway have worn bold, skin-baring styles. More recently, Miley Cyrus stole the show with an eye-catching outfit covered in cutouts. On the Golden Globes red carpet, just about anything goes. While some stars stick with glamorous gowns and diamond accessories, others take major fashion risks. Backless tops, see-through dresses, and neon outfits have all had their moment in the spotlight. Here's a look at those styles and some of the other boldest pieces ever worn at the prestigious event. Andie MacDowell wore a skin-baring minidress at the 1991 Golden Globes. The loose-fitting piece had thin shoulder straps, silver sparkles from top to bottom, and plunging fabric that dipped just above her backside. It was so bold that MacDowell opted not to wear any dramatic makeup or jewelry — only a touch of red-tinted gloss. Courtney Love brought her rock-and-roll style to the event in 2000. She wore a John Galliano for Dior gown designed to look like it had been shredded. The sleeveless piece had an asymmetrical neckline, tears across its bodice, and a ruched skirt decorated with blue sparkles and a thigh-high slit. The outfit was memorable and one of the most daring ever seen at the event. Love completed it with silver sparkles dusted across her hair. Anne Hathaway showed the daring side of her style in 2003. Dressed by Elie Saab, Hathaway wore a sleeveless gown that was bold in both color and shape. Its hot-pink fabric was infused with spots of green, and the band beneath its neckline was embellished with small beads. The garment also featured a deep, square-shaped neckline and a nearly hip-high slit that revealed her metallic sandals. Jennifer Lopez was the ultimate golden girl at the 2009 event. She walked the red carpet that year in a sparkle-covered gown from Marchesa. Two swaths of fabric covered her chest and created a plunging halter neckline, also making way for a backless bodice. The latter feature emphasized the gown's mid-rise, floor-length skirt. Halle Berry later participated in the sheer style trend of 2018. She did so via a long-sleeved minidress designed by Zuhair Murad. The garment, made entirely from lace, was see-through and featured a deep V-shaped neckline. Its form-fitting bodice was also connected to its short skirt. Berry perfected the outfit with simple sandals, an updo hairstyle, and statement earrings. Kerry Washington skipped a shirt for the 2020 Golden Globe Awards. Instead, she wore only a blazer, crystal body chain, and floor-length skirt from Altuzarra. The outfit was edgy, daring, and perfectly accessorized. Washington wore the three pieces with strappy sandals, silver jewelry, a short bob haircut, and vibrant red lipstick. Long before promoting ""Wicked,"" Cynthia Erivo had a neon-green fashion moment at the 2021 event. She wore a sleeveless, sharply structured Valentino gown. It had a full skirt that hovered above the ground, statement stitching, and pockets on each side of the dress. Erivo wore it with platform heels and cream-colored gloves that extended over the elbow. You couldn't miss Karen Gillan when she attended the event in 2024. She wore a white Iris van Herpen dress with sheer panels and a scale-like pattern. The garment was handmade and looked more like an art piece than a traditional red-carpet gown. She wore the piece with two rings and simple black sandals. Miley Cyrus showed off tons of her tattoos on the 2025 red carpet. Celine designed her showstopping dress, which had an open back that plunged to her hips and crystal-covered shoulder straps. It was also daring across its bodice, where the gown had a deep neckline and thin, sparkling slits. The dress made for an ensemble that was equally daring and chic.

Shifts in work dynamics, including the introduction of AI agents, are reportedly on the horizon. Tariffs under Trump may lead to higher prices and project cuts for businesses, Rimini CFO says. Talks of artificial intelligence dominated 2024, and tech leaders predict that the next stage of the new AI era will come in 2025 — for better or for worse. Their mixed predictions indicate that the outlook for AI in 2025 is still uncertain. Still, many execs assert that the way people interact with technology will continue to change in 2025, and it'll likely impact jobs. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, said in a Sunday blogpost that AI agents could join the workforce this year and ""materially change the output of companies."" Since generative AI became a more mainstream concept, concerns about job security have risen amongst workers. Agentic AI, which requires GenAI to work, is the technology that AI companies say could work alongside their employees as digital coworkers. ""We continue to believe that iteratively putting great tools in the hands of people leads to great, broadly-distributed outcomes,"" Altman wrote. This year will also reveal if the prediction that Bill Gates has been vocal about for over 10 years will come to fruition. Gates has said on many occasions that two-thirds of all jobs in the US will require some form of education beyond high school by 2025. Here's what Amazon's CTO, an ADP exec, and other tech leaders say 2025 has in store. Management services company ADP uses AI to assist sales reps, and GenAI helps the company prepare for investor days, among other things, according to The Wall Street Journal. Such investments will continue in 2025, Don McGuire, CFO at ADP, said to the Journal. ""Things that people used to sit beside you and have a headset, now you can do those things with GenAI tools,"" McGuire said. More intentional tech use is ""reshaping our relationship with the digital world,"" and people are prioritizing wellbeing over attention-seeking, Amazon CTO Werner Vogels said in a December blogpost. ""The workforce of tomorrow will not only be driven by financial success and career progression but by a deeper desire to create positive change in the world,"" according to Vogels. As smarter tech integrates into the workforce, Vogels said ""a quiet revolution"" is happening among workers who value meaningful societal impact over financial success. Millennials and Gen Z are leading the charge in finding their purpose at work, but Vogels said the trend is being driven by other age groups and the job market itself. ""Harnessing technology for good has become both an ethical imperative and a profitable endeavor,"" Vogels said. However, Clement Delangue, CEO of AI startup Hugging Face, predicts a more combative response to AI. He said on LinkedIn that the ""first major public protest related to AI"" is coming in 2025. Tech users will find more intentional ways to use their devices in 2025, according to Vogels. The Amazon exec pointed at data related to social media use and mental health issues among teens in the US in his blog about 2025 as an indicator of a need to rethink our relationship with technology. ""Every swipe, headline, and notification are meticulously engineered to hook us,"" Vogels said. More people are becoming conscientious of their screen time. Some are implementing rules for themselves or their children, and others are seeking out alternatives like ""dumb phones"" with no web browsers. On the other hand, Delangue predicts that other consumers will buy into more futuristic devices, like the robots being developed by Tesla and other robotics companies. ""At least 100,000 personal AI robots will be pre-ordered,"" he said on LinkedIn. Donald Trump is weeks away from his second presidential inauguration, and the president-elect has already threatened tariffs on imported goods. It ""feels like an inevitability,"" according to Michael Perica, CFO of software company Rimini Street. LendingTree economist Jacob Channel previously told Business Insider that consumers will likely be subjected to higher prices for their goods during his term if Trump makes good on his pledge. Companies may have to make some cuts to offset the effects of tariffs, Perica told the Journal. More businesses will have to adapt their strategies in anticipation of supply-chain disruptions. ""We are absolutely partnering with folks to help them along and take a look and evaluate what's a 'nice-to-have' project versus 'got to have,'"" Perica said.

I stand by it.” The former Fox News host-turned-SiriusXM podcaster was raised Catholic and married her first husband in a Catholic ceremony in 2001 before getting divorced five years later. Just this past year, she went through the Catholic annulment process as part of what she described as a “crisis of faith.” In that same post, Kelly went on to spoil the surprise ending of the film to make her point. So if you haven’t seen Conclave and don’t want the ending ruined for you, be warned. “‘Spoiler:’ They make THE POPE INTERSEX!

Here's what they believe helped them live so long.",Serafina Kenny,2025-01-06T17:13:48.000Z,"Tomiko Itooka was the oldest person in the world when she died last month aged 116. Another 116-year-old, Inah Canabarro Lucas of Brazil, now holds the title. Here are the two women's very different longevity secrets. The world's oldest person who died at the age of 116, and her successor, have very different secrets to longevity. Tomiko Itooka, who lived in Ashiya, Japan, died on December 29 at the age of 116 years and 220 days. She was succeeded by Inah Canabarro Lucas, a nun who lives in Porto Alegre, Brazil, who was 116 and 212 days old as of January 6. Lucas is one of only three living people confirmed to have been born before 1910. It's extremely rare to live to 116 — and just 0.03% of the US population is over 100, according to the Pew Research Center's analysis of US Census data. A combination of genetics, lifestyle, and luck, are though to contribute to a person's longevity — but we don't know for sure why some people live so long. Here's what they both credited their longevity to. Itooka married at 20 and was an office manager at her husband's factory during World War 2, according to LongeviQuest, an organization that verifies the ages of supercentenarians. She was very active and enjoyed hiking. She twice climbed Mount Ontake, which is 10,062 feet high, and did a pilgrimage of more than 600 miles to 33 temples in the Kansai region in her 80s. Itooka also drank a popular Japanese fermented drink called Calpis every morning, LongeviQuest reported, and loved bananas — two things she credited her longevity to. There's some evidence that lactic acid bacteria, which are found in Calpis, could be beneficial for longevity, according to a 2024 review published in the journal Aging and Disease. However, the researchers say further investigation is needed. Fermented foods are generally great for gut health because they increase the diversity of microbes in the digestive system, epidemiologist and nutrition expert Tim Spector previously told Business Insider. Hiking could also have contributed to Itooka's longevity. Such activity can offset the life-shortening impacts of being sedentary, a 2016 American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine article found. Lucas was a teacher who became a Catholic nun at the age of 26. She thinks God is the secret to her longevity. ""He is the secret of life. He is the secret of everything,"" she told LongeviQuest last February. Researchers from LongeviQuest previously told BI that religiousness is a common thread among the oldest people in Latin America they have verified. A 2018 study by researchers at Ohio State University on 1,600 obituaries supports this. It found that people whose obituaries mentioned religious activities lived, on average, 10 years longer than those whose obituaries did not. The researchers thought this could be because religion gives people social support and opportunities to volunteer.

He then replied saying “yes” to another person who said: “We could have avoided a lot of disasters by simply telling leftist retards to stfu.” Musk appears to have made a conscious choice to reintroduce the word into right-wing parlance of late, often using it on his X platform. An analysis of his X posts and replies shows that he has used the term or a variant of it 15 times since Dec. 20, having never used it before that. This is despite his Dec. 29 plea for more “positivity” on the platform. “Please post a bit more positive, beautiful or informative content on this platform,” he said. That post came just days after he used his new favorite slur against Americans during a wild meltdown over H-1B visas. In a weird few days for the DOGE co-star, he agreed with a post that used the slur to say Americans could not exclusively fill the U.S. tech workforce and urged detractors to “take a big step back and F--- YOURSELF in the face.” The word is also a favorite of right-wing mouthpiece Laura Loomer, despite her current spat with Musk. She has used it five times since May, most notably against musician Macklemore after he signaled support for Palestine. Musk does sometimes spread fake news on his own platform, most notably in August last year when he shared a fake Telegraph article claiming his new foe British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was considering sending far-right rioters to “emergency detainment camps” in the Falklands, an island off Argentina controlled by the U.K. France 24 described him as a disinformation “super-spreader.” The site reported that in the first three weeks of October alone, the billionaire published at least 28 fake news stories on his X account, which were seen nearly 540 million times.

And not everyone appreciates it. Nearly half (45%) of hiring managers say Gen Z is the most challenging generation to work with, according to a 2024 survey by Resume Genius. In another survey, three in 10 managers told ResumeBuilder.com they try to avoid hiring Gen Z workers, saying they lack traditional workplace etiquette. About 18% of managers have considered quitting because of the stress of managing them, according to a Nov. 5 report from online education magazine Intelligent.com. Their top complaints? About 57% said Gen Zers have trouble making eye contact and dress inappropriately during job interviews, according to the ResumeBuilder.com survey. Almost 20% used inappropriate language during the interview, about 16% had an inappropriate setting during virtual interviews and 13% refused to turn their cameras on during a virtual interview. And about 9% brought a parent to the job interview, according to survey respondents. The first two issues could be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, experts said. Gen Zers were likely in college at the time and had to transition to online classes. They became accustomed to being offscreen and may not directly correlate eye contact with paying attention. ""I do think that Covid had something to do with it because we were already going in a trend where so many were comfortable on a phone or behind a computer,"" said etiquette expert Jules Hirst. Branding agency CEO Sunny Bonnell, who has about 10 Gen Z employees, said the work etiquette issue is overblown, especially when it comes to managers being less willing to tolerate boundary-crossing behavior. ""I think leaders sort of see their Gen Z boldness as a breach of professionalism,"" Bonnell said. She thinks Gen Z feels less obligated to their employer than previous generations, who may have been willing to work late without extra pay, take meetings during vacations and defer to their employers. ""Gen Z was raised with the outlook of work life balance, stability and technology,” Bonnell said. ""They’re watching their parents and grandparents work tirelessly, sometimes at the cost of their well-being. So many of them have decided they don’t want that."" Bonnell recommends Gen Zers do lots of research while job-hunting to make sure there’s a culture and values fit. If you want a company that respects work-life balance, you should find one that already does rather than expect a company to change its existing value structure. See if you can talk to people who have worked there before or are currently employed. Ask your network if they know someone who would be willing to share. If you’re a hiring manager looking to breathe new life into a company, you may need to be prepared to hire someone who doesn’t fit the mold. ""Sometimes Gen Z is here to question, not conform,"" Bonnell said. ""Companies want innovation, but are shocked when it isn't dressed in a suit."" Even though some allowances should be made for youth, Hirst said there are still some basic concepts that Gen Z should understand. First, never be late. She recommends that Gen Z workers always show up a few minutes early to Zoom meetings (you never know when technology will not cooperate and you’ll have to restart your computer). Second, be aware of how much you’re talking about non-work topics. Sure, sometimes coworkers can feel like friends, but that doesn’t mean you can spend an hour gabbing about last night’s date. ""Think about what it is that you’re sharing — is it something that you would want to see on social media?"" Hirst said. ""If you don’t want that to be shared, maybe don’t share that at work."" Third, try to put your phone away during meetings and conversations. Even if you feel like you’re paying attention, you’re sending a message that the other person isn’t worth your undivided attention. Eye contact is important, especially in a meeting with clients or patients. It shows you’re paying attention. ""If it’s uncomfortable to look them in their eyes, look between their eyebrows,"" Hirst said. ""It will look like you’re making eye contact even if you’re not."" These etiquette lessons are important even if you’re working in a traditional field, like law or finance, that are less likely to bend toward younger generations.",0,[],2025-01-06 19:20:54,2025-01-06 22:18:53

It said a Cameron-flagged vessel damaged a cable in the Taiwan Strait. It comes after similar incidents involving cables in the Baltic Sea were also linked to sabotage. Taiwan suspects China of being behind damage to a crucial subsea communications cable just off its northern coast. The damage occurred on Friday near Keelung, according to The Taipei Times, with Taiwanese coast guard officials believing a Cameroon-flagged vessel, the Shunxin 39, was responsible. Despite being Cameroon-flagged, the ship is reportedly owned by a Hong Kong firm. According to reports, the Taiwanese coast guard ordered the vessel to stop so it could be investigated, but because of rough weather conditions officials were unable to board the tanker, which continued on to its destination in South Korea. ""This is another case of a very worrying global trend of sabotage against subsea cables,"" a senior Taiwanese national security official told The Financial Times. Marco Ho Cheng-hui, CEO of Taiwanese civil defense organization Kuma Academy, told The Taipei Times that China was testing the limits of international tolerance through escalating ""grey zone"" attacks, or covert attacks to undermine its security. ""This is not an isolated event,"" he said. As an island, Taiwan is highly vulnerable to subsea cable disruptions, and analysts have warned that it's a weakness China could target as tensions escalate further. The cable damaged Friday was the $500 million Trans-Pacific Express cable linking Taiwan and other parts of East Asia with the US West Coast, according to reports. The cables run for thousands of miles under the sea. Chunghwa Telecom, one of the companies that operates the cable, said that the damage didn't cause major disruptions as it was able to divert data. The incident is the latest possible attack on underwater cables. In the Baltic Sea, there's been a series of mysterious cable severances in recent months, which European officials said could have been caused by Russian sabotage. On Christmas Day, energy and telecoms cables were severed near Finland, with Finnish officials saying a tanker likely used by Russia to evade oil sanctions was responsible. A Chinese vessel, NewNew Polar Bear, was also linked by European officials to damage to subsea cables in the Baltic in November. Analysts told Business Insider last year that China and Russia see undersea cables as potential targets amid growing tensions with the US and its allies. China has long menaced Taiwan, and the US has signaled that it could help Taiwan defend itself if it was attacked.

He famously urged parishioners in 2017 to be disruptors of Trump’s anti-migrant agenda. “We must disrupt those who would seek to send troops into our streets to deport the undocumented, to rip mothers and fathers from their families,” he said. “We must disrupt those who portray refugees as enemies rather than our brothers and sisters in terrible need.” McElroy, 70, will soon have the opportunity to deliver similar directives just steps from the Oval Office. McElroy, a native of San Francisco, spent the last decade in San Diego. Francis’ decision to choose a Trump critic is not coincidental, a church historian from Villanova University told CNN. The pope has opposed Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric over the years, with the most recent instance coming in September when he remarked that he could not endorse Trump or Kamala Harris in good conscience. “Both are against life, be it the one who kicks out migrants, or be it the one who kills babies,″ Francis said at a news conference. “You must choose the lesser evil. Who is the lesser evil? That lady, or that gentleman? I don’t know. Everyone, in conscience, [has to] think and do this.” Francis, an Argentine, made harsher comments against Trump in 2016. That’s when he told reporters the then-presidential candidate was not a real Christian. “A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,” he said. Trump has hit back at Pope Francis. He announced on Dec. 20 that his pick to be the U.S. Ambassador to the Vatican was Brian Burch, an outspoken critic of the pope. Francis had a much cozier relationship with Joe Biden, a devout Catholic who had a relationship with the pope even before he was elected president in 2020. The pope is set to have a farewell meeting with Biden on Friday before he bows out of the White House later this month.",51,[],2025-01-06 19:20:54,2025-01-06 19:20:54

Privately, he seems to be tiring of Musk dropping in whenever he feels like it. “Trump does complain a bit to people about how Musk is around a lot,” New York Times journalist and “Trump whisperer” Maggie Haberman told tech reporter Kara Swisher during the latest episode of Swisher’s podcast, On.",Janna Brancolini,2025-01-06T16:24:04.000Z,"Publicly, Donald Trump is thrilled to have his mega-donor and “First Buddy” Elon Musk camping out just a few hundred feet from his house. Privately, he seems to be tiring of Musk dropping in whenever he feels like it. “Trump does complain a bit to people about how Musk is around a lot,” New York Times journalist and “Trump whisperer” Maggie Haberman told tech reporter Kara Swisher during the latest episode of Swisher’s podcast, On. After pouring more than a quarter-billion dollars into Trump’s re-election effort, Musk has been renting the $2,000-per-night Banyan Cottage at Trump’s private Mar-a-Lago club, the New York Times reported last week. It’s not clear who will ultimately foot the bill for the cottage, which is just a few hundred feet from Trump’s main residence and transition-team headquarters. From Banyan, Musk has been able to attend Trump’s personnel meetings and crash awkward dinners with rival tech billionaires, like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. “He really parked himself in Trump’s face,” Haberman said. For now, Musk seems to be on the winning side of the MAGA civil war that’s pitted Silicon Valley’s regulation-hating tech bros against the original grassroots loyalists who have backed Trump since 2016, she said. But it’s not clear how long that will last. Trump hasn’t even taken office yet, and already Musk has inserted himself in policy battles to the point of Democrats calling him “President Musk.” “It definitely bothers him,” Haberman said of Trump’s reaction to the taunt. “The ‘President Musk’ line was always going to be a way to get him. Trump’s not a wind-up toy, but there certainly are very specific things that can zotz him.” Trump is a “one-ring circus,” according to his long-time friends, and “I’m not sure Musk has figured that out yet,” Haberman added. She predicted that Musk will try to maintain his current level of physical proximity to Trump even after the inauguration on Jan. 20. But it’s likely to be far more difficult once the Trump apparatus moves from Mar-a-Lago to the White House. “I don’t anticipate that Musk is going to have an office in the West Wing,” Haberman said. “I don’t even know that he will have a blue pass to wander around.” The blue badge gives staffers access to the White House and Executive Office Building. Despite his hanging around, Musk isn’t Trump’s most influential adviser, Haberman said. Those would be Trump’s campaign manager turned chief of staff Susie Wiles and his white-nationalist deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. Publicly, Trump’s inner circle all say what a great supporter Musk is, Haberman said. But that doesn’t mean they like having him around. “I think a bunch of people around him are also struggling with how aggressive Musk can be in their interactions,” Haberman said. Musk, she noted, seems more willing to “irritate” Trump than some of his other advisers. The fact that he’s willing and able to fund primary challengers probably buys him more time than usual, but it’s still a fraught relationship. “It’s like watching shifting sands around Trump,” she said. “It’s like this one’s up, this one’s down, but nobody’s ever totally out.”",306,[],2025-01-06 19:20:54,2025-01-06 19:20:54

On Monday Joe Biden announced a buzzer-beater ban on new offshore drilling for oil and gas in 625 million acres of ocean. President-elect Trump wants to undo it immediately. “Drilling off these coasts could cause irreversible damage to places we hold dear and is unnecessary to meet our nation’s energy needs. It is not worth the risks,” the Biden White House said in a statement. “As the climate crisis continues to threaten communities across the country and we are transitioning to a clean energy economy, now is the time to protect these coasts for our children and grandchildren.” This move left Trump and his team predictably incensed, as confirmed by his spokesperson Karoline Leavitt on X. “This is a disgraceful decision designed to exact political revenge on the American people who gave President Trump a mandate to increase drilling and lower gas prices,” Leavitt wrote. “Rest assured, Joe Biden will fail, and we will drill, baby, drill.” But Trump may not be able to overturn this ban at all, at least not immediately. Biden passed this action using the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which grants presidents sweeping privileges to save federal waters from being used for future oil and gas development. The act does not allow a president to overturn said law alone, meaning President-elect Trump would have to turn to an already fractured and tumultuous Congress to allow drilling to begin.",1,[],2025-01-06 19:20:54,2025-01-06 19:20:54
https://www.yahoo.com/news/finance/news/why-disney-willing-pay-help-161329523.html,Why Disney was willing to pay up for Fubo in its quest to launch a new sports streamer,,Business,Business Insider,4 min read,"The future of streaming sports is getting more complicated, Peter Kafka writes.",Peter Kafka,2025-01-06T18:03:05.000Z,"Disney and partners have settled with Fubo to launch the Venu sports streaming service. Venu's launch was delayed over an antitrust suit filed by Fubo. Disney is set to merge Hulu + Live TV with Fubo, creating a major digital TV service. Remember Venu, the sports streaming service co-owned by Disney, Fox, and Warner Bros. Discovery? Unless you spend a lot of time focused on the sports media business, you probably don't. That's because the service never launched: It was supposed to go live in the fall but got derailed by an antitrust suit filed by Fubo, a small streaming service. Now it's again set to launch — after Disney and its partners essentially paid Fubo to drop the suit. Hearings in the case were supposed to start Monday. Part of the payment will be cash, but there's a more eye-popping, and confusing, part of the deal: Disney plans to combine its Hulu + Live TV streaming service — its cablelike package of TV channels — with Fubo's similar service into a new company, which doesn't have a name yet. The combined company should have about 6 million subscribers, making it the second-largest all-digital TV service after YouTube TV, which has some 8 million subscribers. And it would be the sixth-largest pay-TV service, period. (Important note: This deal does not affect Disney's much bigger Hulu subscription on-demand service — the one most people think about when they think of Hulu. That one had 47.4 million subscribers as of September; Hulu + Live TV, which costs much more, has 4.6 million subscribers.) We can get into a few more details in a moment. But to me, the biggest takeaway is this: It's a reminder that Disney, which is launching its own stand-alone ESPN streaming service this fall, isn't fully confident about that service's prospects. That's why it wanted to be in Venu — to be part of a bigger sports streaming service, in case a meaningful number of people wanted streaming sports from ESPN and other networks as well. And now that Venu is (very likely) to launch this year, it means that by next fall, ESPN watchers will have a lot of options: They can pay for stand-alone ESPN; they can pay for it as part of a sports-streaming package along with other channels like ABC, TNT, and Fox; or they can pay for it as part of a very big bundle of channels, delivered by a variety of traditional and digital pay-TV companies. Onto the details: The new, unnamed Disney/Fubo joint venture would be 70% owned by Disney, which would also control its board. But Fubo's existing management team would run the service. The deal also allows Fubo to create a new ""skinny"" bundle of networks including ESPN and ABC. And people who are already paying for Fubo or Hulu + Live TV via existing apps would be able to keep doing that. Fubo also gets cash as part of the deal. Disney, Fox, and WBD plan to collectively pay the company $220 million, and next year Disney is set to lend the company $145 million to help pay down Fubo's other debt obligations. Fubo will get a $130 million fee if the deal doesn't get regulatory approval. Fubo shareholders like the deal, pushing the stock up some 172% Monday to about $4. (Fubo had a brief pandemic-fueled run in 2021 when its shares zoomed up to $49, but since then, the market has mostly ignored it.) So, when will Venu launch? No one is saying, but my hunch is this spring. Remember that Venu was originally supposed to launch in the fall, when college and pro football kicked off. But Disney is already planning on launching ""Flagship"" — its ESPN-only service — this fall for the same football-related reasons, and it wouldn't make a lot of sense to launch both services at the same time. So I would expect Venu to go up much earlier once the joint venture, which has been mostly mothballed for months, is ready for prime time. Some big sports dates coming up to keep in mind: The Super Bowl is February 9; college basketball's big tournament kicks off in mid-March.

Davis,2025-01-06T16:13:18.000Z,"British Prime Minister Keir Starmer did not name Elon Musk directly, but it was clear who he was condemning when he told reporters that people were ""spreading lies and misinformation"" about child abuse in his country, falsely accusing the U.K. leader of failing to prosecute foreign-born predators. ""We have seen this playbook many times — whipping up of intimidation and of threats of violence, hoping that the media will amplify it,"" Starmer said at a press conference Monday, the BBC reported. ""Those who are spreading lies and misinformation as far and as wide as possible are not interested in victims, they're interested in themselves."" Starmer, who last year led his center-left Labour Party to victory after 14 years of Conservative rule, was addressing bogus claims spread by Musk and others that he did not take action to address the threat of so-called ""grooming gangs"" that targeted children for sexual exploitation. Prior to leading the Labour Party, Starmer served as director of the Crown Prosecution Service from 2008 to 2013 and was the first to bring a case against one such gang, The New York Times reported. ""When I left office, we had the highest number of child sexual abuse cases being prosecuted on record,"" Starmer said Monday. ""The victims here suffered terrible abuse and then they weren't listened to."" Musk, who spread the false claims on his social media platform, X, has for months targeted the current British government with far-right disinformation. In the summer of 2024, Musk asserted that ""civil war is inevitable"" in Britain after right-wing extremists attacked immigrants across the country, incited by a false claim — spread on X — that a child murderer had been an asylum-seeker (the alleged murdered was in fact a native-born British citizen). More recently, Musk has called for the freeing of the fascist anti-immigrant activist Tommy Robinson and, over the weekend, asked his followers if they believe the U.S. government should forcibly ""liberate"" Britain. Starmer, speaking Monday, accused Musk and others of ""trying to get some vicarious thrill from street violence that people like Tommy Robinson support,"" per the Associated Press. Musk's support for the British far right comes after he dropped more than $250 million to elect Donald Trump and follows his public endorsement of Alternative for Germany, an extremist party that critics say is led by Nazi sympathizers.",0,[],2025-01-06 19:21:50,2025-01-06 22:19:08

The plan is still moving forward, but the tariffs may target ""critical imports,"" the Post reported, citing three people familiar with the matter. Trump's team is discussing tariffs on industrial metals like steel, iron, aluminum and copper, medical supplies and energy production, per the Post. Trump denied the report. “The story in the Washington Post, quoting so-called anonymous sources, which don’t exist, incorrectly states that my tariff policy will be pared back. That is wrong,” he wrote in a post on Truth Social. The revised plan would represent a significant shift from Trump's campaign pledge to enact tariffs on everything coming into the U.S. He had vowed to impose 25% tariffs on goods coming from Mexico and Canada and an additional 10% tariff on imports from China unless the countries stemmed the flow of migrants and drugs into the U.S. But tariffs could be politically unpopular in the U.S., where economists have warned they would cause a spike in consumer prices and inflation. Trump has said he ""can't guarantee"" the tariffs won't raise prices for Americans, who cited the economy as their top issue in the Nov. 5 election. His scaled-back plan is still ""strikingly aggressive,"" the Post reported. Trump has said the tariffs are needed to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. Some countries have pushed back. In December, the Canadian province of Ontario threatened to restrict electricity exports to the U.S. Canada retaliated against Trump's tariffs in his first term by putting billions of new duties against the U.S. Mexican Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard said in November that a 25% tariff would hit the automotive sector and raise vehicle prices for consumers by thousands of dollars.

On Sunday, Jacqueline Sweet, a journalist writing for The Spectator, had her X account suspended after she posted an article claiming that Musk wasn’t using a burner account under the name “Adrian Dittman,” after she traced it to a German Musk fan in Fiji. Responding to her post, Musk replied “I am Adrian Dittmann. It’s time the world knew,” before suspending her account for 30 days. The Dittman account has frequently responded to Musk’s posts and supported his political positions, and in videos and audio recordings, seemed to sound remarkably similar to Musk, complete with the tech mogul’s accent and unorthodox speaking cadence. Sweet’s article has also been flagged on X, with users seeing a warning that the link “may be unsafe” if they click on it. Musk supporters have defended the move by claiming Sweet’s article included Dittman’s personal information—even though it contained no private identifying information whatsoever like his address or phone number—while critics have pointed out the irony of the self-proclaimed “free speech champion” Musk censoring an article that he doesn’t like, pointing out how the tech CEO complained about Twitter censoring stories on Hunter Biden’s laptop. The episode is only more bizarre because it’s not clear why Musk wants to bury this largely anodyne news story. This is the latest absurd chapter in Musk’s ownership of the social media platform. It is, by recent standards, which include arguing with his far-right ex-supporters over immigration policy and subsequently penalizing their X accounts after they began to attack him, less destructive but it nevertheless underscores the dangers of having one very rich, deranged person in charge of content moderation on a social media platform used by millions.",44,[],2025-01-06 19:21:50,2025-01-06 19:21:50

Justin Trudeau on Monday announced that he would step down as prime minister of Canada once his party chooses a new leader. ""This country deserves a real choice in the next election, and it has become clear to me that if I'm having to fight internal battles, I cannot be the best option in that election,"" Trudeau said at a press conference in Ottawa. The Canadian leader said that he would step down as Canada's Liberal Party, and that he would cease to be prime minister once his party selects a new leader ""through a robust, nationwide, competitive process."" Trudeau, 53, has been Canada's prime minister since 2015. His nine-year-long tenure as premier is coming to an abrupt end following weeks of turmoil within Trudeau's own party, the Liberal Party. He faced repeated calls from party colleagues to step down after the Liberal Party lost three by-elections last year. In December, Trudeau's deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland, announced her sudden resignation from his cabinet. Freeland, who was also the finance minister, said Trudeau had offered her another cabinet position, but she decided to step down because it was ""the only honest and viable path for me."" She had clashed with Trudeau over his push for increased spending and how Canada should handle the incoming Trump administration. In November, President-elect Donald Trump said he planned to impose a 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico. Since then, Trump has continued to taunt Trudeau by referring to him as Canada's ""governor"" and has joked about making Canada the 51st US state. ""The Great State of Canada is stunned as the Finance Minister resigns, or was fired, from her position by Governor Justin Trudeau,"" Trump said of Freeland's resignation in a Truth Social post last month. Shortly after Freeland's resignation, opposition politician and New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh said his party would bring a vote of no confidence against Trudeau when parliament sat again in January. Singh's party entered into a confidence-and-supply agreement with Trudeau's minority government in March 2022, but withdrew from it in September.

The wrongful death lawsuit filed in Davidson County says Jillian Ludwig, 18, ""was killed in a shooting that was made possible by the multiple combined acts of negligence and recklessness committed by the Defendants here in Davidson County, Tennessee."" The defendants include the city of Nashville, the state of Tennessee, the Nashville Metro Development and Housing Agency (MDHA), Belmont University, state or city employees who examined shooting suspect Shaquille Latrelle Taylor's mental health, a gun supplier that sold a firearm to Taylor and others. Ludwig ""was considered by many music professionals to be a budding star"" at the time of her death, the lawsuit states. She played six instruments, was a member of three bands and performed at well-known venues in Nashville. New Jersey Parents Of Tennessee College Student Killed By Stray Bullet Says Laws ‘Protect’ Repeat Criminals ""Jillian loved her family and friends, and she was a radiant and talented young woman with a bright future ahead of her,"" the suit says. Read On The Fox News App The lawsuit goes on to detail a series of alleged failures that led Taylor, who had previously been deemed incompetent to stand trial in a separate criminal case prior to Ludwig's death, to illegally possess a firearm that he discharged in the area where the 18-year-old was running on Nov. 7, 2023. Tennessee College Student, 18, Killed In Nashville Park By Shooter With Prior Arrests: Cops That day, Ludwig was jogging on a track in Edgehill Community Memorial Gardens Park, just northeast of Belmont's campus, between classes around 2:20 p.m., when she was struck by gunfire that was allegedly intended for another target, the Nashville Police Department said at the time. Nashville police arrested repeat offender Taylor, 29, in connection with the shooting that left Ludwig initially hospitalized in critical condition before she was pronounced dead on Nov. 8. In March, a grand jury indicted Taylor, who had an extensive criminal history, on multiple counts, including first-degree murder, felony weapons possession with criminal intent, five counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and reckless endangerment. Retired Officer Says Us ‘A Different Country’ From 5 Years Ago After Spree Of Violent Attacks On Women The suspect had previously been accused of shooting a Nashville teenager in the chest and shooting a pregnant Nashville woman while she was with her two children. Her injuries led to the miscarriage of her unborn child, the complaint notes. Taylor ""recklessly discharged a .40-caliber firearm"" in the Edgehill Community Memorial Gardens Park area while Ludwig was running, striking the 18-year-old musician in the head. Watch: Video Shows Driver Striking Nashville Police Car During Traffic Stop ""Jillian lay bleeding at this location…in plain view, in broad daylight, for over an hour before she was found by police and provided medical attention,"" the complaint states. Ludwig's father, Matthew Ludwig, previously told Fox News Digital that the shooting ""was entirely preventable."" ""And the laws in place failed,"" he said in November 2023. The lawsuit argues that Belmont University knew or should have known to alert students that the area where Ludwig had been running was unsafe, as they had issued ""other security warnings … to students in other less dangerous areas."" Belmont University said there is little the school can say regarding the pending litigation, but the university did say in a statement that its ""entire campus shares in the continued grief of Jillian’s death,"" and the community has been and remains ""deeply committed to the safety"" of its students. The complaint also alleges the Nashville MDHA, which owned the apartment complex where Taylor, a felon, allegedly fired his illegally possessed weapon, had a duty to ""ensure that Taylor was not using a handgun"" on its property, shooting into the park where Ludwig was running. The metro housing agency said it could not comment on pending litigation, and the Nashville Department of Law, which handles legal requests relating to the Nashville government, said it will have no comment on this case until the case is resolved. The lawsuit further names Jenny Matthai, Dr. Michael Loftin and Dr. Mary Jane Wood, with the Tennessee government, as defendants, alleging the three medical experts had ""conflicting evaluations"" that determined Taylor was too incompetent to stand trial yet not so incompetent that he qualified to be held in involuntary confinement for past crimes prior to the shooting that killed Ludwig. Taylor, therefore, was allowed ""to go free from both criminal prosecution and involuntary confinement causing substantial risk of physical harm to Jillian,"" the complaint says. Bystander Says Suburban Jogger Murder Suspect Smiled At Her Moments After Slaying ""Said Defendants further knew while Taylor was in their custody and control that he had a specific history of violence and gun violence. Further, said Defendants knew or should have known in the exercise of sound professional judgment that Taylor would likely harm others if released,"" the lawsuit says of Matthai, Loftin and Wood. The Tennessee Department of Disability and Aging did not respond to an inquiry from Fox News Digital. Nashville Mayor Freddie O'Connell said his ""heart still aches for Jillian Ludwig, her family, and the entire Belmont community"" in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""Last year, we collectively grieved such senseless gun violence. I remain inspired by the incredible strength of the Belmont community as they collectively grieved Jillian's passing, and I hope that the Ludwig family feels our support,"" O'Connell said. ""We continue to look for effective solutions to reduce gun violence in our community."" The Ludwigs' attorneys were not commenting on the case at the time of publication out of respect for the family. Matthew Ludwig previously told Fox News Digital in 2023 that until laws change, ""this could happen to anyone."" And in April 2023, the Ludwig family was successful in doing just that with the passage of Jillian's law, which requires dependents who are deemed incompetent to stand trial to be housed in the appropriate mental health facility. The law also requires dependents who are determined to be incompetent to stand trial to be entered into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System so that they cannot purchase firearms.

Trump’s aides have been quietly prepping a plan to target only critical imports, rather than all imports from a country, three people familiar with discussions anonymously told the Post. The tariffs would be levied on imports considered to be critical to national or economic security, the people said. While it was not immediately clear which imports those would be, the tariffs are intended to strengthen certain U.S. industries, including materials for the military supply industrial chain, medical supplies, and energy production, two of the three people said. Trump had previously stated his intention to place a 25 percent tariff on all imports from Canada and Mexico, in addition to a 10 percent tariff on all imports from China—a plan that experts say would be disastrous for the U.S. economy, raising costs for consumers, ravaging the stock market, and severely damaging the America’s global economic standing. Sector-based tariffs might be a “little bit easier for everybody to stomach out of the gate,” one of the people told the Post. “The thought is if you’re going to do universal tariffs, why not at least start with these targeted measures? And it would still give CEOs a massive incentive to start making their products here.” It seems that some people inside the forthcoming Trump administration are hoping to avert some of the fallout of his outlandish, dangerous economic plan. In sharing this information, it seems insiders are hoping to float a more moderate approach to tariffs, despite what the president-elect may think. But Trump doesn’t seem to be ready to back down. Trump immediately contradicted the reporting in a post on Truth Social. “The story in the Washington Post, quoting so-called anonymous sources, which don’t exist, incorrectly states that my tariff policy will be pared back. That is wrong,” Trump wrote. “The Washington Post knows it’s wrong. It’s just another example of Fake News.”",1,[],2025-01-06 19:21:50,2025-01-06 19:21:50

Jordan Alexander Sweetman, 19, of Arlington, is charged with obstruction of justice, possession of burglary tools, wearing a mask to conceal identity, driving without a license, and manufacturing and possessing explosive materials. Warren County officials responded to a 911 call on Jan. 1 reporting a man wearing a ski mask throwing items out of a suspicious dark Honda with no license plates, according to a press release from the Warren County Sheriff's Office. Deputies later located a car matching the description of the 911 caller at a 7-Eleven in Linden, about 70 miles outside Washington, D.C., where they detained Sweetman, who tried to flee the scene on foot.

Fbi Found 150 Bombs At Virginia Home In December, Prosecutors Say On Jan. 2, officials conducted a search warrant of the stolen vehicle and found several items resembling homemade explosives. The sheriff's office then called in additional resources, including the local fire department, the bomb squad and Washington Field Office for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Bomb technicians safely removed the explosive devices from the vehicle and conducted a controlled detonation, the sheriff's office said. Sweetman is being held without bond at RSW Regional Jail in Warren County. The 19-year-old's LinkedIn page states that he worked at Joint Base Andrews Civil Air Patrol Composite Squadron, located in Maryland. Fox News Digital has reached out for a statement. 1 Dead After Cybertruck Explodes Outside Las Vegas Trump Hotel Two other unrelated incidents involving explosive devices occurred on New Year's Day. In the early morning hours of Jan. 1, Shamsud-Din Jabbar rammed a truck through a crowd on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, killing 14 people. Prior to the attack, Jabbar planted explosive devices in coolers in two locations in the French Quarter, but police killed the attacker in a shootout before he could detonate them.

Trudeau, 53, had faced calls for months from within his caucus to step down, with opinion polls consistently showing the opposition Conservative Party holding a commanding 20-point lead in advance of a federal election that must be called on or before Oct. 20. Last month, Trudeau’s government was blindsided by the resignation of Chrystia Freeland, then Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister, who accused Trudeau of being ill-prepared to face the threat of President-elect Donald Trump’s saber rattling about tariffs in a scathing open letter. “This country deserves a real choice in the next election and it has become clear to me that if I am having to fight internal battles I cannot be the best option in that election,” Trudeau said. Since being re-elected in November, Trump has needled Trudeau on social media and, reportedly, to his face about making Canada the 51st state, going so far as to call the prime minister “Governor” in several social media posts. Canadian officials, including Trudeau, have made multiple trips to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida to try and assuage the concerns of the president-elect’s transition team, which mainly center around border security and drug trafficking. Meanwhile, as he’s faced the chaotic return of Trump, Trudeau’s stability at home has rapidly eroded. Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the competing center-left New Democratic Party that Trudeau’s Liberals relied on for support in the House of Commons under a previous agreement, said last month that he will vote to bring down the government. A majority of his own caucus had also reportedly told him they believed it was time for him to quit, having lost faith in his ability to lead them into a vote. Trudeau’s popularity has slid, like many incumbents around the world, amid a backlash among voters to inflation, which has exacerbated existing economic hardships. Canada has also suffered from a protracted housing affordability crisis that is one of the worst among Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development states. Trudeau, who was first elected as a member of parliament in 2008, took over as Liberal leader in 2013, when the once-dominant party was in dire straits, having fallen behind the left-wing New Democratic Party to third place in the House of Commons. He won a shock upset victory in the 2015 federal election, leapfrogging the NDP and unseating former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper to win a majority government. In Trudeau’s first term, he passed a major overhaul of child benefits that massively reduced child poverty rates—though recent data shows numbers ticking up again. His government legalized medical assistance in dying, recreational marijuana, and introduced a federal tax on carbon emissions. Trudeau was also embroiled in a series of scandals, including the resignation of Jody Wilson-Raybould, his then justice minister, in 2019, who alleged he tried to intervene in a criminal corruption case against Québec construction firm SNC-Lavalin, which was said to have bribed Libyan officials in the Gadhafi government. A second minister, Jane Philpott, resigned over Trudeau’s handling of the affair. The carbon tax and housing affordability have been key points of attack for Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, the sloganeering opposition leader who is likely to be elected Prime Minister if current polling levels sustain. A former schoolteacher, Trudeau is the eldest son of the late former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. Like his son, the elder Trudeau stepped down under pressure from his caucus, trailing badly in the polls to a conservative opposition, in his making the decision during a famous “walk in the snow.” Contenders for Trudeau’s Liberal crown are rumored to include Freeland, Finance Minister Dominic Leblanc, Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly, former Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney, and Innovation Minister François-Philippe Champagne.",4,[],2025-01-06 19:21:50,2025-01-06 19:21:50

""The DPRK is already receiving Russian military equipment and training. Now, we have reason to believe that Moscow intends to share advanced space and satellite technology with Pyongyang,"" Blinken said while in Seoul, using North Korea’s official name. Such technology would allow North Korea to identify targets and aim strikes at adversaries across the world, including the U.S. As of last year, North Korea was estimated to have an arsenal of 50 nuclear weapons. The warning comes as North Korea fired a ballistic missile into the Sea of Japan, expanding its weapons tests in the weeks before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. North Korea Carries Out First Missile Launch Test Since Trump's Election In one of his last moves as head of the State Department, Blinken was visiting Seoul for talks with South Korean allies about the North Korean nuclear threat. He'll also visit with officials in Japan, France, Italy and the Holy See.

Russia ""may be close"" to accepting North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, reversing decades of commitment to denuclearizing the DPRK. South Korea Imposes A Travel Ban On President Yoon Over Martial Law Declaration Russia helped North Korea launch its first successful satellite in 2023. A Russian rocket launched Iranian satellites into orbit in November, ratcheting up the 21st century space race between the U.S. and its foes. Last year, Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, chair of the House Intelligence Committee, issued an ominous warning calling on the Biden administration to declassify information that was later revealed to be about Russia's anti-satellite capabilities. In May, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy John Plumb warned that Russia was developing an ""indiscriminate"" nuclear weapon designed for space, highlighting its potential impacts on communications, commerce and national security. In a year-end political conference, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to implement his ""toughest"" anti-U.S. policy and condemned the Biden administration for strengthening ties with South Korea and Japan, describing the alliance as a ""nuclear military bloc for aggression."" During his administration, President-elect Trump met with Kim three times for talks about nuclear programs. However, emboldened by Russian support and a lessened enforcement of international sanctions, Kim may be less likely to stand down in talks with the U.S. than ever before. It is also unclear if Trump would put the same emphasis on bolstering U.S. alliances in Asia that the Biden administration did. In the past, he has complained about the cost of keeping 28,000 U.S. troops in South Korea to deter threats from the north and pushed for Seoul to increase its own defense contributions.

Wind gusts between 50 to 80 mph are possible for parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties with the chance for isolated 80 to 100 mph gusts in the mountain and foothill areas, according to the National Weather Service. “Widespread damaging winds and low humidities will likely cause fire starts to rapidly grow in size with extreme fire behavior,” the Weather Service stated. Caution was urged when using any potential ignition sources. The Weather Service also warned motorists to be on the lookout for downed trees and residents to be prepared for possible power outages. The warnings come about a month after the Franklin Fire erupted in Malibu amid similar conditions. The wildfire spread quickly before scorching more than 4,000 acres and destroying several homes.

Here are the conferences, parties, and places favored by the wealthy.",Madeline Berg,2025-01-06T15:31:45.000Z,"Between yacht shows and business conferences, a billionaire's calendar can fill up quite quickly. Each year the uberwealthy flock to the same events and destinations. Here's where you can find a billionaire — and how much it will cost you to join in on the fun. There are about 3,320 billionaires in the world. That's about 0.00004% of the global population. Despite their scarcity, billionaires are surprisingly easy to find. After all, birds of a feather — especially those of a small brood — flock their private jets together. At the start of the year, they descend en masse on Davos. In July, they fly to Sun Valley for the Allen & Company Conference. And they wrap it up with New Year's Eve in St. Barts. Here's where the wealthiest among us mingle, wheel and deal, and relax, and how you can join them — for a small price, of course. undefinedundefinedundefined February: Super Bowl NFL teams are among the most popular toys of the ultrarich: Walmart's Rob Walton has the Broncos, hedge fund manager David Tepper owns the Panthers, real estate tycoon Stanley Kroenke boasts the Rams, Clark Hunt and his siblings control the Chiefs, and so on. Every year, these billionaire owners — as well as billionaire fans — flock to the sport's biggest game every year, though Super Bowl weekend as a billionaire involves more than just wings and commercials. Host committees and travel agencies have curated luxury experiences for the richest football fans. These experiences cost six figures and include chartered jets, five-star accommodations, and access to the field after the game. Suites at this year's game in New Orleans are going for up to $1.8 million on rental platform Suite Luxury Group. The second hottest ticket, after the game, is the private parties, known for their superstar performers. Last year's Roc Nation party counted billionaires Jay-Z and Jack Dorsey among its attendees, while at the annual Fanatics bash, Michael Rubin mingled with Travis Scott and Robert Kraft posed with Tom Brady. ""The Super Bowl is always a draw. It's an excuse to see the best of the best in terms of sports, parties, and entertainment,"" Elisabeth Brown, client manager at travel and lifestyle concierge company Knightsbridge Circle, told Business Insider ahead of last year's game. March: BNP Paribas Open The BNP Paribas Open, which takes place in early March, is one of many tennis tournaments favored by billionaires. Larry Ellison, the cofounder of Oracle and one of the world's richest people, owns the tournament, and Indian Wells local Bill Gates is a regular attendee. In 2024, billionaire scions Emma Navarro and Jessica Pegula played in the tournament. April: The Masters Tournament Forget Easter. The first signs of spring mean one thing for billionaires: golf. Each year, the Masters Tournament kicks off the run of major professional golf championships at Augusta National. The famously exclusive club in Georgia — it didn't allow women to join until 2012 — counts a number of billionaires as members. Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, as well as Warren Stephens, David Ziff, and Stanley Druckenmiller, belong to the club, Bloomberg reported in 2015. Each year, hundreds of private aircraft land at the airports around Augusta. In past years, billionaires like former Nike CEO Phil Knight, hotelier Robert Rowling, and investor Herbert Allen Jr. have had their planes touch. So has Tiger Woods — the only billionaire winner of The Masters. His victory means he is the proud owner of one of Augusta National's iconic green jackets, which are only allotted to members and Masters winners. The secretive club hasn't ever spelled out its membership process, but it's invite-only, and new members can only join when existing ones leave. The general public can, though, spectate alongside some of the biggest names in business. Tickets for the Masters are available through a lottery system — or for as much as $10,000 on the secondary market. May: The Cannes Film Festival Summer starts early for billionaires, who dock their yachts for the Cannes Film Festival at the end of May. While the event is technically reserved for entertainment industry professionals, according to its website, the superrich can pay to play. For them, the fête is as much an opportunity to get a first look at Oscar winners as it is to mingle with stars on the Croisette. The festival was one of the first stops on Jeff Bezos' 2023 grand debut tour of his $500 million superyacht Koru, which he disembarked to hit up the Vanity Fair party at the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc, a favorite venue of the very wealthy and those who court them. In years past, the likes of David Geffen and Len Blavatnik have turned up at the same event. The richest in entertainment, like billionaires Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, have appeared at the festival, while those from other industries, like François-Henri Pinault and the late Paul Allen, hosted their own parties at the film festival. The former throws the Kering Women in Motion Dinner each year, while the latter was known for his themed yacht parties. June: The Royal Ascot While a number of billionaires spend June in the Hamptons or on yachts crisscrossing the Mediterranean, some prefer to spend it on dryer land. The headline billionaires at the Royal Ascot, an annual horse race held about 25 miles outside London, are the members of the British royal family. But many others — and their hats —are in attendance. The rich crowd is different from the one at a typical F1 Grand Prix, and some billionaire horse owners — like Chanel's Alain and Gerard Wertheimer; the shipping scions of the Niarchos family; Tetra Pak heiress Kirsten Rausing; and construction magnate Anthony Bamford — have even had skin in the game. For over 200 years, the Royal Ascot has been open to the public, with about 300,000 people attending the five-day event every year. But don't expect to get near the rich and famous. Joining the Royal Enclosure requires a special application process, including having two sponsors. Plus, there's a strict dress code — no spaghetti straps or bow ties allowed. July: Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference Every July, private jets descend on the small town of Hailey, Idaho, for the summer counterpart to Davos: the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference — also known as billionaire summer camp. Since 1983, boutique investment bank Allen & Co — its president, Herbert Allen, is a billionaire himself — has hosted the event, which attracts the biggest and richest names in business, including Jeff Bezos, Sam Altman, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Warren Buffett. The conference has become known for the deals struck in between rounds of golf, guided hikes, and tennis matches. It's where Jeff Bezos snagged The Washington Post for $250 million in 2013 and where the seed for Disney's $19 billion acquisition of ABC was planted in 1995. Hot topics at the 2024 conference included the planned sale of Paramount to Skydance — with Shari Redstone making a grand entrance — artificial intelligence, and the presidential election. The vacation-cum-business-meeting is invite-only and pretty much restricted to masters of the universe dressed in vests and quarter-zips. Security is strict, with even the press walled off from most of the wheeling and dealing. But when the conference is not in session, you, too, can stay at the Sun Valley Lodge, the home base of the retreat that offers a year-round ice skating rink, luxe spa, and pool with a view of the mountains. The most basic rooms cost upward of $500 a night over the summer, and suites go for upward of $1,500. August: Burning Man On its face, Burning Man — the anticapitalist art and music festival in the Nevada desert — doesn't sound like an event for billionaires. But the richest people in the world don't seem to care about whether they're wanted. Since the 1990s, attending Burning Man has become a sort of status symbol for the tech elite. Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page are longtime Burners — the festival inspired the very first Google Doodle — as is Eric Schmidt, Google's former CEO. Facebook cofounders Dustin Moskowitz and Mark Zuckerberg, and Uber cofounder Garrett Camp have also attended. Even Ray Dalio, the billionaire hedge fund manager, wanted to see what all the hype was about and joined in on the party in 2019. While ticket sales were down last year — the event did not sell out for the first time since 2011 — the uber-rich still attended. Hundreds of private planes flew into Black Rock City's temporary airport during the festival. The starting price to charter a plane through Burner Express Air was $9,000, one way. The experiences of many celebrities and billionaires on the Playa lean less on the ""decommodification"" and ""leave no trace"" principles of the festival and more on the ""immediacy"" one — as in instant gratification. They travel around in tricked-out art cars (basically fancy golf carts) and forego rustic tents for more fancy camps, complete with furniture, air conditioning, and personal chefs who charge six figures for their services. This may explain why there was a hefty dose of schadenfreude when Burning Man went underwater, quite literally. September: The Monaco Yacht Show There are yachts, and then there are the superyachts — and those are aplenty at the Monaco Yacht Show in Monte Carlo, where billionaires gather at the end of the summer to scope out their new toys. (There are also, technically, megayachts, but for plebeian purposes, they are one and the same.) The 120-plus boats on display have an average length of 165 feet and feature elevators, bars, spas, pools, gyms, hot tubs, and helipads — sometimes more than one. Jet Skis and submersibles are popular add-ons. Last year, billionaire NFL owner Shahid Khan's superyacht Kismet debuted at the show. The yacht, which features three pools, a pickleball court, and an outdoor movie theater, is available to charter for $3.4 million a week. Billionaire Google cofounder Sergey Brin's superyacht Dragonfly was also on display. Brin, who owns several boats and water toys, is seeking to sell the ship for $30 million. In the past, yachts owned by billionaires like Paul Allen, Steve Wynn, and Pier Luigi Loro Piana have been exhibited at the show. The event also used to be a favorite of opulent Russian oligarchs, though sanctions have prevented them from attending for the past couple of years. If you're looking to peruse boats that you can't afford — or maybe to meet a billionaire who will invite you on theirs — you're in luck: The Monaco Yacht Show is open to the public for the small price of 600 Euros, or $640, a day. October: The Frieze Art Fair and Art Basel Paris October brings multiple opportunities for the rich to add to their art collections. First, the Frieze Art Fair and nearby Frieze Masters, held annually in London, focus on contemporary art and pre-21st century art, respectively. In years past, collectors like Point72's Steve Cohen, Diamond titan Laurence Graff, and the wife of hedge fund legend Louis Bacon, Gabrielle, have all been spotted there. Shortly after, across the English Channel, is Art Basel Paris, a relative newcomer to the art scene. Last year's fair drew James Murdoch, who is an investor in Art Basel's parent company, and Charles Schwabs's wife Helen, as well as celebrities like Natalie Portman and Owen Wilson. Louise Bourgeois's sculpture ""Spider I"" marked the fair's biggest sale, going for a cool $20 million, and several works went for seven-figure sums. Exactly which moneyed collectors are behind specific purchases tends to be kept under wraps. While anyone can buy tickets to the fair itself, the fetes surrounding art fairs are a more surefire place to spot a billionaire or their younger, edgier heirs. A look at party snaps from the last few years shows Gordon Getty's granddaughter Ivy Getty, Cohen's daughter Sophia, and Roger Penske's granddaughter Sophia mingling with art-world celebrities. November: Le Bal des Débutantes Le Bal des Débutantes continues the centuries-long tradition of rich, famous women presenting themselves to a slice of society. The ball is invite-only, and no one, not even billionaires, can buy their way in — at least that's what Ophélie Renouard, the founder of the ball's current iteration, told Business Insider in 2023. Renouard handpicks the cohort of about 20 women each year who go to Paris for a weekend of photoshoots, makeup and hair appointments, and traditional waltzes. Typically, at least one billionaire heiress is among the group of debutantes. Last year's class included Peyton Spaht, the daughter of billionaire private equity titan Holden Spaht; Sienna Gallienne, an heir to the Frère family fortune, and Apple Martin, the daughter of Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow, who, though not a billionaire, made headlines for her appearance. Araminta Mellon, Kayla Rockefeller, Laila Blavatnik, and Amanda Hearst have also participated in the tradition, usually with their very wealthy parents in tow. As is often the case for the rich — and rich nepo babies, in particular — things come free: The weekend's dance lessons, couture gowns, glam squads, and jewels are paid for by sponsors. December: New Year in St. Barts Billionaires ring in the New Year seemingly anywhere but at home. And while Aspen and Maldives are popular choices for the wintering elite, there is perhaps nowhere with more billionaires per square foot during the holidays than St. Barts. The Caribbean island, Saint-Barthélemy, has attracted yachts owned by the likes of David Geffen, Barry Diller and Diane von Furstenberg, and Bernard Arnault for year-end festivities. For those who don't stay on yachts, rooms at popular luxury hotels like Eden Rock and Cheval Blanc, owned by Arnault's LVMH, cost upward of $5,000.

Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes left the Post following the paper’s rejection of her artwork, which features Amazon founder and Post owner Jeff Bezos groveling to President-elect Trump. ""It shows what a different place the Washington Post is in comparison to the first Trump term. The Washington Post, honestly, the first Trump administration was rocket fuel for the Washington Post. Now you're seeing it sort of in disarray. Not only the decision not to endorse [in the 2024 presidential race] but now this. You‘ve had a lot of people leave the Post and I think this Washington institution is in a very different place,"" Thompson said. Telnaes, who has worked as a cartoonist for the Washington Post since 2008, announced via Substack she was quitting after the paper killed her cartoon, which depicted Bezos and other unspecified wealthy businessmen kneeling down and holding up bags of money to the incoming president. Mickey Mouse is shown bowing down to Trump on the floor next to them.

""She's going to be lionized by journalists everywhere, she’ll get an award from Columbia for this,"" he added. ""When Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, all those people were giving money to Joe Biden in the last administration, was that the subject of a cartoon? No it was not. It was not. This is an ideological problem. The Post deserves it."" CNN host Kasie Hunt said earlier in the discussion that the others pictured in the cartoon were Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg, OpenAI's Sam Altman and the Los Angeles Times owner Patrick Soon-Shing, who also stopped his paper from endorsing a presidential candidate this cycle. In her Substack article, ""Why I’m Quitting the Washington Post,"" Telnaes said, ""I have had editorial feedback and productive conversations—and some differences—about cartoons I have submitted for publication, but in all that time I’ve never had a cartoon killed because of who or what I chose to aim my pen at.

Telnaes’ Disney reference appears to be a dig at the company being cited as a factor behind ABC News’ recent $15 million settlement with Trump earlier this month. In her Substack piece, Telnaes continued to proclaim her belief that the Post squashed the cartoon because of its political point. She wrote, ""To be clear, there have been instances where sketches have been rejected or revisions requested, but never because of the point of view inherent in the cartoon’s commentary. That’s a game changer…and dangerous for a free press."" Fox News' Gabriel Hays contributed to this report.

My mom took care of me and my baby.,,Lifestyle,INSIDER,4 min read,Alisha Pasha moved in with her parents after giving birth to her son. She stayed there for 30 days eating home made food and sleeping.,Lauren Crosby Medlicott,2025-01-06T15:30:07.000Z,"Alisha Pasha is a 26-year-old from Pakistan, and is now living in Dubai. She had her first baby in March 2021 and stayed at her mom's house for 30 days after giving birth. Each time she visits her mom, or her mom visits her, Alisha feels she can rest. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Alisha Pasha. It has been edited for length and clarity. When I first found out I was pregnant, I was shocked. I had been planning to move with my partner to the UK to study for my Master's, but with my pregnancy, we decided to stay in Pakistan. The thought of becoming a mother was both exciting and overwhelming. I was confused about how I would manage to care for a baby while working and studying. When my son was born in March 2021, I immediately drove from where I was living to stay with my mom. In Pakistani and Indian culture, it's tradition that a woman who gives birth stays at her parents' house for 30 to 40 days before returning home. I was eager to keep this tradition, so my son and I moved in with my parents, with my partner coming back and forth for visits. For 30 days, I lived with my parents and was cared for by my mom. She went out of her way to care for me, her child. She'd sleep with me, waking whenever I woke to feed the baby, letting me sleep while she held him. During the day, my son often slept, so I would sleep then, too, knowing my mom was sorting everything else that needed doing in the house. My mom cooked every single meal for me during those early weeks. I never set foot in the kitchen. All the meals she made me were cooked with ingredients aiding in recovery after birth. I remember drinking a lot of chicken and beef broth and having turmeric milk every night. She was taking care of me so I could take care of my baby and rest after labor. I was both a mother and a child during those 30 days. When I returned home after being at my mom's house, life felt difficult. It was a huge adjustment to learn how to juggle my work and the baby. My partner is a very hands-on dad, but his job required him to work long hours, so most of the caring responsibility was left to me. While we lived in Pakistan, I would drive four hours with my son every two months to stay with my parents. As soon as I got close to their house, I could feel the 'mother' in me leave my body. It was like a child would come into my soul — I knew both myself and my baby were about to be taken care of by my mom. I'd often save a lot of my work for these trips, as my parents could have the baby, and take care of all the household duties. In October, my partner and I moved to Dubai, a three-and-a-half-hour plane ride from my mom. Recently, my mom and dad visited us. It was the first time I had ever hosted them in my house. I wanted to take care of them while they were here, as they have always been the ones taking care of me and my baby. But my mom, being my mom, constantly helped out around the house. She mended clothes, cooked food, mopped floors, and cleaned dishes. I tried so hard to stop her, but I suppose it's in her nature to help her own child as much as she could. She wanted me to rest, and I did. Just her being around gave me the license to relax. My parents' visits have been good for me and my son. He loves his grandparents so much. I love their bond and seeing how the little child in them bursts out when they're around him. One day, I know I'll be the kind of mom to my son that my mom has been to me.

James Lee Williams, who performed under the drag name The Vivienne, was 32 years old, the BBC and The New York Times reported. Williams’ manager did not announce a cause of death. Filmmaker and husband to Aubrey Plaza, Jeff Baena, dies at 47 “It is with immense sadness that we let you know our beloved James Lee Williams — The Vivienne, has passed this weekend,” Simon Jones, of Simon Jones PR, wrote Sunday. “James was an incredibly loved, warm-hearted and amazing person,” Jones continued. “Their family are heartbroken at the loss of their son, brother and uncle. They are so proud of the wonderful things James achieved in their life and career.” Jones asked Williams’ fans to give their family privacy, and added that “further details” of Williams’ passing would not be released. Williams, who was born in Wales before moving to Liverpool, was originally chosen as the “UK ambassador” for “RuPaul’s Drag Race” during a 2015 event hosted by RuPaul in London. In 2019, they competed on — and won — the first season of the show’s U.K. iteration. In the following years, Williams made an appearance on “RuPaul’s Drag Race” and competed on “RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars.” In a piece for London’s The Times in 2020, Williams said they were first drawn to drag by English comedian Paul O’Grady, who was known for his drag personal Lily Savage. Williams later began developing her own persona after seeing drag queens at a club in Liverpool. “These people were getting paid to have a great night and entertain people. I knew immediately that was what I wanted to do.” Actor from ‘Seinfeld,’ ‘Ace Ventura’ dies at 83 In the same Times piece, Williams discussed their past struggles with “party drugs” and the recovery they achieved with the help of an LGBTQ+ support group in Liverpool. In addition to drag, Williams was a musical theater performer, appearing in touring productions of “The Wizard of Oz” and “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,” The New York Times reported.

Since 2023, rumors have swirled that X user Adrian Dittmann, a Musk acolyte with more than 222,000 followers, is really a burner account created by the world’s richest man. “You’re an amazing father, Elon. Your kids are very lucky to have you,” Dittmann wrote in a January 2024 post. “Elon is a father who gets lots of sex. He will never stoop to the lows of anger and posting emotionally like a lot of people expected him to,” read another Dittmann missive that has since been deleted. Musk has 12 kids with three women. Most of his children were conceived via IVF. Dittmann’s rhetorical style and questionable takes—which have been disputed by Musk’s daughter—had convinced many users that Dittmann was really Musk. But a detailed analysis by Jacqueline Sweet in The Spectator over the weekend seemed to put that speculation to rest. The report concluded that alleged Musk superfan Adrian Dittmann was in fact a German Musk superfan named Adrian Dittmann living in Fiji. The Fiji Dittmann’s biography lines up with highly specific geographical and personal details revealed by the X user Dittmann, including the time zones on some of his posts and the fact that he lives in Oceania but grew up in Gibraltar. (The Fiji Dittmann’s entrepreneur father was based in Gibraltar in the early 2000s, according to financial records.) Cross referencing social media accounts belonging to the Fiji Dittmann’s family confirmed other information that the Musk disciple Dittmann posted to X. And perhaps most convincingly, when Sweet contacted the Fiji Dittmann to ask about certain posts, the X user Dittmann suddenly deleted the corroborating information. The whole thing was fairly garden-variety internet weird, until Sweet shared a link to her story on X. Musk himself responded to her post, writing, “I am Adrian Dittmann. It’s time the world knew.” I am Adrian Dittmann. It’s time the world knew. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 5, 2025 Within hours, X took down Sweet’s post, blocked her from posting for 30 days, and blocked users from posting the link to her story on X, The Spectator’s managing editor revealed on the site. The link was labeled as “unsafe,” according to Mediaite, with Sweet presumably blocked for “doxxing” Adrian Dittmann, or revealing his identity—even though it turned out he was in fact using his real name and posting his real information. The Daily Beast has reached out to X for comment. it appears that @JSweetLI has had her @x account restricted for her @TheSpectator reporting into @AdrianDittmann not being an @elonmusk alt account… https://t.co/EYQ9Xfyrkj pic.twitter.com/GyPdcq1Lfq — Matt McDonald (@mattjpfmcdonald) January 5, 2025 Users were quick to accuse Musk, who claims to be a free-speech crusader, of censoring Sweet.

A barefoot Meghan, who just four months ago allegedly claimed she was one of the most bullied people in the world due to social media, was pictured on a California beach scratching “2025” into the sand. She was alone, but friendly media were briefed that @meghan was being filmed by her husband, Prince Harry, heading off another round of uncomfortable speculation about their preference for being seen separately these days. Calendar date aside, the timing was, prima facie, odd. The horrific terror attack in New Orleans that grabbed global headlines and left ten people dead and hundreds injured and traumatized had happened just a few hours earlier, and the Cybertruck explosion in Las Vegas happened after the account was activated. By a tragic and bizarre coincidence it would later emerge that one of the victims of the New Orleans attack, Edward Pettifer, was the brother of one of Harry’s godchildren and the stepson of his beloved former nanny, Tiggy Legge Bourke. Meghan McCain would later accuse the princess of being “utterly tone deaf” by launching her account at such a moment. The reason for pressing on despite the horror-struck national mood soon became clear when Meghan made a second post to the account, the trailer for her new cooking show, With Love, Meghan. In truth, if Meghan wants to sell us anything, she did not have much choice but to get back on social media, the shop window of the world. The trailer—Meghan baking, Meghan goofing off and Meghan telling us she wants to seek joy—may or may not be your thing, but is undeniably a perfect bit of insipid Insta-fluff. It has already racked her up over a million follows: as social media consultant Lauren Spearman told The Daily Beast: “The trailer for the show appears to be ‘trad wife meets tablescaping,’ and where better than Instagram to document that.” Needless to say it has been monstered by Meghan’s critics and praised by her fans. Netflix will release the show on Jan. 15, five days before the inauguration, which some cynics might say suggests Netflix boss Ted Sarandos doesn’t expect it to occupy the nosecone of the nation’s attention. While the cooking show may vanish into the Netflix ether, social media experts and consultants who spoke to The Daily Beast argued that Meghan’s presence as a figure on social media is here to stay, and that handled correctly, she could make millions from a new life as super influencer. While she has so far limited her exposure to the relatively non-toxic Instagram, ultimately any coherent strategy will see her activate accounts on multiple platforms, says Gary Frayter, celebrity social media director at Kronus Communications. Frayter told The Daily Beast: “YouTube is the king of all platforms. If I were advising them, I’d tell them to double down on YouTube. It’s the hardest platform to grow on, but the rewards are unmatched when it comes to sponsorships and ad revenue through YouTube AdSense. I could definitely see her finding success on TikTok. The platform aligns well with her public image and offers a lot of potential for engagement. However, X has become way too political in her world. She’s very protective of her public image and probably wouldn’t touch X. Besides, her target demographic isn’t really there; it’s just not the right fit for her brand.” Frayter said that Meghan could make huge sums as the first royal super influencer if she can manage her accounts well. He said: “They could each make hundreds of thousands per post, no question. Having managed social media for Mike Tyson’s podcast and other celebrities, I’ve seen firsthand what they earn. “I’d argue Meghan could easily pull in $100k per post, minimum. The same goes for Harry.” Matt Yanofsky, CEO of the Moment Lab, a Canadian social media marketing agency, told The Daily Beast: “You would need to know their internal metrics on engagement to get an exact quote on what they would make. It would also depend on the project. If she’s just doing one post, it could be in the thousands. If she’s doing multiple posts over a year, it could be a seven-figure deal similar to a traditional fashion deal. “The problem is, it’s unclear if Meghan can sell products. She generates headlines, but does she move units? Just because people want to watch you doesn’t mean they want to buy your products.” Yanofsky adds: “People want authenticity. She’s anything but authentic, and that’s why she struggles to sell products.” Warren Johnson, founder of W Communications, who has worked on social campaigns for a wealth of clients including Sony and Disney, told The Daily Beast: “The cooking show probably isn’t going to set the world on fire, so the more interesting question is: how can they harness social media to their advantage? The model here is the Kim Kardashian playbook. Build a huge audience, engage authentically, and back it with a solid product. If she works at it and controls her narrative, she could redefine her brand and monetize it massively.” However Johnson says that Meghan might have been unwise to make the second thing she posted on her new account a Netflix promo, saying that generally it’s considered better practice to build up a fanbase and a community before you start the hard sell. Although she now has 1.4 million followers, that figure needs to be closer to 20 or 30 million, Johnson says, to convince partners in the entertainment business that you are bringing a significant “distribution ecosystem to the table.” (For reference: Ryan Reynolds has 53 million followers on Instagram while Kate and William have 17 million.) Johnson says: “Just dumping clips won’t cut it. Engagement is everything. You’ve got to work at it. You get back what you put in.” Meghan and Harry’s office did not return a request for comment.",24,[],2025-01-06 19:22:48,2025-01-06 19:22:48

The legal system is broken, and businesses can’t take a chance in getting caught up in this quicksand. IT’S ALL RIGGED, in this case against a political opponent, ME!!!"" Trump posted to Truth Social on Sunday evening of the case. Trump’s sentencing in the case has been repeatedly delayed. Trump's lawyers had asked Merchan to overturn the former president’s guilty verdict after the Supreme Court ruled in July that former presidents have substantial immunity from prosecution for official acts in office, but not for unofficial acts.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/entertainment/nikki-glaser-triumphs-host-revived-145611900.html,Nikki Glaser triumphs as the host of a revived 82nd Golden Globes,,Opinion,Salon,8 min read,"It's been years since a Golden Globes telecast was this entertaining, and not just due to its successful emcee",Melanie McFarland,2025-01-06T14:56:11.000Z,"Last year’s Golden Globes telecast provided its strongest case yet for its retirement from public life. The previous version of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association imploded after having the open secret of its corruption exposed. NBC, its longtime broadcast partner, dumped it. Even after Dick Clark Productions (owned by Penske Media Corporation, which also owns every major Hollywood trade publication) and Eldridge Industries, a private equity firm, snatched its cadaver from the side of a Hollywood freeway and CBS agreed to air its production, no entertainer of note wanted to get its lingering stink on them. They had to make do with Jo Koy, who had mere days to prepare and bombed spectacularly. For reasons having absolutely nothing to do with Koy – “Barbenheimer,” mainly — the 81st Golden Globes garnered the telecast’s highest ratings in four years, guaranteeing the show would go on. But Koy’s faceplant made a person wonder if the Globes requires any human shepherds. Its ceremony went host-free for its first 38 years, as well as between 1996 and 2009. On Sunday, Nikki Glaser proved all that it needed was the right one, and to give that person time to prepare her material. The Globes certainly took its sweet time in tapping a woman to host solo. That’s right: Glaser is the first, and it took 82 Globes telecasts for that to happen. She’s a seasoned TV host, having helmed “Not Safe with Nikki Glaser” on Comedy Central and playing the ringmaster on “FBoy Island.” Another claim to fame of Glaser's is talking frankly about sex and pornography – she's a big fan of both. “I am absolutely thrilled to be your host tonight,” she said in her opener, “And I gotta say, this feels like I finally made it. You know? I’m in a room full of producers at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, and this time all of my clothes are on. That was worth it!” For years, the Golden Globes telecast spiked its reputation as the awards season’s most freewheeling, booze-fueled broadcasts by employing Ricky Gervais, who pushed the boundaries of good taste. Gervais’ increasing coarseness was interrupted by the one-two punch of Tina Fey and Amy Poehler playing the part of everybody’s funny friend in the room. Gervais reveled at making Globe attendees angry; Fey and Poehler would take a few clawless swipes but generally left the impression that they were laughing with them. Maybe Glaser studied those approaches. Maybe she naturally understands that nobody wants to walk away from this self-congratulation fest with a bitter taste in their mouths. However she prepared, the comedian found a way to plant her flag in the middle of the Globes’ rowdiness scale. The extent to which Glaser slayed her part cannot be overstated. She was spicy without immolating her targets, respectful without feeling phony or fawning. We will remember her for the right reasons and some saucy jokes. Mind you, Glaser still knew when and how to dance on the edge. After acknowledging the truth about what the Globes mean to the industry by joking, “Tonight, we celebrate the best film and hold space for television,” Glaser launched her first rocket into the blue. “’Wicked,’  ‘Queer,’ ‘Nightbitch’: These are not just words Ben Affleck yells after he orgasms. These are some of the incredible movies nominated tonight,” she joked, then continued with: “’The Bear,’ ‘The Penguin,’ ‘Baby Reindeer’: These are not just things found in R.F.K.’s freezer. These are TV shows nominated tonight.” For the most part, Glaser kept her promise not to roast anybody, merely delivering the equivalent of a light blowtorch caramelizing to seasoned pros like Harrison Ford and Stanley Tucci, who gamely grinned when Glaser ventured to pull off a Diddy crack. In reaction to the audience groaning at a line about “Challengers” being more sexually charged than one of the disgraced hip-hop producer’s credit cards, she said, “I’m upset too! The afterparty’s not going to be as good this year. But we have to move on! A ‘Stanley Tucci Freak-Off’ doesn’t have the same ring to it. No baby oil this year, just lots of olive oil.” Other than that, and an extended riff on Timothée Chalamet’s confusingly sparse mustache (“You have the most gorgeous eyelashes on your upper lip,” she said) Glaser’s contributions added to the production instead of distracting from it. Not all her punchlines landed solidly, but none turned off the audience in the room or viewers watching at home. And if you’ve watched enough award shows over the years, you might recognize the chances she took with her version of bits other hosts attempted before only to die onstage. Way back in ancient times, Oscar host David Letterman tried to wring yuks from saying Uma Thurman’s name and Oprah Winfrey’s over and over again and was met by silence; Glaser imitated Adam Sandler saying Chalamet’s name, then got Sandler himself to say it, and it was dumb. But we laughed. Sorta. Glaser knows awards shows gags are insipid. She lowkey acknowledged what indulgent duds musical performances can be when she donned a miter, threatening to mash up “Conclave” and “Wicked” by singing, “You’re gonna be . . . Pope-ular” before pretending to get the hook from the production booth. “Wait, this sucks?”. . .This whole thing sucks?” she says in her pretend earpiece. “I’m embarrassing myself in front of Elton John? OK, let’s skip to the next song, the TV one about ‘The Penguin,’ the ‘Insane in the Pen-gwain’? . . . That sucks too?” Stupid live skits being a terrible idea seems obvious to everybody in 2025, but in case you’ve forgotten, a past Emmys ceremony featured the man who is now our President-elect (again) and a felon (34 times) singing the theme to “Green Acres” beside Megan Mullally. A host can only work so much magic to make an awards show watchable, but Sunday’s 82nd Golden Globes telecast was a rare case of the production matching the talent’s enthusiasm and caliber. Ricky Kirshner and Glenn Weiss returned as the show’s executive producers and showrunners, with Weiss directing. That might have been a terrible decision given last year’s disaster but, miracle of miracles, Kirshner and Weiss turned those mistakes into a lesson. Not across the board, of course — the presenters’ scripts were still stodgy, but when aren’t they? Besides, with teleprompter mishaps ruling the night and pros like Jennifer Coolidge going magnificently AWOL when we need them to, punch-ups are a waste of energy and time. Instead, the attention-getters were the technological bells and whistles. This year’s Globes evolved to meet the age of streaming and online dominance by incorporating Maps-style location icons to show where a nominee was placed in the room and Pop-Up Video-style windows containing trivia about each presenter and winner. This linked nicely to Glaser’s mid-show scorecard featuring a tally of the most thanked. Cast and crew led with 11 mentions, she announced, with moms coming in second with three, and “God, creator of the universe” netting a goose egg – one less than Mario Lopez, host of ""Access Hollywood,"" with one. But, indeed, it’s funny because it’s true and was at times touching as when Colin Farrell called his thank you speech for his best actor in a limited series win for “The Penguin” by thanking Carolina in craft service. Want a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course. Past awards shows included banners listing an actor’s past wins and nominations, but this also included details like a nominee’s first job or, for example, that the Vancouver Aquarium named an octopus after Canadian hero Seth Rogen. This may be an effort to mitigate the audience’s urge to divide attention between second screens or to capitalize on the mainstreaming of closed captioning in streaming content. In any case, depending on what type of information consumer you are, these trivia boxes coupled with the announcers’ “did you know” offerings were either a bounteous accessory or an overload. It was nice to find out from Coolidge that Billy Bob Thornton has an emotional support coyote (which is . . . probably not true?) and that asteroid 17744 was named after Jodie Foster (which, can confirm, is true). Fascinating as some of these fun facts were, the wins on the TV side were mostly predictable and, as Glaser remarked, are there to “hold space” – they have none of the impact on Emmys that the Globes have on the Oscars. That “Shogun” and “Hacks” won the top drama and comedy series prizes were foregone conclusions, as were “Shogun” stars Hiroyuki Sanada and Anna Sawai’s best drama actor and actress wins, and “Hack” star Jean Smart and “The Bear” lead Jeremy Allen White’s win for best comedy actress and actor. All have won Emmys for their roles, and this is White’s third Globe win for “The Bear,” accepted this time in absentia. But these were fine wins even so, as were the hardware scores for limited series winner “Baby Reindeer” and Jessica Gunning for limited series supporting actress, as well as Jodie Foster’s deserved notice for her turn in “True Detective: Night Country,” matching her Emmy win for the role. The Globes had a few surprises within their favored contenders too, like Tadanobu Asano's supporting actor clinch for “Shogun.” That said, if the Globes had been Globes-ing like before, the biggest movie stars in the best stand-up performance category would have won. Somehow Ali Wong bested Jamie Foxx and Adam Sandler – and Glaser, who also received a nod — to claim the prize. That was one more sparkle in a drink that washed away the garbage flavor of last year’s awards – a Corpse Reviver, let’s call it. In the wake of Sunday’s success, the Golden Globes telecast isn’t likely to struggle with finding a host. But it could do a lot worse than inviting Glaser back for another round. She’s a sure thing.",0,[],2025-01-06 19:23:21,2025-01-06 22:19:24

On Monday afternoon, Harris will oversee a joint session of Congress, when lawmakers will certify President-elect Donald Trump's victory over the current vice president in November's election. The vice president said her mission is to ensure a peaceful transfer of power from one administration to the next.

""It is up to each of us to stand up for our most cherished principles,"" the vice president emphasized. The Capitol was attacked hours after Trump, at a large rally on the National Mall near the White House, repeated his unproven claims that the 2020 election was riddled with massive voter fraud and stolen from him. Trump urged then-Vice President Mike Pence not to certify the election results, a request that Pence disregarded. Harris, in her role of presiding over the Senate, becomes the first vice president to oversee the congressional confirmation of their electoral loss since then-Vice President Al Gore did it in January 2001, following his razor-thin defeat to then-Texas Gov.

Four decades earlier, then-Vice President Richard Nixon presided over the certification of his narrow election loss in a 1960 showdown with then-Sen. John F. Kennedy.

In a Friday order, Judge Juan Merchan dealt the final blow to any suggestions of serious consequences for the president-elect’s guilty verdict. Merchan wrote that “unconditional discharge” had become the “the most viable solution” for Trump, indicating that the incoming president would not be hampered down with fines, court-appointed supervision, or incarceration. But that outcome was, apparently, not satisfactory for the convicted felon, who took to Truth Social to rant about how the lingering effects of the trial still prevented him from bad-mouthing the judge. “D.A. Alvin Bragg never wanted to bring this lawless case against me,” Trump wrote on his social media platform. “He was furious at the way it was handled, and especially angry at MARK POMERANTZ for his behavior, and what he did. Ultimately, the Biden/Harris DOJ forced Bragg to concoct anything to embarrass TRUMP.” “But it was even more so what the CORRUPT and TOTALLY CONFLICTED POLITICAL HACK Judge did, and is doing, on this sham trial,” Trump continued. “I even have, STILL, an Unconstitutional Gag Order where I am not allowed to speak about the Judge’s highly disqualifying Conflicts of Interest. Virtually ever legal scholar and pundit says THERE IS NO (ZERO!) CASE AGAINST ME.” Trump also claimed that New York’s legal system was fundamentally corrupt and was contributing to the fleeing of businesses from the country’s banking capital. “The Judge fabricated the facts, and the law, no different than the other New York Judicial and Prosecutorial Witch Hunts,” Trump wrote. “That’s why businesses are fleeing New York, taking with them millions of jobs, and BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TAXES. The legal system is broken, and businesses can’t take a chance in getting caught up in this quicksand. IT’S ALL RIGGED, in this case against a political opponent, ME!!!” Although Trump will face consequences more or less in name only, former U.S. District Attorney Joyce Vance argued in her legal column Civil Discourse that there could still be a light at the end of the tunnel in Merchan’s order. Rather than forcing sentencing before Trump’s inauguration, Merchan’s decision to release Trump with “unconditional discharge” effectively takes the wind out of Trump’s sails should he try to do away with the criminal conviction altogether, according to Vance. It could also help delay Trump’s sentencing until he’s out of office again, in which case, all bets are off.",118,[],2025-01-06 19:23:21,2025-01-06 19:23:21

She seemingly debuted the diamond at Sunday's Golden Globe awards.,Taryn RyderReporter,2025-01-06T17:55:57.000Z,"It was the question on everyone's mind at Sunday's Golden Globes: Are Zendaya and Tom Holland engaged? According to reports, the answer is yes. The 28-year-old actress sparked engagement speculation when she wore a diamond ring on that finger. Inside the ballroom at the Beverly Hilton, the Challengers star made no effort to hide what was on her left hand. She was pictured seemingly showing friends, like The Bear star Ayo Edebiri, her new hardware. According to TMZ, which was first to report Holland and Zendaya's engagement, the actor proposed over the holidays at one of her homes ""in a very intimate setting."" The Spider-Man co-stars have been together since at least 2021. People magazine later confirmed the two were engaged. Zendaya was decked out in Bulgari jewelry at the Globes, according to a press release, but there was no credit for the sparkler on her left hand. People magazine reported that the ring appears to be a Jessica McCormack diamond that is listed in the engagement rings section of the company website. If Zendaya's ring is the one speculated about online, it's 5.02 carats and is a Georgian-style cut in 18k white-and-yellow gold. The brand posted about actress-filmmaker Zoë Kravitz wearing its jewelry to the Golden Globes, but there was no mention of Zendaya's hardware. Yahoo Entertainment contacted the designer but did not immediately receive a response. A rep for the actress did not comment. Los Angeles Times reporter Amy Kaufman, herself recently engaged, had an interesting interaction with the Dune star at the Globes when it came to the supposed engagement ring. “As Zendaya exited the ballroom, a recently engaged Times reporter held up her left ring finger and pointed at it,” Kaufman wrote on Sunday. “The actor responded by flashing her own bling on her left hand, doing a sort of jazz-fingers motion.” ""Are you engaged?” the Los Angeles Times asked. According to the report, Zendaya ""smiled coyly and shrugged her shoulders mysteriously."" Zendaya and Holland have starred in three Spider-Man films together. However, they do not walk red carpet events with each other if they are not related to those movies, hence his absence on Sunday night. ""It’s not my moment, it's her moment, and if we go together, it’s about us,"" Holland recently told Men's Health. Neither Holland nor Zendaya has made a public statement about their relationship status.

A look back at their infamous ‘Fast and Furious’ feud.,,Entertainment,Yahoo Celebrity,9 min read,"Two words — ""Hey, Dwayne"" — at the Golden Globes has dredged up the past feud between the ""Fast & Furious"" co-stars.",Suzy ByrneReporter,2025-01-06T16:32:53.000Z,"With a “Hey, Dwayne,” the long-running “candy-ass” feud between Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson is back in the news. The Fast & Furious franchise co-stars were both presenters at the Golden Globes on Jan. 5. Johnson fulfilled his duties early in the show. When Diesel took the stage later, he went off-script by shouting out his frenemy in the audience. Diesel had a smile on his face as he did it, aware he was stirring things up. The cameras awkwardly cut to Johnson, who briefly flashed a smile, and the audience erupted at the acknowledgment of the long-running drama between them. The men are seemingly on OK terms these days — Johnson didn’t pull a Will Smith or anything — but it’s a been a journey… 2011: Diesel had long portrayed Dominic Toretto in F&F when Johnson joined the franchise as Luke Hobbs for Fast Five. The film became the highest-grossing one in the film canon, and Johnson is credited for reigniting an aging franchise. 2013: They continued as co-stars. The franchise was delivered a blow when cast member Paul Walker died in a car crash while Furious 7 was being made. 2016: While working on the eighth film, The Fate of the Furious, Johnson used Instagram to call out unnamed male co-stars in a now-deleted post. “There’s no other franchise that gets my blood boiling more than this one. An incredibly hardworking crew,"" he wrote. “Some conduct themselves as stand-up men and true professionals, while others don’t. The ones that don’t are too chicken shit to do anything about it anyway. Candy asses. When you watch this movie next April and it seems like I'm not acting in some of these scenes and my blood is legit boiling — you're right.” When Fate wrapped that August, Diesel shared a video reflecting on making the film and seemingly referenced the Johnson drama, saying, “Honestly, give me a second and I will tell you everything. Everything.” That November, Johnson addressed his “candy asses” post in a Los Angeles Times interview: ""I was very clear with what I said. I’ve been in the game a long time. Would Universal [Pictures] have preferred that didn't happen? Sure, we talked about it. The irony is after that, and as they do their tracking and all their analysis, the interest [in the film] shot through the roof to a whole other level."" 2017: Diesel told USA Today the dispute between ""two alphas"" was magnified by the media: ""I don't think the world really realizes how close we are, in a weird way. I think some things may be blown out of proportion. I don’t think that was [Johnson's] intention. I know he appreciates how much I work this franchise. In my house, he's Uncle Dwayne."" Diesel also said that as producer of the franchise, it was his job to “protect” it and everyone involved “including Dwayne. I protected Dwayne more than he’ll ever know.” He called himself Johnson’s “big brother” and said he’s “always rooting for Dwayne. I’m the first multicultural megastar in Hollywood. They didn’t exist. To see another multicultural star come up is something I am very proud of.” Diesel and Johnson attended the F8 premiere but didn’t pose for photos together. Diesel told Entertainment Tonight that he and Johnson “still love each other."" Johnson told the outlet that he and Diesel had ""differing philosophies.” Johnson finalized a deal for a Fast & Furious spin-off, Hobbs & Shaw, tagging his social media announcement post: ""#CandyAssesNeedNotApply."" When franchise co-star Tyrese became upset that Fast & Furious 9 was pushed back to allow for the spin-off, Diesel defended the decision in an Instagram post with a photo of him with Johnson in the franchise. He wrote about “brotherhood ... and all its complexities,” and said it’s “unfair to say it is anyone's fault” that the ninth film was delayed. 2018: Johnson pulled back the curtain on the feud with Rolling Stone. He confirmed that he and Diesel “were not in any scenes together” in F8, shooting around each other. He said their disagreement was about professionalism and revealed they had “an important face-to-face in my trailer. And what I came to realize is that we have a fundamental difference in philosophies on how we approach moviemaking and collaborating. It took me some time, but I’m grateful for that clarity. Whether we work together again or not ... I wish him all the best, and I harbor no ill will there, just because of the clarity we have. Actually, you can erase that last part about 'no ill will.' We'll just keep it with the clarity."" 2019: Johnson confirmed he wouldn't appear in F9. The Hobbs & Shaw film comes out, and it’s a hit. Johnson thanks his “brother Vin for your support.” He ends his post with, ""I'll be seeing you soon, Toretto,"" suggesting he’d rejoin the main franchise in the future. 2021: F9: The Fast Saga is released without Johnson. Diesel talked about the Johnson drama to Men's Health. He claimed the feud was something he started to get a better performance out of Johnson, claiming, ""It was a tough character to embody, the Hobbs character. My approach at the time was a lot of tough love to assist in getting that performance where it needed to be. As a producer to say, OK, we’re going to take Dwayne Johnson, who’s associated with wrestling, and we’re going to force this cinematic world, audience members, to regard his character as someone that they don’t know — Hobbs hits you like a ton of bricks. That’s something that I’m proud of, that aesthetic. That took a lot of work. We had to get there and sometimes, at that time, I could give a lot of tough love. Not Felliniesque, but I would do anything I’d have to do in order to get performances in anything I’m producing.” Johnson reacted to the Hollywood Reporter, saying, “I think everyone had a laugh at that — and I’ll leave it at that.” He also suggested he was done with the franchise, saying, “I wish them the best of luck on Fast 10 and Fast 11 and the rest of the Fast & Furious movies they do that will be without me."" Johnson got into the “bullshit” in an interview with Vanity Fair. He said he “shouldn’t have shared” the “candy asses” post, but it was irritated by ""the same old shit.” He talked about his confrontation with Diesel over it in his trailer, saying, “I wouldn’t call it a peaceful meeting.” He said “philosophically” they're ""different people.” Johnson also responded to some of Diesel's comments: about being two alpha males (""sounds like him to say that, sure""), calling Johnson Hollywood's second ""multicultural megastar"" behind him (""he talks like that""), Diesel saying he's Johnson's protective big brother (""I have one big brother, and it's my half brother"") and the Fellini reference (“I laughed.”) Johnson's Netflix movie Red Notice included a joke about Diesel said by Ryan Reynolds. “That was Ryan. He came up with that,” Johnson insisted to Entertainment Tonight. Diesel posted an open letter to his ""little brother Dwayne"" to end their feud — and get him to sign on for Fast & Furious 10. He asked the man “my children refer to [as] Uncle Dwayne” to bury the hatchet so he could fulfill his promise to Walker and give the franchise a fitting end. Johnson told CNN he was ""very surprised"" by Diesel’s post, calling it ""an example of his manipulation."" He said, “This past June, when Vin and I actually connected not over social media, I told him directly — and privately — that I would not be returning to the franchise. I was firm yet cordial with my words and said that I would always be supportive of the cast and always root for the franchise to be successful but that there was no chance I would return.” Johnson added that he “didn’t like” Diesel bringing up Walker or his children in the post. “Leave them out of it.” 2023: Johnson made a surprise post-credits cameo in Fast X. Director Louis Leterrier took credit for brokering “the peace treaty” between the men. “We reached out to Dwayne and his team and said, ‘Just come and watch the movie,’” he said. “He [did] and really loved it, and then we started talking. It was very smooth."" Johnson confirmed on Instagram he’d fully return to the franchise. “Despite us having our differences, me and Vin, we’ve been like brothers for years, and despite our differences, when you lead with — number one, resolve — but also you think about the future and plans that are much bigger than ourselves,” he wrote. Fast X: Part 2 was announced but was delayed due to the Screen Actors Guild strike. 2024: Eight years after Johnson criticized Diesel’s work ethic, Johnson was called out out for “lack of professionalism” by more than a dozen people who worked with him on Red One. He later called it “bullshit.” On Thanksgiving, Diesel posted a photo with Johnson suggesting that the characters will be resolving their differences onscreen. He said the film is expected in March 2026, but they are determining whether the finale will be one or two films. 2025: Diesel surprised the audience — and Johnson — when he came out to present during the Golden Globes and said, “Hello, Dwayne,” before delivering his lines. It’s thought to be a nod to past differences as they’ve buried the hatchet — for now.",29,[],2025-01-06 19:24:27,2025-01-07 01:53:14

""Wait, is she engaged?"" ""Did you see the diamond?"" ""That's definitely an engagement ring, right?"" That's just a taste of what was overheard on the red carpet and inside the ballroom as even some of Hollywood's elite were curious whether Holland proposed. Well, spoiler alert, reports on Monday claim Tom Holland did indeed pop the question. Yahoo Entertainment reached out to Zendaya's rep but did not immediately receive a response. More proof that Zendaya is the talk of the town? She debuted an outfit change midshow that garnered the same attention as her ring. Does it seem like a random pairing on paper? Maybe. But Eisenberg — who directed the nominated film A Real Pain — approached Jolie as the actress entered the ballroom and complimented her as a filmmaker before the show started. Jolie told him to set up lunch so they could talk more. Here's hoping that happens. The comedian told Yahoo Entertainment she wanted celebrities to ""come ready to laugh,"" and they did. Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco were good sports when she roasted him: ""Benny Blanco is here because of the genie who granted him that wish. Man, lucky guy."" The room erupted into laughter when Glaser quipped about the attendees' sway with the public: ""I mean, you could really do anything, except tell the country who to vote for."" The joke with the most ""yikes"" faces? The one about Diddy, but that's to be expected. Glaser's Ben Affleck zinger had more people laughing. Overall, the room was very complimentary of Glaser's monologue and three-hour hosting duty. ""She really killed it,"" one studio executive was heard saying. The two have history. (A lot of it.) But they didn't appear to make amends at the Globes. When Diesel called out Johnson onstage, it was probably the right thing to do considering they were about 20 feet away from each other. The ""hey, Dwayne"" got laughs in the room. (""Oh my God, I forgot about that whole thing,"" one person said at their table.) However, the bit didn't seem planned. Johnson smiled and laughed, but the two didn't appear to have a secret meet-up during a commercial break. The actor was nominated for both The Apprentice and A Different Man. He won his first Golden Globe for Best Actor Male Actor Comedy or Musical for the latter A24 film. When his name was read in both categories, Stan garnered a lot of cheers from the crowd. It's clear he's got good momentum going into this awards season. It was a family affair for many of Hollywood's biggest names. Jolie brought Zahara as her date and was protective of her daughter inside the show, making sure she was by her side. Glen Powell brought his parents, and Golden Globe winner Zoe Saldaña brought her mom. The stars and Golden Globe nominees had a nice moment inside the ballroom. The two were seen chatting and, from afar, it didn't appear Culkin was roasting Strong about his hat. As Stone was standing near her table inside the ballroom, the Wicked star made sure to say hello. Erivo, who was nominated for Best Performance by a Female Actor in a Motion Picture — Musical or Comedy, tapped Stone on her way inside. The two have met before, at the 2022 Met Gala, but Erivo specifically wanted to compliment Stone on her hair. ""I love it,"" she was overheard saying. The producer, who popped the question to Gomez in December 2024, wanted to give his fiancée her moment on the red carpet. He was spotted darting inside the hotel solo while she did her thing. When the two found each other before the show, they didn't leave each other's sides. Gomez, who was a double nominee for Only Murders in the Building and Emilia Pérez, made sure Blanco was comfortable inside as they had some sweet PDA moments. During commercial breaks, at least two Gomez songs played in the ballroom (""Good for You"" being one of them). The stars were seen having a sweet moment near their tables as they both gave each other their respective flowers. Wicked didn't take home as many awards as expected, but it's clear even celebrities loved the film as much as audiences did.

States of emergency were declared in seven states and the District of Columbia, where 16 inches of snow was forecast to fall. Up to 18 inches of snow fell in Kansas, forcing the closure of I-70. More than 5 feet of snow was reported in western New York. The storm’s arrival comes as an Arctic air mass is expected to send temperatures plunging as far south as the Gulf Coast. Forecasters say those frigid temperatures will remain through mid-January. The storm has caused severe air travel disruptions. According to FlightAware, more than 1,800 flights in and out of the U.S. have been canceled so far, including nearly 500 at Reagan National and more than 250 at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, which issued a temporary ground stop earlier Monday due to snow and ice. The Federation Aviation Administration warned that ground delays are possible this afternoon at New York's LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy International Airport and Newark Liberty International in New Jersey because of the icy conditions. More than 1,800 flights in the U.S. have been canceled so far Monday, according to FlightAware, with the vast majority due to the storm. According to federal law, airlines are required to provide refunds to customers whose flights are canceled. Here (from the Associated Press) are five tips for navigating flight cancelations: Most airlines will rebook you on a later flight for no additional charge. That depends, however, on the availability of open seats. You can ask to be put on another airline, but airlines aren’t required to put you on another carrier’s flight. If you no longer want to take the trip, or you find another way of getting to your destination, the airline is legally required to refund your money, even if you bought a nonrefundable ticket. It can help to reach out to airlines’ customer service representatives on X, the site formerly known as Twitter. You also can try calling your airline’s international help number — usually available online — since those agents can make changes to your itinerary too. On the heels of the winter storm, an arctic air mass will send temperatures plunging in 40 states this week, Fox Weather reported. ""More than 200 million people will see temperatures Monday that range from 5-30 degrees below average,"" Fox Weather said. ""Temperatures will then drop overnight below freezing for everyone across the country except the West Coast and Florida."" And it's shaping up to be a cold January, as ""frigid temperatures are expected to remain in place across the eastern half of the country for at least the next two weeks."" The storm is wreaking havoc on the nation's roadways. Virginia State Police said they responded to more than 200 vehicle crashes in a 12-hour period between 4 p.m. Sunday and 4 a.m. Monday, though not all accidents were storm-related. Similar figures were reported in Kentucky, where dispatchers responded to more than 170 vehicle accidents and over 280 stranded motorists. Officials in those states and others are urging people to stay off the roads. “This is a significant snow and ice event, so the roadways are still dangerous,” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said. “You might be able to see the pavement, but that doesn’t mean that it’s not slick."" The ongoing winter storm has knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of people, from Illinois to Virginia.

While federal offices are closed today because of the weather, Congress is still set to meet later this afternoon on Capitol Hill to certify President-elect Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 election. In addition to heavy snow in the mid-Atlantic, other areas of the country will see moderate to severe weather on Monday. According to the latest forecast from the National Weather Service, severe thunderstorms will develop over parts of the Southeast, which could produce isolated tornadoes. Lake-effect snow will continue to fall across the Great Lakes and parts of the Northeast Monday. In the Pacific Northwest, coastal rain and higher-elevation snow will continue through Tuesday. The storm is also disrupting rail travel along the Northeast Corridor. According to Amtrak, at least 40 trains operating between Boston and Washington, D.C., including the popular Acela, were canceled Monday due to the impending ice and snow. Amtrak has posted a list of cancellations here. A huge snowball fight has been planned for Washington, D.C., residents on Monday morning. It's scheduled to take place at 11 a.m. ET in Meridian Hill Park. According to the DC Snowball Fight Association, it's the 15th year of ""snowbilizing the masses on DC snow days."" A snow emergency was declared in the District of Columbia ahead of Monday's snowball fight. The National Weather Service forecast that the storm ""will produce 6-12 inches of snow"" in the area. More than 60 million Americans were under a winter weather warning, advisory or watch on Sunday as the massive storm stretched from the Ohio Valley to the mid-Atlantic. At least seven states — including Kentucky, West Virginia and Virginia — as well as the District of Columbia issued emergency declarations ahead of the storm.

As a member of that elite, informal club, Carter was uniquely positioned to do important work for his successors, whether Democrat or Republican.",CALVIN WOODWARD,2025-01-06T18:01:52.000Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Jimmy Carter and the man he beat for president, Gerald Ford, got so tight after office that their friendship became a kind of buddy movie, complete with road trips that were never long enough because they had so much to gab about. Carter did not get along nearly so well with the other living presidents. The outsider president was an outlier after his presidency, too. Nevertheless, past and present occupants of the office will attend Carter's state funeral this week in what could be the largest gathering of the presidents club since five attended Washington services for George H.W. Bush in December 2018. As a member of that elite, informal club, Carter was uniquely positioned to do important work for his successors, whether Democrat or Republican. He achieved significant results at times, thanks to his public stature as a peacemaker, humanitarian and champion of democracy and his deep relationships with foreign leaders, troublemakers included. But with Carter, you never knew when he’d go rogue. This was a man so self-confident, he described himself as “probably superior” to the other ex-presidents who were still knocking about. Ornery about taking orders, he could be invaluable to the man in office, exasperating, or both at once. The others often bonded over “what an annoying cuss Carter could be,” Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy wrote in their book “The Presidents Club.” “Carter was the driven, self-righteous, impatient perfectionist who united the other club members around what seemed like an eternal question: was Jimmy Carter worth the trouble?” Carter scored successes in Haiti and Nicaragua He was, in the mind of Randall Balmer, a Dartmouth College historian of religion and Carter’s rise to the presidency. Balmer points to the violence averted in the last hours before a U.S. invasion of Haiti in 1994, when Carter, to the benefit of Democratic President Bill Clinton and countless lives saved, brokered a deal with Haiti’s military coup leader to step aside and restore democracy. “Any time you can avoid military conflict you score that as a win,” Balmer said. Four years earlier, for the benefit of Republican President George H.W. Bush and the lives at stake in the region, Carter secured peace in Nicaragua at the brink of bloodshed when he persuaded the leftist leader Daniel Ortega to accept the electoral defeat that had so shocked the Sandinistas. John Danforth, former Republican senator from Missouri, joined Carter on missions to lay the groundwork for the 1990 Nicaragua election and then monitor it. In the first, the Carter entourage came upon Ortega's motorcade on a dusty road through the town of Rivas. The two men retired to the backyard of the nearest house for an impromptu negotiation over the government trucks Carter wanted Ortega to send around the country to deliver election material. “Often when we envision former presidents, the picture is distant, even stuffy: men in dark suits and neckties captured in formal poses as though engaged in deep thoughts,” Danforth wrote in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in February 2023. ""My picture of Carter is quite the contrary. He is in a back yard in Rivas. A crowing rooster is at his feet. An earnest expression is on his face. He’s not talking statecraft; he’s talking trucks.” He could drive successors crazy Yet he could infuriate those in power. Years after the U.S.-led Gulf War rolled back Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait, it emerged that Carter had lobbied U.N. Security Council members and foreign leaders to reject the elder Bush’s request to authorize the use of force. After being mostly sidelined by the man who defeated him in 1980, Ronald Reagan, Carter was given several missions by Bush until the Gulf War episode, after which he was cut off, Gibbs and Duffy write. His relationship with Clinton was limited and uneasy, bookended by Clinton’s reluctance to call on a figure who symbolized humiliating election defeat for Democrats and by Carter’s disapproval of Clinton’s behavior outside his marriage. But after Clinton won the White House in 1992, he sent Carter to North Korea to take the measure of dictator Kim Il Sung. Clinton aides were livid when Carter went beyond his brief, engaging in an unauthorized negotiation with Kim and, what’s more, talking about it on TV. But then, Carter was always a step apart from the rest. He was also one to wag a finger at the political establishment, if not to pulverize it like Donald Trump did. In January 2009, President George W. Bush invited other members of the presidents club to the White House for lunch and Oval Office photos. Bush, his father, Clinton and President-elect Barack Obama are seen clustered in front of the Resolute Desk. Carter is conspicuously off to the side — outlying. The images spoke volumes about Carter’s place in the club, Balmer said. “Jimmy Carter didn’t fit in with a lot of people. He was really an introvert, not somebody who warms up easily.” If politics makes strange bedfellows, though, post-politics makes even stranger ones. The embedded hostilities of Democrat-versus-Republican can melt in the presidents club as former rivals become unlikely mates. Except with Trump. Regardless of party, the club members disdained Trump in his first term, and he had no use for them. When Carter turned 100 in October, Trump marked the occasion by declaring that Joe Biden is so bad a president that Carter must be “the happiest man because Carter is considered a brilliant president by comparison.” Trump was more sober in response to Carter's death, saying “the challenges Jimmy faced as president came at a pivotal time for our country and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans. For that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude.” Political foes found common ground Democrat Lyndon Johnson leaned frequently on Republican predecessor Dwight Eisenhower, telling him “You’re the best chief of staff I’ve got.” On the night of John Kennedy’s assassination, LBJ sought Ike’s advice on what to say to Congress, adding: “I need you more than ever now.” Reagan once pulled Clinton aside to tell him the military salute he was executing during the campaign was too lame for the presidency. He taught him how to make it snappy. Clinton in turn cherished his long and frequent phone calls with Richard Nixon, confiding in the disgraced but savvy Republican on foreign policy problems of the era. Clinton also became close to the Republican he vanquished in 1992, joining the elder Bush in Maine for golf, zippy boat rides and nights by the sea. More consequentially, the younger Bush asked his dad and Clinton to lead a fundraising mission for countries devastated by the 2004 tsunami, giving rise to a bipartisan pairing that pitched in on more endeavors, like Hurricane Katrina relief. “I just loved him,” Clinton said upon Bush’s death in 2018. So, too, Obama and the younger Bush have teamed up on occasion and Bush enjoys an especially good-natured relationship with Michelle Obama. The singular friendship of Carter and Ford But the Jimmy-Jerry friendship was one for the ages. Carter took it as a point of pride when two historians, speaking separately at a commemoration of the 200th birthday of the White House, said his friendship with Ford was the most intensely personal between any two presidents in history. Carter said it began in 1981, when the two were sent by Reagan to represent the U.S. at the funeral of Anwar Sadat, the assassinated Egyptian leader. Nixon was on the trip, too, somewhat awkwardly. The other two took to each other, commiserating over how tough it could be to raise money for a presidential library when you’ve been booted out of office. They were both Navy men, had three sons, a strong religious faith that Ford was quieter about than Carter, and independent spouses who bonded as well. “The four of us learned to love each other,” Carter said. Carter and Ford spoke regularly, teamed up as co-leaders on dozens of projects and decided together which events they’d attend and skip in tandem. “When we were traveling somewhere in an automobile or airplane, we hated to reach our destination, because we enjoyed the private times that we had together,” Carter said. That’s what he told mourners in January 2007, at a service for Ford the month after he died at age 93. The Democrat and the Republican he so cherished had made a pact, one hard to imagine in this time of partisan poison: Whoever died first would be eulogized by the other.",380,[],2025-01-06 19:28:40,2025-01-07 00:17:41

In recent months, the key adviser to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly posted attacks on social media of British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his center-left Labour Party, which was elected in July. Most recently, the South African-born U.S. businessman has focused on child sexual abuse and the U.K. government’s handling of investigations into organized gangs that allegedly oversaw the systematic rape of young women. The Tesla CEO has also pushed the “two-tier policing” conspiracy theory, claiming British officials treat pro-Palestinian or Black Lives Matter demonstrators more leniently than far-right protesters. Musk’s fascination with the U.K. was reportedly set to extend to making a substantial donation to Reform U.K., the growing right-wing party. But that now looks in doubt after Musk on Sunday said leader Nigel Farage “doesn’t have what it takes.” His interest in British politics continued Monday, when he posted an online poll on his X social media site that posed the proposition: “America should liberate the people of Britain from their tyrannical government.” In his attacks on the U.K. government, Musk has called for the jailing of Jess Phillips, a junior government minister responsible for combating violence against women and girls. He called her a “rape genocide apologist.” That comment came after Phillips reportedlyrejected calls for a public inquiry into historic child abuse in the northern English town of Oldham and said such a decision was up to the local authorities. Musk also has criticized Starmer for failing to bring perpetrators to justice when he was England’s director of public prosecutions between 2008 and 2013. The previous Conservative government held an inquiry into historic child sex abuse cases, though many of the recommendations it made in 2022 have yet to be implemented. Musk’s fallout with Farage — the political leader had described Musk as “a hero” — stems from the Reform U.K. leader distancing himself from jailed far-right activist Tommy Robinson. Musk has said Robinson should be released from prison. On Monday, Starmer responded to Musk’s attacks, condemning “those that are spreading lies and misinformation as far and as wide as possible.” The prime minister defended his record as chief prosecutor, saying he had reopened closed cases and “changed the whole prosecution approach” to child sexual exploitation. He also slammed the language used by Musk about Phillips. “When the poison of the far-right leads to serious threats to Jess Phillips and others, then in my book, a line has been crossed,” Starmer said. The billionaire’s remarks on Britain underline his increased interest in politics across the world after helping bankroll Trump’s imminent return to the White House. Musk has also weighed in on German politics recently by endorsing the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.

Former Sgt. Aquilino Gonell, who left the police force in 2022 due to the mental and physical damage he sustained on Jan. 6, 2021, recalled, “I thought I was going to die and never make it home to see my wife and young son” in the article published Sunday, the eve of the anniversary. “Over the last four years, it’s been devastating to me to hear Donald Trump repeat his promise to pardon insurrectionists on the first day he’s back in office,” he wrote, noting that Trump has referred to those convicted as “hostages” and “peaceful protesters.” “But all of us who were there and anyone who watched on TV know that those who stormed the Capitol were not peaceful protesters,” Gonnell said. “Pardoning them would be an outrageous mistake, one that could mean about 800 convicted criminals will be back on the street.” Gonnell also said pardons could endanger him, “as I’ve continued to testify in court and I’ve given victim statements in cases against dozens of the rioters who assaulted me and my fellow officers.” Gonell and other ex-law enforcement officers — such as Harry Dunn and Michael Fanone — who have spoken out about the violence they survived have faced vitriol and hate from election deniers and Trump supporters as the president-elect and his allies whitewash the events of Jan. 6. More than 1,500 people were criminally charged in connection to the riot at the Capitol in which more than 140 police officers were assaulted. It is estimated that the attack caused millions of dollars in damage. A recent HuffPost analysis found that the majority of people who are still incarcerated over Jan. 6 are those who attacked police, possessed weapons or explosives, or committed other violent felonies. “Releasing those who assaulted us from blame would be a desecration of justice,” Gonell wrote. “If Mr. Trump wants to heal our divided nation, he’ll let their convictions stand.” He slammed the “ongoing whitewashing” and “collective amnesia of right-wing politicians who aren’t willing to hold Mr. Trump accountable.” “Mr. Trump is returning to the presidency at 78, while I had to leave the career I’d worked for my whole life at 42 as a result of injuries suffered while doing my job,” Gonnell added. “I sometimes wonder why I risked my life to defend our elected officials from a mob inspired by Mr. Trump, only to see him return to power stronger than ever. It’s hard to witness a rich white man get rewarded for treachery while I’m punished for fulfilling my duty.” Congress meets on Monday to certify Trump’s election victory four years after a mob of his supporters laid siege to the Capitol in an attempt to halt that process for President Joe Biden’s 2020 win.

U.S. Steel and Japan's Nippon Steel said in a release Monday that President Joe Biden ""ignored the rule of law"" in order to gain favor with United Steelworkers, the union representing many of U.S. Steel's employees, when he announced Friday he would not allow the acquisition to go through. Separately, U.S. Steel and Nippon said they were also suing the president of the union, David McCall; as well as the head of an Ohio-based rival mining firm, Cleveland-Cliffs, accusing them of illegally coordinating to undermine the transaction. Nippon Steel had proposed a $14 billion deal to buy U.S. Steel, but the agreement, which U.S. Steel executives favored, became mired in a national security review by a Treasury Department committee that assesses foreign ownership proposals. Ultimately, that committee failed to agree on whether Nippon ownership posed a security risk., and asked Biden for a final decision. In announcing his veto of the deal, Biden said shifting the firm out of American hands would undermine critical supply chains and put jobs at risk. The Treasury committee, as well as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Attorney General Merrick Garland, are also named in the suit. “A committee of national security and trade experts determined this acquisition would create risk for American national security,"" a Biden administration spokesperson said in an emailed statement. ""President Biden will never hesitate to protect the security of this nation, its infrastructure, and the resilience of its supply chains."" McCall, the steelworkers union boss, said in a statement that he was reviewing the suit. ""By blocking Nippon Steel’s attempt to acquire U.S. Steel, the Biden administration protected vital U.S. interests, safeguarded our national security and helped preserve a domestic steel industry that underpins our country’s critical supply chains,"" he said. A Cleveland-Cliffs representative did not respond to a request for comment. Following the announcement of the suits Monday, President-elect Donald Trump, who had expressed opposition to the Nippon deal while campaigning last year, posted to social media about the situation. “Why would they want to sell U.S. Steel now when Tariffs will make it a much more profitable and valuable company,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform. “Wouldn’t it be nice to have U.S. Steel, once the greatest company in the World, lead the charge toward greatness again?

Bratt, 65, played a pivotal role in the investigation into sensitive national security documents that Trump took to his Mar-a-Lago residence and social club following the end of his first term as president in 2021. Bratt was not immediately available for comment. His departure was previously reported by the website SpyTalk. The investigation led to a court-approved FBI search of the Florida club in August 2022 that turned up about 100 classified documents and enraged Trump and his supporters. Bratt joined Smith's office when the special counsel took over the investigation and helped secure an indictment accusing Trump of knowingly keeping the documents and obstructing U.S. government attempts to retrieve them. Trump pleaded not guilty and argued that the case, and other criminal cases against him, were politically motivated attempts to damage him and his political movement. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump nominee, dismissed all charges in July 2024 after finding that Smith was improperly appointed as special counsel. Prosecutors had appealed the ruling, but dropped their bid with respect to Trump after his election win. They signaled that they will seek to revive the case against two Trump associates, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, who were accused of obstructing the probe. Bratt and others in Smith's office formally handed the appeal to federal prosecutors in south Florida late last month. Bratt was the subject of a misconduct complaint brought by a lawyer defending Nauta, Stanley Woodward, as part of a bid to dismiss the charges. Woodward accused Bratt of raising his pending application to be a local judge in Washington, D.C., during a 2022 meeting, part of what Woodward claimed was an attempt to coerce Nauta to cooperate with the government. Prosecutors denied anything improper occurred and said that Bratt raised Woodward's application as a professional courtesy, according to court documents. Bratt spent decades in the Justice Department and most recently led a section focused on counterintelligence and export control cases.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/supporters-impeached-south-korean-president-145341770.html,Supporters of impeached South Korean president find inspiration in Trump,,World,NBC News,5 min read,Supporters of impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol have adopted some of the symbols and slogans associated with President-elect Donald Trump.,Stella Kim,2025-01-06T14:53:41.000Z,"SEOUL, South Korea — In some ways it is a familiar scene: American flags, “Stop the Steal” posters and the occasional hat declaring “Make America Great Again.” It isn’t a Donald Trump rally, however, but a protest by conservative supporters of impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, who could become the East Asian democracy’s first sitting president to be arrested after he plunged it into political instability last month with his botched attempt to declare martial law. Though opinion polls suggest the majority of South Koreans support removing Yoon from office, his impeachment and potential arrest have brought backlash from members of his base, some of whom have amplified claims of election fraud and other conspiracy theories promoted by right-wing YouTubers. Many of Yoon’s supporters wave American flags to express support for the longtime South Korean alliance with the United States, whose backing they see as crucial for protecting South Korean democracy in a hostile neighborhood. They have also adopted some of the symbols and slogans associated with President-elect Trump, whom they see as a political kindred spirit to Yoon and one who is similarly persecuted. “South Koreans, particularly conservatives, see parallels between Trump’s ‘Make America Great Again’ slogan and their own aspirations for a ‘Great Korea,’” Choi Jin Nyoung, a commentator and lawyer in Seoul, told NBC News on Monday. “They view Trump’s agenda as aligning with their desire to restore national pride and progress, especially after what they perceive as political and diplomatic setbacks during previous administrations.” Yoon supporters cheered on Friday when officials failed to execute an arrest warrant for Yoon at his official residence in central Seoul after an hourslong standoff with his security service. Thousands of pro-Yoon protesters had gathered outside the residence in recent days to “protect” him from being arrested. Many of them dismissed the investigations against Yoon as politically motivated, echoing accusations by Trump supporters. “These actions were carried out as an overreach from the start, and the investigations were initiated unlawfully,” Gang Sung-min, a pro-Yoon protester, said Friday. “So I believe that the people can step in to block such illegal acts.” Investigators are seeking to question Yoon on possible rebellion charges in connection with his Dec. 3 martial law order, which he lifted hours later after lawmakers voted unanimously to reject it. Warrants issued last week to detain Yoon and search his residence were set to expire at midnight local time, and the anti-corruption agency leading the joint investigation was said to be seeking an extension. Yoon, who narrowly won election to a single five-year term in 2022, has struggled to advance his legislative agenda against the opposition-controlled parliament. In a surprise late-night address last month, he said martial law was necessary to combat “anti-state” forces he accused of paralyzing the government and sympathizing with communist North Korea, with which the South technically remains at war. He has also said the April parliamentary election, which the main opposition Democratic Party won in a landslide, was fraudulent, a claim for which there is no evidence. During his martial law declaration, Yoon sent troops to the National Election Commission headquarters to investigate his allegations, though the order was lifted before they were able to seize any computer equipment or personnel. Though Yoon provided no evidence for his accusations, they resonated with his supporters, many of whom are older, Christian conservatives whose families fled what is now North Korea decades ago and who support Yoon’s hard line on the nuclear-armed state. They are also deeply suspicious of communist-ruled China, and see both Yoon and Trump as tough on Beijing. The liberal Democratic Party, which controls the legislature and could win back the presidency if a new election is held, is perceived as more open to engagement with both China and North Korea. “If impeachment proceeds and the current administration collapses, many conservatives fear that this could lead to not just a change in leadership but a national crisis,” Chung Hyuk Jin, a moderate commentator, told NBC News by phone on Monday. Yoon supporters have accused China without evidence of driving the anti-Yoon protests. They have also embraced Yoon’s false claims of election fraud as well as Trump’s. “South Korea, like the United States, is being destroyed by electoral fraud. It is collapsing,” said Ahn Jae-eun, 63, whose parents fled to South Korea during the 1950-53 Korean War. Ahn said Yoon had declared martial law “in his efforts to uncover the truth about this electoral fraud,” and that his impeachment was illegal and South Korean media was spreading “fake news.” “When our President Trump takes office on January 20, together with President Yoon Suk Yeol, the truth about these electoral frauds will be fully uncovered,” she said. Even Yoon’s own lawyers have referred to Trump in their legal filings, citing last summer’s Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity to argue that Yoon was exercising his executive authority and that there was no violation of fundamental rights during the short-lived martial law order. “The repeal request was made, the president accepted it, and the troops were immediately withdrawn, right? So there was no specific harm or damage done,” one of Yoon’s lawyers, Bae Bo-yoon, said Friday. Stella Kim reported from Seoul, South Korea, and Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong.

Republicans remain in control, but their majority is at its narrowest since they took over in 2011.",TODD RICHMOND and SCOTT BAUER,2025-01-06T20:27:50.000Z,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers' plan to let voters repeal and create state laws without legislative involvement met opposition on Monday from Republican leaders of the Legislature, who signaled that the idea is likely to be rejected for a second time. Evers' plan comes the same day the Legislature kicked off its two-year session. Republicans remain in control, but their majority is at its narrowest since they took over in 2011. That means the dynamic between the Legislature and Evers, entering his seventh year as governor, will largely remain as it has been. Republicans must approve anything Evers wants to get done. Still, the Democratic Evers is reviving a plan previously rejected by Republicans giving voters the power to enact laws without approval of the Legislature. Evers said on Friday that the state budget he plans to unveil next month will include a mandate that legislators take up a constitutional amendment allowing voters to petition for ballot proposals to repeal state statutes and create new ones. Evers made a similar proposal in 2022 for voters to repeal the state’s 1849 abortion ban, but Republicans killed the plan. Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos rejected the idea. “It appears that Tony Evers' single agenda item for the next session to is take power away from the elected members of the Legislature,” Vos told The Associated Press. “If that's his focus, it's going to make it awfully hard to find consensus.” Republican Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu said in a statement that Evers should focus on cutting taxes and scaling back the size of government. Republicans hold a 54-45 advantage in the Assembly and an 18-15 majority in the Senate in the two-year session that started Monday. There are six new state senators, all Democrats. Nearly a third of the Assembly — 31 lawmakers — are newly elected. Of them, 23 are Democrats. Those new lawmakers make up the majority of the 45-member Democratic caucus. Lawmakers have said they are hopeful the slimmer GOP majorities will lead to more compromise, but on this issue they don't appear to be willing to go along with what Evers wants. Wisconsin is one of 24 states that do not provide a way for people to reject or enact statutes outside of the legislative process, according to Ballotpedia. Evers said Republicans have been ignoring the will of the people by refusing to legalize marijuana, repeal the abortion ban, implement gun control measures and increase funding for public schools. Instead, he said, the GOP has been enacting policy through constitutional amendments, denying voters a voice. “Republican lawmakers are going to continue to try to legislate by constitutional amendment,” Evers said. “Then they should give Wisconsinites the same opportunity that 26 other states have.” Constitutional amendments must pass two consecutive legislative sessions and a statewide referendum to take effect. The governor plays no role in the process. Republicans have asked voters to approve seven amendments since 2010, according to data from the University of Wisconsin Law School’s State Democracy Research Initiative. Voters ratified three in 2024 alone, including two in April to restrict use of private money in election administration and one in November that prohibits foreign nationals from voting. Republicans plan to give final passage this month to another amendment that would put the state's voter ID requirement in the constitution, rather than just state law. The Senate is expected to pass it this week, followed by the Assembly next week, which would then put the question on the April election ballot. Gun control advocates gathered in the Capitol on Monday shortly before the session kicked off to press lawmakers to take action following a shooting by a 15-year-old student on Dec. 16 at a Madison private school that left a teacher and student dead and two other students severely injured. The shooter killed herself. Evers called a special session in 2019 in an attempt to pass gun control measures, including requiring universal background checks, but Republicans took no action. Evers also called a special legislative session in September 2022 to approve a constitutional amendment similar to his latest proposal. He promoted it as a way to repeal the abortion ban and ensure abortion remained legal in Wisconsin after the U.S. Supreme Court reversed its landmark Roe v. Wade decision. Republicans convened and ending the special session in less than 30 seconds.",65,[],2025-01-06 19:29:33,2025-01-07 00:19:42

Trudeau will stay on as Canada's prime minister until the Liberals appoint a new leader. ""I intend to resign as party leader, as prime minister after the party selects its next leader through a robust nationwide competitive process,"" said Trudeau. ""Last night, I asked the president of the Liberal Party to begin that process. This country deserves a real choice in the next election, and it has become clear to me that if I am having to fight internal battles I cannot be the best option in that election."" Trudeau has faced increased scrutiny ever since former finance minister Chrystia Freeland resigned in December, as she wrote a letter calling out Trudeau's ""political gimmicks"" in the face of Donald Trump's tariff threats. Calls for Trudeau to resign have grown among MPs of all parties, including the Liberals. The prime minister’s resignation comes at a bad time for the Liberals, with polls showing that the party would lose to Pierre Poilievre's Conservatives. The next federal election must take place on or before Oct. 20, 2025. For updates, analysis, reaction and press conferences, follow along with Yahoo News Canada's live blog. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre says Justin Trudeau's announcement that he will resign does not change the outlook for the Liberal Party of Canada. ""Canadians desperate to turn the page on this dark chapter in our history might be relieved today that Justin Trudeau is finally leaving. But what has really changed?"" Polievere asked. ""Every Liberal MP in power today and every potential Liberal leadership contender fighting for the top job helped Justin Trudeau break the country over the last nine years."" Nothing has changed. Every Liberal MP and Leadership contender supported EVERYTHING Trudeau did for 9 years, and now they want to trick voters by swapping in another Liberal face to keep ripping off Canadians for another 4 years, just like Justin.The only way to fix what… pic.twitter.com/YnNYANTs1y — Pierre Poilievre (@PierrePoilievre) January 6, 2025 Polievere cited the carbon tax, government spending, as well the Liberals' immigration, housing and crime policies. ""Their only objection is that [Trudeau] is no longer popular enough to win an election and keep them in power,"" Poilievre said. ""They want to protect their pensions and paycheques by sweeping their hated leader under the rug months before an election, to trick you and then do it all over again."" Trudeau has faced increased pressure to step down since his former finance minister Chrystia Freeland resigned on Dec. 16 in a letter to the prime minister. Initially, Trudeau had asked Freeland to step down from the post of finance minister for another position in his cabinet. Instead, Freeland decided to leave altogether, citing that she could not do her job while having a lack of ""confidence"" from the PM. Some view Freeland's resignation, and her scathing letter, as the ""catalyst"" to what led to Trudeau's decision on Monday. When asked to comment on his side of what happened, Trudeau said he isn't ""someone who's in the habit of sharing private conversations."" ""Chrystia has been by my side for close to 10 years now,"" Trudeau said. ""She has been an incredible political partner through just about everything we have done as a government and as a party over the past decade I had really hoped that she would agree to continue as my deputy prime minister and take on one of the most important files that not just this government but this country is facing, but she chose otherwise."" On Monday, Trudeau was asked how the Liberals can be in a position to protect Canadian businesses from the threat of Donald Trump's tariffs, as the party looks to appoint a new leader in the next two months. Trudeau's resignation comes just two weeks before U.S.-President-elect Donald Trump gets sworn into office.Since his election win in November 2024, Trump has repeatedly made threats that the U.S. will impose high tariffs on Canadian goods. ""The Cabinet will still be very much focused on doing the job that Canadians elected us to do in 2021, which is fight for their interests, stand up for their well being, and make sure that they are good and that Canadians are protected and strong. ""There will be a leadership process and the rules will unfold over the coming weeks, but I can assure you that the tools and the need to stand up for Canadians, to protect Canadians and their interests and continue to fight for the economy is something that everyone in this government will be singularly focused on."" With all eyes on Justin Trudeau, the prime minister stepped out at his residence, Rideau Cottage in Ottawa, to announce his decision to step down as the Liberal leader. When Parliament resumes March 24, it's expected that calls for a non-confidence vote will continue. If that vote takes place and the government fails, then an election will be triggered. This will put the new Liberal leader front and centre in the race against the Conservatives and Pierre Poilievre, who are favoured to win the election according to polls. Trudeau believes that stepping down gives his party a better chance. ""There is always going to be the challenge of having a leadership race while a Parliament would face confidence votes in the course of delivering supply to the government,"" Trudeau said. ""So this is something that we're going to navigate through. But I truly feel that removing the contention around my own continued leadership is an opportunity to bring the temperature down, have a government that will focus on the complex issues that are coming forward in the coming months, while the party gets to have a full national process that brings in people from right across the country and makes a determination about the best person to carry the progressive, Liberal standard into the next election."" With Trudeau's granted request to prorogue Parliament, it stops MPs from being able to pass a non-confidence vote, which would trigger a federal election. The Conservatives have tabled many motions seeking a non-confidence vote against Trudeau and the Liberals since fall 2024. Following Freeland's resignation, Jagmeet Singh and the NDP said they would join the Conservatives in passing a non-confidence vote. On Monday, Trudeau defended his decision to prorogue Parliament, saying that it's ""time for a reset."" ""Anyone who's been watching politics closely over the past months will know that Parliament has been entirely seized by obstruction and filibustering and a total lack of productivity. ""It's time for the temperature to come down, for the people to have a fresh start in Parliament, to be able to navigate through these complex times, both domestically and internationally. And the reset that we have is actually two parts. One is the prorogation, but the other part is recognizing that removing me from the equation as the leader who will fight the next election for the Liberal Party should also decrease the level of polarization that we're seeing right now in the House and in Canadian politics, and allow people to actually focus on serving Canadians in this House and with their work the way Canadians deserve."" Trudeau “absolutely” believes that there is another Liberal leader who can defeat Pierre Poilievre’s Conservatives in an upcoming federal election. Before giving his answer, the PM took time to remind Canadians of who he believes Poilievre truly is. “Poilievre’s vision for this country is not the right one for Canadians,” Trudeau said. “Stopping the fight against climate change doesn't make sense. Backing off on the values and strength and diversity that Canada has always worked to pull itself together on, is not the right path for the country. Attacking journalists, the CBC institutions, that's not what Canadians need in this moment. ""We need an ambitious, optimistic view of the future, and Pierre Poilievre is not offering that, and I look forward to the fight as progressives across this country stand up for the kind of vision for a better country that Canadians have always carried despite the tremendous pressures around the world to think smaller, to veer towards the far right and to be less ambitious for what we can be and do as a country when the world really needs Canada.” Justin Trudeau has requested that Parliament be prorogued, which Governor General Mary Simon has granted until March 24. ""Parliament has been paralyzed for months after what has been the longest session of a minority Parliament in Canadian history,"" Trudeau said at his press conference on Monday. Justin Trudeau says he will step down as prime minister and leader of the Liberal Party of Canada after a new leader has been selected. He made the statement Monday morning at Rideau Cottage. It remains unclear if Justin Trudeau will stay on as prime minister, even after stepping down as the Liberal leader. He could wait until a new party leader is selected. According to The Globe, the Liberal Party national executive plans to meet next week, likely after Wednesday's national caucus session, where they will make their leadership decision. The Liberals can either appoint an interim leader or hold a shortened leadership contest. In the event that they choose the latter, it wold require the Governor-General Mary Simon to prorogue Parliament, which isn't a guarantee. The prime minister will hold an announcement at 10:45 a.m. ET at Rideau Cottage on Monday morning. CBC and the Toronto Star are reporting that Justin Trudeau will use this opportunity to formally announce his resignation. Yahoo News Canada will have the live feed as part of this article, so be sure to check back in.

https://sports.yahoo.com/all-49-possible-super-bowl-matchups-ranked-145903809.html,"All 49 possible Super Bowl matchups, ranked",,Sports,Yahoo Sports,11 min read,"Some Super Bowl matchups are atrocious and unthinkable, some are transcendent and we should only get so lucky.",jay busbee,2025-01-06T15:00:00.000Z,"The playoff fields are set, and with seven teams from each conference advancing, that means there are 49 possible combinations for Super Bowl LIX. Some are atrocious and unthinkable, some are transcendent and we should only get so lucky. At the moment, all are equally possible — theoretically, at least. We’ve ranked them based on watchability, narrative, stars and general gut feelings. Here we go: 49. Packers vs. Chargers: Look, even the worst Super Bowl matchup is still pretty good. It’s the last NFL football we’ll see until August. And you can always watch for the commercials. 48. Rams vs. Texans: C.J. Stroud has regressed a bit to the mean this season, but you know that he’s going to take a team to the Super Bowl eventually. Texans fans just have to hope it’s while he’s still in a Houston uniform. 47. Buccaneers vs. Broncos: No team played more playoff teams in the regular season than Tampa Bay. The Bucs went 1-3 against the AFC’s best, which is either a sign that they’re in trouble or that they got tough. Denver beat Tampa Bay 26-7 in Week 3. 46. Commanders vs. Steelers: Pittsburgh won this game in the regular season, 28-27 in Week 10. That started a three-game losing streak that nearly submarined Washington’s season. Washington has gotten better since then. Pittsburgh has not. 45. Buccaneers vs. Chargers: Tampa Bay demolished the Chargers in Week 15, 40-17, the fourth of four consecutive victories that helped the Bucs overtake the Falcons for the NFC South lead. What did Jim Harbaugh learn from that loss? We’ll find out. 44. Rams vs. Broncos: Bo Nix in the Super Bowl is something I don’t think the world is quite prepared to handle. But get ready, it’s coming. 43. Buccaneers vs. Texans: Baker Mayfield is tougher than three-dollar steak and hangs around just as long. He might just be the Comeback Player of the Decade. Fifty years from now, he’ll still be playing, and still be getting written off and disregarded up until he throws himself into a 400-pound lineman while going for a first down. 42. Commanders vs. Broncos: Back in Super Bowl XXII, Washington annihilated Denver, 42-10. They probably should’ve saved a few of those points for use this year. 41. Rams vs. Chargers: An interesting thought experiment: What if the Rams and Chargers both made it to the conference championships and hosted? Yes, it would require an array of upsets, given that they’re seeded 4th and 5th, respectively, but it could happen. So what then? Do they play both games on the same field, on the same day? Do the visiting teams have to share a locker room? Would that not be the greatest day of live football you could possibly see? 40. Packers vs. Steelers: Given these two teams’ illustrious history, this ought to be a lot more of a marquee matchup than it is, in their current states. Sure, they’re both in the playoffs, but that’s pretty much the bare minimum we expect out of these two franchises. This would be a rematch of Super Bowl XLV, a.k.a. Aaron Rodgers’ only Super Bowl. 39. Lions vs. Texans: A rematch of a Week 10 game, where Houston had a 23-7 lead at halftime … and then never scored again, losing 26-23. If that happened in the Super Bowl, Houstonians would tear down the Astrodome by hand. 38. Buccaneers vs. Steelers: It would be just like Russell Wilson to prove all the haters wrong by winning another Super Bowl a decade after his first … and then proving all the haters right by turning the postgame celebration into a choreographed combination Taco Bell/crypto commercial. 37. Rams vs. Ravens: Watching Sean McVay and John Harbaugh work is like watching LeBron vs. Anthony Edwards — or if you prefer, Jordan vs. Iverson. Two greats from two different generations throwing down. It may not be pretty, but it’s fascinating. 36. Vikings vs. Broncos: We’ve all been waiting for Sam Darnold to show his inner Sam Darnoldness, but what if Good Sam was the real Sam all along? (He spent time on the Jets and Panthers, so this is entirely possible.) 35. Commanders vs. Texans: Washington tends to have some trouble with Texas-based, Cowboy-oriented teams. “Battle of the No. 2s” doesn’t quite have that championship ring to it, does it? 34. Packers vs. Ravens: Packers fans are living under some kind of bizarre witch’s curse where they’ve had a franchise quarterback for 30-plus unbroken years, but he’ll only win you one Super Bowl. The Ravens, by contrast, are guaranteed a Super Bowl every 12 years, so … heads up. 33. Rams vs. Steelers: A rematch of Super Bowl XIV, won by the Steelers. I feel confident in saying that monstrous Steelers team could at least make the divisional round of the playoffs today. Like, literally right now. 32. Eagles vs. Broncos: Did you know that only the Patriots have been to more Super Bowls than Denver? Three other teams can match Denver’s eight … just don’t ask Broncos fans how those eight turned out. Especially the first few. 31. Packers vs. Texans: One of the better midseason games, a Week 7 tilt where the two teams traded would-be game-winning field goals. Green Bay ended up on top with a 0:00-clock winner. That would be a welcome outcome to a Super Bowl. 30. Packers vs. Broncos: A rematch of Super Bowl XXXII, the one where John Elway finally got that ring, and Brett Favre did not. Keep an eye on Favre, he might try to un-retire again and take Jordan Love’s job. 29. Commanders vs. Chargers: If Justin Herbert is going to level up beyond “dude you can ride to the fantasy playoffs,” he’ll need to win big opportunities like this. 28. Vikings vs. Texans: A rematch of Week 3, where the Vikings obliterated the Texans 34-7. This was the point in 2024 where we started to think that maybe Darnold had a little something going here. 27. Lions vs. Steelers: Rust Belt Brawl! This one wouldn’t be pretty, but it’d be a battle of America’s newest sweetheart vs. America’s longtime bandwagon. Edge: the sweethearts. 26. Packers vs. Chiefs: Rematch of Super Bowl I, which was so long ago that it wasn’t even called the “Super Bowl.” You probably should’ve bought an NFL franchise back then, they were going for like 50 bucks. 25. Eagles vs. Texans: Philly is 1-3 all-time in Super Bowls. Seems like they ought to have more Lombardis than that. This would give the Iggles a good chance at drawing closer to .500. 24. Vikings vs. Steelers: These two met in Super Bowl IX, which, coincidentally enough, was also in New Orleans. Not so coincidentally, Minnesota lost this one; this was the start of Pittsburgh’s Steel Curtain run. 23. Packers vs. Bills: We need to see Josh Allen do something absolutely ridiculous in the Super Bowl, like throw a defensive end into the stands or step on a linebacker’s chest or throw a bank-shot touchdown pass off someone’s helmet. America needs you, Josh Allen. 22. Buccaneers vs. Ravens: The Josh Allen/Lamar Jackson MVP debate is fun only as long as it focuses on on-field attributes; when everybody brings their petty biases into play, it gets ugly. Both of them are on Hall of Fame trajectories. 21. Lions vs. Broncos: Jared Goff really needs a better performance in the Super Bowl than he showed against the Patriots as a member of the Rams a few years back. Against Denver, he’d get it. 20. Commanders vs. Ravens: The Battle of I-95. Loser has to commute to the other’s town in rush hour for a month. Baltimore won the Week 6 matchup, 30-23. 19. Vikings vs. Chargers: These two teams specialize in disappointing their fans, one way or another. Will Chargering outdo a Vikings Curse? Or will they figure a way to both lose? 18. Vikings vs. Ravens: The Vikings defense and Lamar Jackson are a classic immovable object vs. irresistible force. This would be a hammer-on-anvil attack. 17. Eagles vs. Steelers: The Battle of Interstate 76! At stake: cheesesteaks vs. Primanti’s subs. Winner replaces turkey at Thanksgiving. Loser can’t be served in the state for a year. The Eagles got the W in Week 15, 27-13. 16. Commanders vs. Bills: You think that if the Commanders reach the Super Bowl, anyone will mention what happened to Dan Quinn the last time he was there? Or to the Bills, the last four times they were there? 15, Lions vs. Chargers: Look, how can you not like the matchup of the two most psychotic coaches in the NFL? A Dan Campbell-Jim Harbaugh joint press conference could be its own pay-per-view. 14. Eagles vs. Chargers: Don’t look now, but the Chargers are becoming a sneaky interesting team, between their coach, their quarterback’s skills and their venue. They’re still the Clippers to the Rams’ Lakers, but a Super Bowl win would go a long way toward changing that perception. 13. Buccaneers vs. Chiefs: Tom Brady was on the field the last time these two met in a Super Bowl, back in Super Bowl LV, and he’ll be in the booth for this one. But you know he’s just itching to get back out there. 12. Eagles vs. Ravens: Saquon Barkley vs. the NFL’s top rush defense? Yep, sign us up for that one. It won’t be cinematic, but that’s what the commercials are for. Philly won the Week 13 matchup, 24-19. 11. Commanders vs. Chiefs: Who ranks higher, a commander or a chief? Who’s more fun to watch, Jayden Daniels or Patrick Mahomes? 10. Buccaneers vs. Bills: The Bucs have been a mystery all season — dominant some weeks, barely good enough to win others, but always somehow in the hunt. This would be a fine matchup because the Bills would post a four-touchdown lead and watch in horror as Tampa Bay crawled back into the game. 9. Rams vs. Chiefs: The two teams responsible for one of the greatest regular-season games of all time? Sure, that’ll work. 8. Lions vs. Ravens: This would be a ground-game Super Bowl for the ages. Sonic & Knuckles (maybe) vs. King Henry. Who ya got? 7. Eagles vs. Chiefs: A rematch of Super Bowl LVII a couple years back, where Philly led going into the 4th quarter, but — stop us if you’ve heard this one before — Patrick Mahomes led the Chiefs to victory. 6. Rams vs. Bills: The two teams responsible for one of the great points-scoring shootouts of the 2024 season? Sure, that’ll work too. 5. Vikings vs. Chiefs: A rematch of Super Bowl IV, which Kansas City won 23-7. They ought to play this one with 1970s equipment and under 1970s officiating rules, just to see who’s really the toughest. 4. Eagles vs. Bills: This game needs to be played in the snow. That will be a difficult task to pull off in a dome in New Orleans, but I have faith in the NFL. 3. Lions vs. Chiefs: Admit it, you want to see what kinds of trick plays Andy Reid and Dan Campbell cook up for this one. We could see everything from the ol’ hidden-ball trick to full-scale Broadway productions in the backfield. 2. Vikings vs. Bills: Eight combined Super Bowl appearances, zero wins. Somebody’s got to end their streak of 0-4 futility here, right? Bonus: These are two talented squads, and this would be a fantastic game. 1. Lions vs. Bills: Call it the Validation Bowl, call it the Long-Suffering Bowl, call it the At-Freaking-Last Bowl. Whatever you want to call it, this is absolutely the best possible Super Bowl matchup, from both an on-field and narrative standpoint. Bring it.",111,[],2025-01-06 19:31:18,2025-01-09 00:33:17

Here's who they chose.,Elizabeth Di Filippo·Lifestyle & Features Editor,2025-01-06T18:54:45.000Z,"The 2025 Golden Globes may be over, but there's still two awards left to present: best and worst dressed. The 82nd Golden Globes Awards celebrated a year of standout filmmaking and can't-miss television with A-list stars like Nicole Kidman, Demi Moore and Zendaya hitting the red carpet in all their finery. While the red carpet was mostly a feast for the eyes, there were some sore spots that left our team of editors scratching their heads. We meticulously combed the red carpet and asked Yahoo Canada readers to help us choose the best and worst dressed star from this year's Golden Globes. How did our readers vote? Keep reading to learn more. Zendaya's burnt orange look by Louis Vuitton struck a high note with Yahoo Canada readers, earning 27 per cent of votes. The 28-year-old channelled old Hollywood glamour in the gown that was accessorized with a statement-making diamond Bulgari necklace that featured a 31-carat Paraíba tourmaline from Mozambique. The finishing touch? Zendaya showed off her stunning engagement ring from her longtime beau, Tom Holland. Demi Moore's champagne gown came in a close second, earning 25 per cent of votes for best dressed. The strapless look featured a glamorous mermaid hem and Swarovski crystals on the bodice that sparkled as the star took the stage to accept her first Golden Globe for her performance in The Substance. Ali Wong may have gone home with a Golden Globe for her stand-up special Ali Wong: Single Lady, but her red carpet look was a fashion fail for our readers. The strapless red tulle look and dramatic black opera gloves earned 36 per cent of Yahoo Canada reader votes for worst dressed — earning her the title of worst dressed by a landslide. Ariana Grande's butter yellow Givenchy gown was runner-up for worst dressed. The look, which was originally crafted in 1966 as part of Givenchy’s couture spring collection. While the look is undoubtedly beautiful, the styling falls flat and the colour washes out the Wicked actress. Let us know what you think by commenting below and tweeting @YahooStyleCA!

Maybe you want to get yourself a fitness tracker first. Well, you should know that, sure, many people consider the Apply Watch to be the gold standard of smartwatches, but many people also consider the $199 or more you have to pay for one to be a bit steep. And, really, why do that, when there's a smartwatch that's much more affordable and still has tons of features that many folks love about the Apple bestseller? Meet the Popglory! It's easy to use, and at its sale price of $22, can you really go wrong? (The answer is no, you cannot.) Amazon Simple, clear and easy to read, the Popglory has a Find My feature and 10-plus hours of battery life while in active use, or 30 hours on standby. This is an immensely popular device that shares several features with the Apple Watch, but it's just $22 right now with the on-page coupon. (The purple one is down to just $19!) Compare that with the most bare-bones Apple Watch model you can buy, the Apple Watch SE, which starts at around $199. Meanwhile, Fitbit's most basic smartwatch, the Versa 4, is considered a deal at $150 — instead of its usual $200. There are a lot of budget smartwatches on the market, but most lack the quality that would make them worth the trouble. That's not the case with the Popglory, fans say. Of course, it tracks things like calories burned, steps walked, heart rate and even how well you slept — you know, all the smartwatch metrics you'd expect. But it also tracks blood pressure, a feature absent from both the Fitbit and Apple Watch. If you sit too long, it will remind you to stand up and move around. There are even buttons to control your music. Compared with many smartwatches we've seen at this price, the Popglory commands stellar reviews and has a wider range of functions. Plus, in keeping with its moniker, it's available in seven colors, including understated pink and vibrant purple. This affordable smartwatch has received almost 12,000 five-star reviews from customers who praise its accuracy and overall functionality. ""The Popglory watch does more than any current Fitbit watch,"" one user said. ""I had a Fitbit that took blood pressure. Now the Fitbits, for some reason, do not take blood pressure. I have had the Popglory [at the] doctor, and I had the same blood pressure within two points as my doctor got. That is fantastic."" ""Very efficient,"" said another fan. ""It tells my blood pressure, my heart rate and my oxygen level. ... There are so many wonderful features on this watch, it almost acts like an Apple Watch, and it connects to my Apple phone just perfectly. If something goes wrong with this watch, I am sure to get another. But I've had it for a little over a year now and it's still doing wonderful."" Many users have commented on its hefty runtime: ""I bought this last year, and I love it so much. It is pretty customizable and accurate. I love the battery life on it. You charge for one hour and it stays charged for about three days!"" ""I'm loving this smartwatch. It isn't huge,"" another five-star fan said. ""Great selection of faces to choose from. App seems to work great so far. I can't sleep with a watch on, so unsure about the sleep feature. Seems to be holding battery life well. Has a feature to tell you to get up and get active — who doesn't need that?"" Despite all its great features, the Popglory is missing a big one — it's not waterproof. But for the price, reviewers say that's a fair trade-off. ""I really like the sleep tracker on this watch, and the quality is very good,"" another wearer said. ""The only downside is that it's not waterproof, but for the price, I can't complain. Fantastic watch for the money."" ""This is an amazing watch ... great quality but without the Apple Watch price,"" a final fan said. But they cautioned: ""The downside is it may cause skin irritation to some.""

But some impact players are still available, and the trade market has been active. The Dodgers have signed KBO infielder Hyeseong Kim to a three-year deal with $12.5 million guaranteed. The contract has a two-year option for the 2028 and 2029 seasons that could allow the deal to be worth as much as $22 million. The 25-year-old Kim, who has played the past six seasons with the KBO's Kiwoom Heroes, was the first player from South Korea and Japan to be posted this offseason and has been training in Los Angeles for the past month. Kim, a left-handed hitter, is coming off a career season with the Heroes in which he hit 11 home runs, drove in 75 runs, stole 30 bases and posted a .326 batting average. It was his fourth straight season hitting over .300 and his seventh straight season with at least 20 stolen bases. The news comes on the same day the Dodgers officially welcomed Teoscar Hernández back to Los Angeles. Welcome back, Teoscar! pic.twitter.com/c20wyRKzLI — Los Angeles Dodgers (@Dodgers) January 3, 2025 Corbin Burnes is headed to the Arizona Diamondbacks, and it wasn't cheap. The 2021 Cy Young Award winner reportedly agreed to a six-year, $210 million deal with the Diamondbacks. Jon Heyman of the New York Post first reported the agreement, which includes an opt-out for Burnes after two seasons. Because Burnes, Yahoo Sports' No. 3-ranked free agent, turned down a qualifying offer from Baltimore, the Orioles will receive draft pick compensation from his new team. The contract is the largest in Diamondbacks history. Burnes, who lives in Scottsdale, Arizona, will pitch for the local team after reportedly turning down offers from the San Francisco Giants and Toronto Blue Jays. Gleyber Torres has agreed to a one-year, $15 million deal with the Detroit Tigers. The 28-year-old second baseman has spent his entire seven-year career with the New York Yankees. Last season, he hit .257 with 15 home runs, 63 RBI and 80 runs scored in 154 games. Free agent Gleyber Torres is in agreement with the Detroit Tigers on a 1-year, $15 million contract, sources tell ESPN. Torres had a great ALCS after a bit of down year on the power side for the Yankees. He'll start at 2b for Detroit. @JonHeyman was first with the agreement. — Jesse Rogers (@JesseRogersESPN) December 27, 2024 At first glance, this deal seems awfully low for a player of Torres’ track record and especially at his age, even if the sense in the industry was that the market could be on the cold side for the second baseman following his unremarkable final season with the Yankees. But Tigers GM Scott Harris acknowledged that Torres had larger offers available and instead chose the one-year pact with Detroit in hopes of reestablishing his value and hitting free agency again next winter. If Torres benefits from the change of scenery after seven years in New York and shows meaningful strides on both sides of the ball, he should be in position to secure a more significant multi-year deal a year from now, when he’ll still be one of the younger free agents at 29. The market for free-agent first basemen was noticeably slow until the week before Christmas. The Houston Astros struck first with a reported three-year, $60 million deal to acquire free-agent Christian Walker, previously a standout bat for the Arizona Diamondbacks. That triggered a chain of moves, as the D-backs opted to replace Walker by trading for Cleveland Guardians All-Star Josh Naylor last weekend, per ESPN's Jeff Passan. Then the Guardians reportedly signed old friend Carlos Santana for his third stint with the team. Santana spent last season with the Minnesota Twins, so we'll see if they do anything to respond. Meanwhile, the New York Yankees picked up former MVP Paul Goldschmidt on a one-year, $12.5 million deal. The first-base market still isn't close to finished, as Pete Alonso and others remain available. Required reading: Ranking the top 50 players available this winter Who will be MLB's first $1 billion player? What's the outlook for Pete Alonso? Follow along with Yahoo Sports as we track all the rumors, signings and more during MLB free agency: According to ESPN's Jeff Passan, the Yankees continue to be in discussions with the Padres over the 27-year-old Arráez. San Diego is looking to open up payroll as they go after other free agents like Roki Sasaki, who they reportedly are interested in signing. The Yankees are seeking to fill a need at second base with Gleyber Torres off to the Detroit Tigers. Arráez dealt with a bad thumb last season and batted .314 with 200 hits with the Padres and Miami Marlins. He's set to make $14.6 million next season and can become a free agent in 2016. Charlie Morton will play his 18th MLB season with the Orioles. The veteran agreed to a one-year contract with the AL East contender on Friday, the team announced. The deal is reportedly worth $15 million. The ageless curveball artist is coming off a 2024 season with the Braves in which he posted a 4.19 ERA and 23.8% strikeout rate across 30 starts. He'll join an Orioles rotation that direly needed both innings and effectiveness after the exit of Corbin Burnes, even after the signing of Japanese veteran Tomoyuki Sugano. We have agreed to terms with RHP Charlie Morton on a one-year contract for the 2025 season.Welcome to Birdland, Charlie! pic.twitter.com/QsqvAt3VLf — Baltimore Orioles (@Orioles) January 3, 2025 The Dodgers have reportedly signed infielder Hyeseong Kim to a three-year deal with $12.5 million guaranteed, according to The Athletic's Fabian Ardaya. The contract has a two-year option for the 2028 and 2029 seasons that could allow the deal to be worth as much as $22 million.

Hernández also ended 2024 with an .840 OPS — a full 100-point boost from his year in Seattle. As a bonus, he emerged victorious in the 2024 Home Run Derby.

FIRE US UP.Welcome to Arizona, Corbin Burnes! pic.twitter.com/5j0nriqt1a — Arizona Diamondbacks (@Dbacks) December 31, 2024 Right-handed starter Trevor Williams is returning to the Nationals, according to Stephen J. Nesbitt of The Athletic. Williams, 32, is a nine-year MLB veteran who spent the past two seasons with the Nats. In 2023, he had a 5.55 ERA over 30 starts and 144 1/3 innings, but he made vast improvements in 2024. Williams had a 2.22 ERA through 11 starts last season, but he went on the injured list in early June due to a right elbow flexor strain and didn't come off until the season had nearly ended. Williams should have the chance to start 2025 fully healthy after allowing just one earned run in his two September starts after coming off the injured list. Trevor Williams is returning to Washington Nationals on a two-year, $14 million contract, a source tells The Athletic. Williams, 32, had a 2.03 ERA over 13 starts last season. He missed some time due to a right flexor muscle strain. — Stephen J. Nesbitt (@stephenjnesbitt) December 30, 2024 The Chicago Cubs and Miami Marlins made a trade Sunday to swap a pair of infielders, per ESPN's Jeff Passan. In the trade, the Cubs pick up utility second baseman/right fielder Vidal Bruján, sending first baseman Matt Mervis to Miami. Both players are 26 and will get a fresh start to try for more major-league playing time. Trade news: The Chicago Cubs are acquiring utilityman Vidal Bruján from the Miami Marlins for first baseman Matt Mervis, sources tell ESPN. The deal is done. Both are former top 100 prospects looking to carve out at-bats in a new location. — Jeff Passan (@JeffPassan) December 29, 2024 This huge commitment to Burnes also represents an anticipatory move of sorts, with both Gallen and Kelly slated to hit free agency next winter. The D-backs have some decent pitching depth in the upper levels of their farm system, but nothing resembling a future ace who could step in if/when Gallen and Kelly depart. Burnes now fills that potential void in a big way — at least for 2026 (don’t forget the opt-out!). After an awfully quiet first month of the offseason, Arizona has burst onto the scene over the past few weeks with two aggressive moves to reassert their relevance in the National League hierarchy, first acquiring first baseman Josh Naylor from Cleveland to replace Christian Walker and now this gigantic agreement with one of the best starting pitchers on the market. With key offensive contributors Joc Pederson and Randal Grichuk no longer in tow, some questions remain about the depth of the lineup, and the bullpen — a clear weakness — has holes as well. But Burnes was one of the few players left on the market who can meaningfully raise the floor and ceiling of a roster, even if he doesn't appear to address an obvious need in Arizona. This is a huge win for the D-backs as they look to keep their contention window open and a huge blow to the runners-up for Burnes’ services — San Francisco and Toronto — who again came up short in their pursuit of a superstar. Read more here. While the six-year, $210 deal for Corbin Burnes makes sense from a commute perspective, it's a surprise from Arizona. A year after reaching their first World Series since 2001, the 89-win D-backs narrowly missed out on the playoffs in 2024 and remain mired in the NL West, arguably the most competitive division in baseball. The team is still set up to win, though, so it spent big for a new weapon after similarly big moves by the Los Angeles Dodgers (signing Blake Snell, re-signing Teoscar Hernández) and Giants (signing Willy Adames), with the San Diego Padres also lurking. However, the rotation already appeared to be a strength for the D-backs, at least relatively, given their high number of position-player free agents and a bullpen that ranked 25th in ERA last season. Even so, they decided to spend big to add another headliner alongside Zac Gallen, Merrill Kelly, Eduardo Rodriguez and Brandon Pfaadt. Jordan Montgomery is also still under contract after a disastrous 2024 — so bad D-backs owner Ken Kendrick called the contract a ""horrible decision"" — but he is now a clear trade candidate if a team wants to try buying low. It's also encouraging that the D-backs are spending despite being one of the teams to have their RSN implode with the Diamond Sports Group bankruptcy. Local cable revenue is a foundational component of the finances for teams such as Arizona, but the D-backs are still going for it. Beating the Giants' bid for Burnes is noteworthy, considering how competitive some teams in the NL West have been in free agency. Arizona did benefit from a more favorable income tax situation compared to Burnes' more significant suitors, though. Read more here. Teoscar Hernández is staying with the Los Angeles Dodgers for a few more years. The outfielder and 2024 World Series champion agreed to a three-year, $66 million deal with Los Angeles on Friday, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan. The deal reportedly includes a fourth-year option for $15 million, a $23 million signing bonus and, as is common for the Dodgers now, around $23 million in deferred money. Hernández had one of the best year-to-year turnarounds in 2024, following a disappointing 2023 with the Seattle Mariners with a stellar performance as a Dodger. Hernández was brought to L.A. to help boost the Shohei Ohtani-led Dodgers into a championship-caliber team, a mission that was certainly successful. Read more here. Before contemplating Torres’ fit on Detroit’s roster, let’s first consider the contract: one year, $15 million. At first glance, this seems awfully low for a player of Torres’ track record and especially at his age, even if the sense in the industry was that the market could be on the cold side for the second baseman following his unremarkable final season with the Yankees. But Tigers GM Scott Harris acknowledged Friday that Torres had larger offers available and instead chose the one-year pact with Detroit in hopes of reestablishing his value and hitting free agency again next winter. If Torres benefits from the change of scenery after seven years in New York and shows meaningful strides on both sides of the ball, he should be in position to secure a more significant multi-year deal a year from now, when he’ll still be one of the younger free agents available at 29. Harris also shed some light on the likely infield alignment after initial reports of Torres’ signing sparked questions about what the move means for the bevy of young infielders already on Detroit’s roster. Harris said Torres will be Detroit’s every-day second basemen, with Colt Keith — who signed a six-year extension before he made his MLB debut in 2024 — sliding to first base after spending the bulk of his rookie season at second. That would seemingly indicate a diminished role for former No. 1 overall pick Spencer Torkelson, but Harris said there are at-bats available if he’s producing. In Harris’ view, adding Torres makes the Tigers a better ballclub right now and will spark healthy competition for playing time elsewhere in the infield — a common dynamic for good teams. If that means making it more difficult to give playing time to the likes of Torkelson, Justyn-Henry Malloy or Jace Jung, so be it. On a team that considers itself a playoff contender, as Detroit does after its surprise run to the postseason in 2024, these players need to earn their playing time. On a related note, the other big question that looms over Detroit’s offseason is whether they remain in play for free-agent third baseman Alex Bregman. Bregman would obviously represent a substantial upgrade over any of Detroit’s internal options at third, and his experience having played under manager AJ Hinch in Houston helped build buzz for Detroit as a potential landing spot, particularly as other suitors have fallen out of the race. More important than any positional fit or prior relationships, though, is what it would take financially to get such a deal done. Unlike with Torres, who was comfortable agreeing to a shorter-term deal, Bregman and his agent, Scott Boras, are surely still seeking a massive, long-term contract, meaning Detroit would likely need to outbid several other Bregman suitors that have already demonstrated a willingness to spend big this winter. That still seems rather implausible at this stage, based on the Tigers’ more recent track record of relative frugality, but as long as Bregman remains available, the rumors will continue to swirl. The 28-year-old second baseman has spent his entire seven-year career with the New York Yankees. Last season, he hit .257 with 15 home runs, 63 RBI and 80 runs scored in 154 games. Free agent Gleyber Torres is in agreement with the Detroit Tigers on a 1-year, $15 million contract, sources tell ESPN. Torres had a great ALCS after a bit of down year on the power side for the Yankees. He'll start at 2b for Detroit. @JonHeyman was first with the agreement. — Jesse Rogers (@JesseRogersESPN) December 27, 2024 Coming into this winter, it was imperative for the Boston Red Sox to make multiple impactful moves following a disappointing finish to the 2024 season. And in light of the Yankees making several key pivots following Juan Soto’s departure, inactivity from Boston through another offseason wasn't an acceptable option. Well, slowly but surely the Red Sox are putting together a solid offseason and starting to look like a team that is serious about getting back to the postseason in 2025. The Red Sox’s biggest changes have been in their rotation, where they’ve had a serious overhaul. Adding starting pitching was the top priority for chief baseball officer Craig Breslow, and the Red Sox added arguably the best starter on the trade market in Garrett Crochet from the Chicago White Sox. But it takes more than one starter to get through the 162-game grind of the regular season. The Red Sox then added left-hander Patrick Sandoval, who’s recovering from Tommy John surgery, and they solidified their veteran presence on Monday by adding right-hander Walker Buehler on a one-year, $21.05 million deal. Buehler, who was No. 23 on Yahoo Sports' list of this winter's top 50 free agents, brings to Boston’s rotation a veteran arm who has pitched on baseball's biggest stages and experienced plenty of success. His 18 postseason starts are the most on Boston’s roster by far. Read the full story here. Astros general manager Dana Brown told reporters Monday that talks with longtime third baseman Alex Bregman stalled before Houston reached a deal with Christian Walker, effectively ending Bregman's time with the team. “I thought we made a really competitive offer, showing that we wanted him back,” Brown said on the day the Astros officially introduced Walker. “But we had to pursue other options. ""We couldn’t just sit there. We locked in [Isaac] Paredes early in that trade, knowing that he could play third or first, and then when the opportunity to add another bat came up, we just jumped on it.” Bregman's agent, Scott Boras, offered a retort to The Athletic: “Over time, teams learn if you’re running from leadership and talent, you’re running from the ultimate goal,” Boras said. Eloy Jiménez and the Rays have agreed to a minor-league deal, ESPN's Jesse Rogers reports. Jiménez, 28, batted .238 with a .626 OPS, 14 doubles, six home runs and 28 RBI last season for the White Sox and Orioles. An adductor strain and hamstring injury limited him to 98 games. News: DH Eloy Jimenez and the Tampa Bay Rays are in agreement on a minor league deal, sources tell ESPN. Jimenez, 28, played for the White Sox and Orioles this year and hopes to rebuild his career with a Rays team that has high aspirations in the American League East. — Jesse Rogers (@JesseRogersESPN) December 23, 2024 Since he hit 31 homers during his rookie season, injuries have been a consistent obstacle for Jiménez. Among the many issues he has dealt with have been a sprained ankle and right ulnar nerve contusion in 2019, a torn left pectoral tendon in 2021, a torn right hamstring tendon in 2022 and an appendectomy in 2023. However, Jiménez did hit 18 home runs, the second-highest total of his career, while playing 120 games in 2023. Outfielder/designated hitter Joc Pederson has signed with the Texas Rangers. Pederson agreed to a two-year, $37 million deal, according to The Athletic. The contract includes an opt-out after the first year. Last season with the Arizona Diamondbacks, Pederson hit .275 with a .908 OPS (both career bests), 17 doubles, 23 home runs and 64 RBI. He played exclusively as a DH but has played the outfield throughout his 11-year career, mostly in left and center field. Joc Pederson's deal with the Texas Rangers: 2 years, $37 million, with an opt-out after the first year. A perfect fit for their lineup. — Buster Olney (@Buster_ESPN) December 23, 2024 Pederson, 32, will replace Nathaniel Lowe in the Rangers' lineup. Lowe was traded to the Washington Nationals over the weekend for reliever Robert Garcia. The Boston Red Sox have landed a major piece in their quest to remake their starting rotation. According to Yahoo Sports' Russell Dorsey, the Red Sox and right-hander Walker Buehler are in agreement on a one-year, $21.05 million deal. The deal includes incentives and is pending a physical. Buehler, 30, is a two-time All-Star and two-time World Series champion with the Los Angeles Dodgers, which is the only team he's played for in his seven-year career. Buehler, who did not receive a qualifying offer from the Dodgers, essentially gets one from the Red Sox. Coming off a strong showing this postseason, he’ll now get to pitch a full season healthy with an opportunity to re-enter the free-agent market again next winter. https://t.co/JMZBpPmc6d — Russell Dorsey (@Russ_Dorsey1) December 23, 2024 Read more here.

In the wee hours of Monday morning, they reportedly agreed to reunite with left-hander Sean Manaea on a three-year, $75 million deal. Manaea, who will be 33 in February, had a career year with the Mets in 2024. He had a 3.47 ERA and 184 strikeouts over 32 starts and 181 2/3 innings. That's the lowest ERA of his career, maintained over the most innings he has ever pitched and anchored by the second-most strikeouts he has ever thrown. Before the 2024 season, his best numbers came with the Athletics in 2018, when he had a 3.59 ERA over 160 1/3 innings. Read the full story here.

Just a few minutes after news of the Josh Naylor trade hit, the Cleveland Guardians found their own first-base replacement by bringing back veteran Carlos Santana, per ESPN's Jeff Passan. It will be Santana's third stint in Cleveland, where he is second on the franchise's all-time walks list and sixth in home runs. First baseman Carlos Santana and the Cleveland Guardians are in agreement on a one-year, $12 million contract, pending physical, sources tell ESPN. The Guardians traded Josh Naylor, and now they bring the 39-year-old Santana back for his third stint with the organization. — Jeff Passan (@JeffPassan) December 21, 2024 A day after Christian Walker agreed to a deal with the Houston Astros, the Arizona Diamondbacks found his replacement by swinging a trade for Cleveland Guardians first baseman Josh Naylor, per ESPN's Jeff Passan. Going back to Cleveland will be pitcher Slade Cecconi and a competitive balance Round B draft pick. Naylor is coming off his first career All-Star selection and hit .243/.320/.456 with 31 homers for a team that emerged on top in the AL Central. The deal is worth a reported $12.5 million, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan. Last season with the Cardinals, the 37-year-old Goldschmidt batted .245 with 22 home runs and 65 RBI.

Reds were looking for a catcher who could help their young pitching staff alongside Tyler Stephenson, and Trevino fits the bill. Cruz is a strikeout machine whose ERA far exceeds his FIP, so Yankees hope he can be a high-leverage arm. Jackson is a defense-first veteran backup. — Jeff Passan (@JeffPassan) December 21, 2024 Cruz, 34, struck out 109 batters in 66 2/3 innings with a 4.86 ERA in 69 appearances. His strikeout total ranked fourth among MLB relievers last season. Trevino, 31, appeared in 73 games for the Yankees as the backup to Austin Wells. He batted .215 with a .642 OPS, eight home runs and 28 RBI. According to multiple reports, first baseman Christian Walker has agreed to a deal with the Astros. USA Today's Bob Nightengale reports the deal is for three years and $60 million. Read more here.

They've responded with an ""Island of Misfit Toys"" approach to the rotation. They signed Frankie Montas to a two-year, $34 million deal after a down season with the Reds and Brewers and agreed with former Yankees closer Clay Holmes on a three-year, $38 million deal, with the plan to convert him from reliever to starter. Their latest addition: Angels starter Griffin Canning, a former top prospect, on a one-year, $4.25 million deal, according to The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal. Canning holds a 4.78 career ERA and should slide into the back of the rotation. There were reports after the New York Yankees' trade for Cody Bellinger that the former MVP was told he would play center field on his new team, but Yankees manager Aaron Boone poured cold water on that idea Wednesday. Center field, left field and first base are all in play for Bellinger, who is a solid defender at each position. That makes sense for the Yankees, who have spots open in both outfield corners and at first. Aaron Judge played center field in 2024 but would likely move to right if Bellinger is available to take center. Nolan Arenado is one of the biggest names on the trade market, though not necessarily the most valuable, and we now know he probably won't be going to the Houston Astros. The St. Louis Cardinals third baseman has informed his club he will not waive his no-trade clause for a move to Houston, according to MLB.com. The Cardinals were reportedly willing to spend $15-20 million to the Astros to cover the $64 million in salary that Houston would have to take on (the Colorado Rockies are already on the hook for $10 million of the $74 million remaining on Arenado's deal), but they also needed Arenado's approval. A player invoking his no-trade clause doesn't always mean a trade is dead — often, the move is a ploy to shake some extra dollars out of his new team — but the Astros are reportedly not hopeful about a change. The team also already has a likely starting third baseman in Isaac Paredes, acquired from the Chicago Cubs in the Kyle Tucker trade. The New York Yankees have their Juan Soto replacement — or at least a guy who can take Juan Soto's place on the field. The team swung a trade with the Chicago Cubs for former MVP Cody Bellinger on Tuesday, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan, betting on a talented player to bounce back from a rough couple of years. The Cubs are also sending cash to the Yankees and will receive right-handed reliever Cody Poteet in return. Soto's record-setting pact with the New York Mets left the Yankees in dire need of a corner outfielder with enough pop to slide into the middle of the order. Bellinger could fit that bill and was available via trade due to his contract with the Cubs, which gives him player options for 2025 and 2026 that pay him a total of $52.5 million. It was clear a trade was coming after the Cubs acquired Houston Astros star Kyle Tucker in a blockbuster move, but there were rumors of the team shopping Bellinger even before they succeeded in acquiring Tucker. Read the full story here. While the New York Yankees are at a stalemate with the Chicago Cubs for OF/1B Cody Bellinger, they have turned their attention to the first-base market.They are engaged in talks with 4 free-agent first basemen: Pete Alonso, Christian Walker, Carlos Santana and Paul Goldschmidt. — Bob Nightengale (@BNightengale) December 17, 2024 Land of the Fried 🗽Welcome to Pinstripes, @MaxFried32 pic.twitter.com/13CZFDOrGs — New York Yankees (@Yankees) December 17, 2024 The Baltimore Orioles have struck a one-year, $13 million deal with right-hander Tomoyuki Sugano.

Marlins want young controllable bat back.James Triantos or Owen Cassie would likely be in the deal. @BNightengale first to report Cubs interest. — Bruce Levine (@MLBBruceLevine) December 14, 2024 The Houston Astros have already acquired one third baseman with Isaac Paredes via the return of the Kyle Tucker, but they might not stop there. Per The Athletic's Chandler Rome, Houston has emerged as a serious suitor in a trade for St. Louis Cardinals third baseman Nolan Arenado. Arenado is one of the biggest names on the market but not necessarily one of the most valuable players. He is still owed $74 million across the next three seasons, $10 million to be paid by the Colorado Rockies, and any team that takes him is going to want the Cardinals to take another bite out of that if they expect any sort of meaningful prospect return. Acquiring both Parades and Arenado would likely mean a move to first base or a utility role for Paredes, given Arenado's Gold Glove defense. And it almost certainly means Alex Bregman will be playing in a new uniform next season. The Rays are sending Jeffrey Springs to the A's in exchange for RHP's Joe Boyle and Jacob Watters, as well as OF Will Simpson. A compensatory draft pick will also be heading Tampa's way, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan. The 32-year-old Springs appeared in only 10 games over the past two seasons as he dealt with ulnar neuritis, as well as Tommy John surgery. He is owed $10.5 million each of the next two seasons, and his contract features a club option worth $15 million for 2027.

A mortgage calculator can help you see how different mortgage term lengths and interest rates will impact your monthly payments. Use the free Yahoo Finance mortgage calculator to play around with different outcomes. Our calculator also considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when estimating your monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a better idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest. Today’s average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.67%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is relatively low. If you had a $300,000 mortgage with a 30-year term and a 6.67% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,930, and you’d pay $394,752 in interest over the life of your loan — on top of that original $300,000. The average 15-year mortgage rate is 6.00% today. Several factors must be considered when deciding between a 15-year and 30-year mortgage. A 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to compound. However, because you’re squeezing the same debt payoff into half the time, your monthly payments will be higher. If you get that same $300,000 mortgage but with a 15-year term and 6.00% rate, your monthly payment would jump up to $2,532 — but you’d only pay $155,683 in interest over the years. Dig deeper: How much house can I afford? Use our home affordability calculator. With an adjustable-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for a set period of time and then increases or decreases periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years, then changes every year. Adjustable rates usually start lower than fixed rates, but you run the risk that your rate goes up once the introductory rate-lock period is over. But an ARM could be a good fit if you plan to sell the home before your rate-lock period ends — that way, you pay a lower rate without worrying about it rising later. ARM rates have also been higher than fixed rates lately. Before dedicating yourself to a fixed or adjustable mortgage rate, be sure to shop around for the best lenders and rates. Some will offer more competitive adjustable rates than others. Mortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes. You can also buy down your interest rate permanently by paying for discount points at closing. A temporary interest rate buydown is also an option — for example, maybe you get a 6% rate with a 2-1 buydown. Your rate would start at 4% for year one, increase to 5% for year two, then settle in at 6% for the remainder of your term. Just consider whether these buydowns are worth the extra money at closing. Ask yourself whether you’ll stay in the home long enough that the amount you save with a lower rate offsets the cost of buying down your rate before making your decision.

A normal mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed loan is 6.67%. However, keep in mind that's the national average based on Zillow data.

The research, published in JAMA Pediatrics on Monday, is a review of 74 other studies exploring how the mineral may affect children’s IQ levels. The analysis found a statistically significant association between higher fluoride exposure and lower children’s IQ scores. It showed that ""the more fluoride a child is exposed to, the more likely that child’s IQ will be lower than if they were not exposed,” Kyla Taylor, author of the study and a health scientist at the National Institute of Environmental Health Studies at the National Institutes of Health, wrote in an email. Taylor was not available for an interview. For every small increase of fluoride found in kids' urine, Taylor wrote, “there is a decrease of 1.63 IQ points in children.” The researchers did not suggest that fluoride should be removed from drinking water. According to the study authors, most of the 74 studies they reviewed were low-quality ones. All were done in countries other than the United States, such as China, where researchers analyzed fluoride levels in water and in urine. Fluoride levels in China and other countries tend to be much higher than in the U.S., the researchers noted. Fluoride has been added to public water supplies in the U.S. for decades. No studies in the U.S. have flagged any measurable decreases in children's cognitive development since fluoride was introduced. There has been a growing pushback against fluoridated water in a number of communities across the country. Some have already voted to remove fluoride from public water supplies. Dentists worry the findings will be potentially damaging to public health. ""What we have seen, though, in areas where fluoride has been removed, is that dental decay rates have increased dramatically,"" said Dr. Erica Caffrey, a pediatric dentist and chair of the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry’s Council on Clinical Affairs. Despite fluoride's proven benefits in preventing tooth decay, some experts say any possible link to neurotoxicity in kids should be studied further. ""At a minimum, we need urgently to have an independent scientific panel come together to review the evidence,"" said Dr. Bruce Lanphear, a professor of health sciences at Simon Fraser University in Canada. The U.S. Public Health Service recommends a fluoride concentration of 0.7 mg/L of drinking water. NIH's Taylor said there was not enough data to determine whether that level has any impact on children's IQs in the U.S. Dr. Courtney Peterson, a pediatric dentist in private practice in Buffalo, New York, is concerned about the movement against the fluoride. “I think people are going to freak out,” she said. “People are going to look at the headline and say high levels of fluoride will lead to a whole bunch (of problems) without actually looking into it."" Still, the battle over fluoride is likely to strengthen under President-elect Donald Trump's next term. His pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., previously said without credible evidence that fluoride is ""an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss,"" and other problems. Kennedy later told NBC News that ""fluoride is on the way out."" A major sticking point in the debate of fluoride is that there's never been a double-blinded, randomized, controlled clinical trial to examine how fluoride might affect children. Researchers at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, however, have begun a study of families with babies under 6 months old who use either fluoridated or nonfluoridated bottled water in their formula and drinking water. The plan is to follow the children for four years. This article was originally published on NBCNews.com",517,[],2025-01-06 19:32:46,2025-01-07 01:15:11

https://www.yahoo.com/news/americans-rage-insurers-goes-beyond-172235627.html,"Americans’ rage at insurers goes beyond health coverage – the author of ‘Delay, Deny, Defend’ points to 3 reforms that could help",,Business,The Conversation,6 min read,"It’s time to move from rage to regulation, an insurance expert argues.","Jay Feinman, Rutgers University",2025-01-06T17:06:59.000Z,"My book “Delay, Deny, Defend: Why Insurance Companies Don’t Pay Claims and What You Can Do About It” was thrust into the spotlight recently, after UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was shot and killed in what authorities say was a targeted attack outside the company’s annual investors conference. Investigators at the scene found bullet casings inscribed with the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose.” The unsettling echo of the book’s title struck me and many others. That killing – and the torrent of online outrage that followed – put Americans’ unhappiness with health insurers at the front of the national conversation. Many people responded not by mourning Thompson, but by blaming UnitedHealthcare and other insurers for failing to pay for essential medical treatments. Gleeful online trolls even celebrated the alleged killer as a heroic vigilante. Speaking as an insurance scholar, I think few should be surprised by this ghoulish reaction. The killing revealed many Americans’ resentment and even rage about insurance companies. And while the focus has been on health insurance, these frustrations extend across the broader insurance landscape. Homeowners insurance, for example, is becoming harder to get in many states even as coverage is shrinking, and auto insurance rates are skyrocketing. These trends are fueling widespread discontent with insurers of all kinds. As many recent stories of health insurance denials in the news show, policyholders are most outraged when insurers fail to keep their promises to pay claims promptly and fairly. And as I read people’s stories about their own experiences, I kept hearing echoes from my book. Too often, people say, insurance companies delay paying some claims, deny other valid claims altogether, and force policyholders to defend themselves in court – all to increase profits by cutting claim costs. But problems often begin long before anyone files a claim. Insurance consumers generally don’t know much about what they are buying. For homeowners, auto and many other types of insurance, companies seldom provide copies of policy language or accessible summaries of policy terms to prospective policyholders. Even when consumers have access to policies, many don’t read or can’t understand the long, complex legal documents. Similarly, they can’t anticipate the many ways a loss could occur or the problems that could result if it does. As a result, they are only aware of a few key terms and otherwise believe that they will be “in good hands” with a “good neighbor,” to quote two of the iconic phrases of insurance advertising. Then, when consumers need coverage, they discover that there are significant protection gaps. Health insurance can involve a tangle of limitations due to provider networks, medical necessity rules and preauthorization requirements. Homeowners reasonably expect that they will be fully covered for all major losses, but insurers have cut back coverage to account for rising costs due to inflation and climate change. As a result, when disaster strikes, too many Americans feel like they haven’t gotten the security they already paid for. Rebuilding trust in insurance won’t be easy, but it’s essential. Insurance is the great protector of financial security for the American middle class, but only when it works. As the recent reaction demonstrates, it needs to work better. The insurance industry won’t change by itself; the financial pressures on insurers from increasing losses and fierce market competition are too great. In order for insurance to serve its goals, lawmakers and regulators will need to take action. Based on my research, I see three big areas for improvement. First, the government can help make the market for insurance work better. Markets need information, and better information produces better results. Regulators should require that key information about coverage be available in an accessible format for all types of insurance. Consumers also need information on the quality of companies offering policies, and whether a company pays claims promptly and fairly is a key measure of quality. Consumers don’t have access to much reliable information on that now, so disclosure should be mandated there as well. Second, states would be wise to consider minimum coverage standards, especially for homeowners insurance, as insurers have been cutting back on coverage recently to reduce costs. New York addressed a similar problem in 1943, legislatively adopting a Standard Fire Policy, since copied in many states. Some 70 years later, the Affordable Care Act did something similar by requiring that insurers cover 10 “Essential Health Benefits.” In both cases, lawmakers set minimum standards that every company must meet. States again need to consider whether insurance coverage is too important to be left purely to the vagaries of the market. Third, policyholders need effective remedies when insurance companies are found to have acted unreasonably. Many insurance claims result in good-faith disputes about how much the insurance company should pay — for example, whether roof damage was caused by hail, which is usually covered by insurance, or just wear and tear, which isn’t. But other times, insurance companies deny claims after inadequate investigations or for spurious reasons. For example, a 2023 Washington Post investigation concluded that in the wake of Hurricane Ian, some Florida insurance companies aggressively sought to limit payouts by altering the work of their adjusters who inspected damaged homes. Some policyholders and their families had their Hurricane Ian claims reduced by 45% to 97%. The American Policyholder Association, a nonprofit insurance industry watchdog group, claimed to find “compelling evidence of what appears to be multiple instances of systematic criminal fraud perpetrated to cheat policyholders out of fair insurance claims.” When people find themselves in this sort of situation, they have to spend lots of time and effort fighting to get what they were owed in the first place. Even when an insurance company eventually relents, it still hasn’t fulfilled its original promise to the policyholder to settle claims promptly and fairly. In these cases, requiring additional compensation to policyholders and insurer disincentives for unreasonable conduct would level the playing field. The deep resentment many Americans feel toward insurance companies became apparent after the killing of Brian Thompson. Reforms such as these would be a meaningful response to that resentment.

Now, a medical journal has published the most reliable estimate yet and the numbers are low, reflecting more clearly on medical practices now being weighed by the U.S. Supreme Court. Fewer than 1 in 1,000 U.S. adolescents with commercial insurance received gender-affirming medications — puberty blockers or hormones — during a recent five-year period, according to the study released Monday. At least 26 states have adopted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors, and most of those states face lawsuits. A decision by the Supreme Court in a Tennessee case is expected later this year. President-elect Donald Trump has promised to roll back protections for transgender people. “We are not seeing inappropriate use of this sort of care,"" said lead author Landon Hughes, a Harvard University public health researcher. “And it’s certainly not happening at the rate at which people often think it is.” The researchers analyzed a large insurance claims database covering more than 5 million patients ages 8 to 17. Only 926 adolescents with a gender-related diagnosis received puberty blockers from 2018 through 2022. During that time, 1,927 received hormones. The findings, published in JAMA Pediatrics, suggest that fewer than 0.1% of all youth in the database received these medications. The researchers found that no patients under age 12 were prescribed hormones, an indication that doctors are appropriately cautious about when to start such treatments, Hughes said. “I hope that our paper cools heads on this issue and ensures that the public is getting a true sense of the number of people who are accessing this care,” he said. The database included insurance plans in all 50 states, but did not include youth covered by Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for low-income people. The study did not look at surgeries among transgender adolescents. Other researchers have found those procedures are extremely rare among young people. Not all transgender youth proceed with medical treatments, said Dr. Scott Leibowitz, co-lead author of the adolescent standards of care for the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, a leading transgender health group. Transgender adolescents “come to understand their gender at different times and in different ways,” he said, noting that the best care should include experts in adolescent identity development who can work with families to help figure out what’s appropriate for each young person. Leibowitz, who has worked in gender clinics in several U.S. cities, said the study “adds to the growing evidence base about best practices when serving transgender and gender diverse youth.” ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Snowflakes? Mittens? Reindeer? In much of the Northern Hemisphere, winter means colder temperatures, shorter days and year-end holidays. Along with these changes, a growing body of research in psychology and related fields suggests that winter also brings some profound changes in how people think, feel and behave. While it’s one thing to identify seasonal tendencies in the population, it’s much trickier to try to untangle why they exist. Some of winter’s effects have been tied to cultural norms and practices, while others likely reflect our bodies’ innate biological responses to changing meteorological and ecological conditions. The natural and cultural changes that come with winter often occur simultaneously, making it challenging to tease apart the causes underlying these seasonal swings. With our colleagues Alexandra Wormley and Mark Schaller, we recently conducted an extensive survey of these findings. Do you find yourself feeling down in the winter months? You’re not alone. As the days grow shorter, the American Psychiatric Association estimates that about 5% of Americans will experience a form of depression known as seasonal affective disorder, or SAD. People experiencing SAD tend to have feelings of hopelessness, decreased motivation to take part in activities they generally enjoy, and lethargy. Even those who don’t meet the clinical threshold for this disorder may see increases in anxiety and depressive symptoms; in fact, some estimates suggest more than 40% of Americans experience these symptoms to some degree in the winter months. Scientists link SAD and more general increases in depression in the winter to decreased exposure to sunlight, which leads to lower levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin. Consistent with the idea that sunlight plays a key role, SAD tends to be more common in more northern regions of the world, like Scandinavia and Alaska, where the days are shortest and the winters longest. Humans, special as we may be, are not unique in showing some of these seasonally linked changes. For instance, our primate relative the Rhesus macaque shows seasonal declines in mood. Some scientists have noted that SAD shows many parallels to hibernation – the long snooze during which brown bears, ground squirrels and many other species turn down their metabolism and skip out on the worst of winter. Seasonal affective disorder may have its roots in adaptations that conserve energy at a time of year when food was typically scarce and when lower temperatures pose greater energetic demands on the body. Winter is well known as a time of year when many people put on a few extra pounds. Research suggests that diets are at their worst, and waistlines at their largest, during the winter. In fact, a recent review of studies on this topic found that average weight gains around the holiday season are around 1 to 3 pounds (0.5 to 1.3 kilograms), though those who are overweight or obese tend to gain more. There’s likely more going on with year-end weight gain than just overindulgence in abundant holiday treats. In our ancestral past, in many places, winter meant that food became more scarce. Wintertime reductions in exercise and increases in how much and what people eat may have been an evolutionary adaptation to this scarcity. If the ancestors who had these reactions to colder, winter environments were at an advantage, evolutionary processes would make sure the adaptations were passed on to their descendants, coded into our genes. Beyond these winter-related shifts in mood and waistlines, the season brings with it a number of other changes in how people think and interact with others. One less discussed seasonal effect is that people seem to get friskier in the winter months. Researchers know this from analyses of condom sales, sexually transmitted disease rates and internet searches for pornography and prostitution, all of which show biannual cycles, peaking in the late summer and then in the winter months. Data on birth rates also shows that in the United States and other countries in the Northern Hemisphere, babies are more likely to be conceived in the winter months than at other times of the year. Although this phenomenon is widely observed, the reason for its existence is unclear. Researchers have suggested many explanations, including health advantages for infants born in late summer, when food may historically have been more plentiful, changes in sex hormones altering libido, desires for intimacy motivated by the holiday season, and simply increased opportunities to engage in sex. However, changes in sexual opportunities are likely not the whole story, given that winter brings not just increased sexual behaviors, but greater desire and interest in sex as well. Winter boosts more than sex drive. Studies find that during this time of year, people may have an easier time paying attention at school or work. Neuroscientists in Belgium found that performance on tasks measuring sustained attention was best during the wintertime. Research suggests that seasonal changes in levels of serotonin and dopamine driven by less exposure to daylight may help explain shifts in cognitive function during winter. Again, there are parallels with other animals – for instance, African striped mice navigate mazes better during winter. And there may also be a kernel of truth to the idea of a generous Christmas spirit. In countries where the holiday is widely celebrated, rates of charitable giving tend to show a sizable increase around this time of year. And people become more generous tippers, leaving about 4% more for waitstaff during the holiday season. This tendency is likely not due to snowy surroundings or darker days, but instead a response to the altruistic values associated with winter holidays that encourage behaviors like generosity. Like many other animals, we too are seasonal creatures. In the winter, people eat more, move less and mate more. You may feel a bit more glum, while also being kinder to others and having an easier time paying attention. As psychologists and other scientists research these kinds of seasonal effects, it may turn out that the ones we know about so far are only the tip of the iceberg.

A nutritional epidemiologist explains what food choices will help you get more restful z’s,,Health,The Conversation,6 min read,A growing body of research is finding a robust link between diet and sleep quality. But it’s not just the usual suspects like caffeine and alcohol that can get in the way of restful sleep.,"Erica Jansen, University of Michigan",2025-01-06T15:03:02.000Z,"You probably already know that how you eat before bed affects your sleep. Maybe you’ve found yourself still lying awake at 2 a.m. after enjoying a cup of coffee with dessert. But did you know that your eating choices throughout the day may also affect your sleep at night? In fact, more and more evidence shows that overall dietary patterns can affect sleep quality and contribute to insomnia. I am a nutritional epidemiologist, and I’m trained to look at diets at the population level and how they affect health. In the U.S., a large percentage of the population suffers from poor sleep quality and sleep disorders like insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea, a condition in which the upper airway becomes blocked and breathing stops during sleep. At the same time, most Americans eat far too much fatty and processed food, too little fiber and too few fruits and vegetables. Although it is difficult to determine whether these two trends are causally linked to one another, more and more research points to linkages between sleep and diet and offers hints at the biological underpinnings of these relationships. My colleagues and I wanted to get a deeper understanding of the possible link between sleep and diet in Americans who are 18 and older. So we analyzed whether people who follow the government’s Dietary Guidelines for Americans get more hours of sleep. Using a nationally representative dataset of surveys collected from 2011 to 2016, we found that people who did not adhere to dietary recommendations such as consuming enough servings of fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains had shorter sleep duration. In a separate study, we followed more than 1,000 young adults ages 21 to 30 who were enrolled in a web-based dietary intervention study designed to help them increase their daily servings of fruits and vegetables. We found that those who increased their fruit and vegetable consumption over a three-month period reported better sleep quality and reductions in insomnia symptoms. Research conducted outside the U.S. by my group and others also shows that healthier overall dietary patterns are associated with better sleep quality and fewer insomnia symptoms. These include the Mediterranean diet – a diet rich in plant foods, olive oil and seafood, and low in red meat and added sugar – and anti-inflammatory diets. These are similar to the Mediterranean diet but include additional emphasis on certain components in the diet like flavonoids, a group of compounds found in plants, which are shown to lower inflammatory biomakers in the blood. Within overall healthy diet patterns, there are numerous individual foods and nutrients that may be linked to quality of sleep, with varying degrees of evidence. For example, studies have linked consumption of fatty fish, dairy, kiwi fruit, tart cherries and other berries such as strawberries and blueberries with better sleep. One of the common pathways through which these foods may affect sleep is by providing melatonin, an important modulator of sleep and wake cycles in the brain. Fiber-rich foods like beans and oatmeal and certain protein sources – especially those that are high in the amino acid tryptophan, such as poultry – are also associated with higher-quality sleep. Individual nutrients that may be beneficial include magnesium, vitamin D, iron, omega-3 fatty acids and manganese. Some foods like salmon are sources of multiple nutrients. One important caveat with a lot of the research on individual foods, as well as diet patterns, is that most studies cannot easily disentangle the direction of the relationships. In other words, it’s hard to know whether the association is a result of diet affecting sleep, or sleep affecting diet. The reality is that it is likely a cyclical relationship, where a healthy diet promotes good sleep quality, which in turn helps to reinforce good dietary habits. With observational studies, there are also possible confounding factors, such as age and economic status, that may have important correlations with both sleep and diet. Aiming for higher intake of sleep-promoting foods isn’t necessarily enough to get better sleep. It’s also important to avoid certain foods that could be bad for sleep. Here are some of the main culprits: Saturated fats, such as that in burgers and fries and processed foods, could lead to less slow-wave sleep, which is considered the most restorative sleep. Refined carbohydrates, such as those in white bread and pasta, are metabolized quickly. If you eat these foods for dinner, they can result in waking up from hunger. Alcohol disrupts sleep quality. Although the sedative effects of alcohol can initially make it easier to fall asleep, it disrupts sleep patterns by shortening the amount of REM, or rapid eye movement, sleep in the first part of the night and leads to more night awakenings. Caffeine consumed even six hours before bed can make it difficult to fall asleep because it blocks the hormone adenosine, which promotes sleepiness. The consistent overconsumption of calories can lead to weight gain, one of the strongest predictors of obstructive sleep apnea. Having excess weight is a factor because it can put additional pressure on the diaphragm and lungs, and can also lead to a narrower airway if fat accumulates around the neck and throat. Interestingly, our group has recently shown that toxicants in food or food packaging, like pesticides, mercury and phthalates – chemicals used to manufacture plastics – can affect sleep. Since toxicants can be found in both healthy and unhealthy foods, this research suggests that some foods can contain a mix of components that are both beneficial and harmful for sleep. The timing and consistency of eating, known as “chrononutrition” in the sleep research field, also very likely help to explain associations between healthy diets and good sleep. In the U.S., eating at conventional meal times as opposed to random snacking has been associated with better sleep. In addition, late-night eating is typically associated with unhealthier food intake – such as processed snacks – and could cause more fragmented sleep. A final and very interesting piece of this puzzle is that associations between diet and sleep often differ by gender. For example, it appears that the associations between healthy diet patterns and insomnia symptoms could be stronger among women. One reason for this could be gender differences in sleep. In particular, women are more likely than men to suffer from insomnia. Overall, there is not one magic food or drink that will improve your sleep. It’s better to focus on overall healthy dietary patterns throughout the day, with a higher proportion of calories consumed earlier in the day. And, in addition to avoiding caffeine, alcohol and heavy meals in the two to three hours before bed, the last few hours of the day should include other good sleep hygiene practices. These include disengaging from technology, reducing light exposure and creating a comfortable and relaxing environment for sleep. Moreover, allowing enough time to sleep and maintaining a consistent bedtime and wake time is essential.

About 7 in 10 U.S. adults set goals at the start of a new year, and personal health or fitness goals are the most common, according to Gallup. But by mid-February, 80 percent of the people who set New Year’s resolutions will have abandoned them, Gallup reported. Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post. I, too, had tried before, my pledge generally lasting a few months before old habits (sitting! screens!) returned. But that year was different. I had a specific goal in mind - to compete in one obstacle course race. Tying my New Year’s resolution to something concrete was a critical first step to exercise being almost a nonnegotiable in my day. Last year, I completed my 56th race. Once a resolution is made, specific tactics make it more likely to stick. Here is what habit and fitness experts, and my own experience, suggest: - - - Have a longer-term obtainable goal Going out too hard is a common misstep, said Peter Duggan, a strength, conditioning and rehabilitation specialist at Fuel Sport & Spine in New York. “People say ‘I’m going to go crazy’ and then come in to see us injured by the middle to end of January,” he said. Having a longer-term goal and plan is better, suggested Duggan, who works with professional athletes and amateur fitness enthusiasts. That can be as simple as a 5K race in April or a 90-day first-quarter (Q1) challenge where you measure your January progress against your February progress and your March progress against February and January. This way, you have some form of momentum. But if January blows up because you get sick, then you still have February and March, Duggan advised. Start small if you’re a newcomer: Go from walking or jogging in January a couple of times a week to running 25 minutes two or three times a week in February and longer in March. Then set another goal for the next quarter. “You can’t just run up Mount Everest,” Duggan said. “You have to start at base camp. Use January or Q1 as base camp.” - - - Time block and preprogram your workout Waking up and thinking, “I’m going to exercise at some point today,” is a vulnerable strategy. You must then spend extra time figuring out what you’ll do, when you’ll do it and where - time you probably don’t have in an already full day. Instead, schedule and block out your exercise moments for the week, in advance, to reduce the likelihood of slipping back into old habits - such as coming home, jumping on the couch and scrolling on the phone. “Physical activity takes time, and you need to be mindful of your other habits that need to change,” said Chad Stecher, a behavioral health economist and an assistant professor at Arizona State University. “Not only are you building a new habit, but how does that habit fit into the rest of the day?” My solution: Since I live by my digital calendar for work, each week’s exercise gets scheduled in the same color-coded blocks as my meetings. I don’t skip meetings, so I don’t skip my workout. This removes the barrier of “at some point today.” - - - Leave yourself visual prompts Cues, particularly visual ones, are some of the strongest motivators to create a new habit, said Stecher, whose research focuses on habit formation. For instance, placing your running shoes or workout clothes where they are the first items you see when you wake up reduces the likelihood exercise will slip your mind, Stecher said. It also serves as a commitment reminder that “you intended to do this,” he said. In my living room, I keep a nice box that holds a yoga mat, balance board and foam roller. Seeing that box each time I walk to the kitchen means I’m more likely to use what’s in it when I have five to 10 minutes to spare. Accessibility also matters, Duggan said. “It has to be convenient,” he said. “We all have weeks when we are overwhelmed, but you can still carve out 20 minutes in your living room with some dumbbells or a HIIT [high-intensity interval training] class on an app.” - - - Build accountability slowly Recent research suggests the amount of movement we get in a day, as measured by a wrist tracker, is a stronger predictor of mortality than age, smoking or even diabetes. There is no shortage of apps, fitness trackers and health devices to gather data on our movement. The key is not letting the devices get in the way of actually exercising - especially when we are first building a habit. “I think if you are new to exercise, you don’t need all the fancy gear,” Duggan said. “Just start. Listen to your breath and feel your heart rate. As you get better, and crave more data, then you can buy more tools like a watch and a heart rate monitor.” A less complex (and free) tracking tool is what I call “completion signaling” - the act of checking a box and recording your progress when exercise is done. For instance, when doing multiple sets of an exercise at home, I move a pile of machine screws or small rocks from one mug to another. And each time I complete a workout, I mark it as “Done” in my digital calendar. Each action, however small, is a clear visual for me of forward movement and accountability. Put more simply, the reward of marking a workout as completed feels good; not checking that box feels bad. So, I am more likely to get the workout done. - - - Make exercise part of your identity Exercise becomes truly nonnegotiable when it’s part of your core identity, Stecher said, noting a growing body of research linking identity to maintaining behavior change. “Then, when your routine is interrupted, and the normal cues aren’t there, you’ll still go to the gym,” Stecher said. This rings true. Eight years ago, “fit person” or “athlete” were nowhere among the descriptors my friends and family used for me - nor ones I used for myself. Now, those monikers are as core to my sense of self as “writer,” “spouse” or “daughter.” The tactics above made that possible. - - - Bounds is the author of “Not Too Late: The Power of Pushing Limits at Any Age” and vice president of content and U.S. media partnerships at SmartNews.

Nearly two months later, what the record’s saying is that “pretty damn good” might be a galactic understatement. The Cavs head into Wednesday’s marquee matchup with the Thunder — a clash between the No. 1 seeds in each conference, and the teams with the best records in the NBA — riding a 10-game winning streak, with every victory coming by double digits. They just went 12-1 in December, blowing opponents’ doors off by a league-high 15.2 points per 100 possessions. They're 31-4 — 31-4! — which makes Cleveland just the eighth team ever to start a season with 31 wins in 35 tries. Four of the first seven went on to win the NBA title; Curry’s 2015-16 Warriors started 31-2, won an NBA-record 73 games, and came up one win short in one of the greatest NBA Finals of all time. After missing a combined 89 games last season, the core four of Donovan Mitchell, Evan Mobley, Jarrett Allen and Darius Garland have missed a total of four thus far this season; turns out having all your best dudes helps a lot. New head coach Kenny Atkinson has helped a lot, too, both in terms of how he’s managed staggering the core four — he’s largely paired Mitchell with Mobley and Garland with Allen, and Cleveland’s been excellent in both alignments — and in how he’s juiced the Cavaliers’ attack. The Cavs are playing faster, generating more possessions (sixth in pace this season, up from 24th last season) and getting shots up more quickly (38.6% of their attempts have come in the first nine seconds of the shot clock, up from 32.3% last season). That’s held true even after giving up a bucket; they’ve shaved more than a second off their average time-to-shoot following a made basket, according to Inpredictable, a commitment to applying pressure that can leave opponents feeling overwhelmed. (“Every coach’s nightmare,” Atkinson said. “Getting dinged in transition.”) A more diversified offense that leverages Mobley as a half-court hub and gets the guards off the ball more often has decreased Cleveland’s reliance on Mitchell’s shot creation. Throughout his career, Mitchell’s been the headliner, the sun at the center of his team’s solar system. It’s been a successful approach, producing five All-Star selections, an All-NBA nod and seven straight playoff berths. It’s also one that demands a ton of a player who’s already nearing 20,000 career minutes, who’s got the sixth-highest usage rate in the NBA since entering the league in 2017, and who's battled groin, hamstring, knee and calf issues over the past two seasons. Atkinson’s plan to bring Mobley and Garland closer to the center of the frame was also aimed at balancing Mitchell’s short-term productivity and long-haul freshness. So far, so good. Mitchell’s minutes, field-goal attempts, touches, time of possession and usage rate are all down, while his per-possession production has stayed steady; the share of his baskets that have been assisted, as opposed to self-created, is at an all-time high. Mitchell and Garland spending more time off the ball has fostered a more egalitarian attack. This isn’t stand-up or a one-man show; it’s more like improv, a collaborative effort marked by a feeling of fresh possibility in which one actor builds on what another establishes, and everyone gets to score: “The actions, the spacing, the way we’re moving, our pace,” Mitchell recently told reporters. “It’s like: It’s not predictable. You never know where each guy’s going to be.” Even those bullish on the Cavs before the season, though, likely didn’t expect them to open it performing like one of the most dominant teams we’ve ever seen. That sounds like hyperbole; somehow, it isn’t. Consider: The Cavs have won their 31 games by an average of 11.83 points, which would be the fifth-highest average margin of victory in NBA history, according to Stathead. The only teams to finish a season with a higher average margin: the 1972 Lakers, the 1971 Bucks and the 1996 Bulls. They all won the NBA title. Simple rating system, which accounts for a team’s point differential and strength of schedule, pegs the Cavs as one of the 13 strongest teams in league history. Nine of the 12 teams that have finished a season with a higher SRS than Cleveland’s went to the NBA Finals; eight won. The Cavs aren’t just leading the NBA in points scored per possession; according to Jared Dubin’s adjusted efficiency metric, Cleveland has the third most efficient offense since the ABA-NBA merger in 1976. Because they also remain excellent on defense — sixth in defensive efficiency this season, according to Cleaning the Glass — the Cavs own an era-adjusted scoring margin of plus-10.4 points-per-100 above league average, according to Dubin. Only eight teams since the merger have finished with a margin higher than 10. Six of them won the title. “They have the best record in the NBA, they have the No. 1 offense in the NBA, and no one seems to be able to stop that team,” Nuggets head coach Michael Malone told reporters after Cleveland buried Denver beneath a 149-point Cavalanche. “... Really, when you play them, there is no margin for error.” That’s due in large part to a combination of sure-handed play and sharpshooting. For all the crispness of the ball movement in Atkinson’s cutting-heavy attack, Cleveland actually ranks just 28th in the NBA in total passes per game. When you don’t put the ball in the air a ton, and when the quarterbacks tasked with shepherding the offense — Garland, Mitchell and increasingly Mobley in the starting unit, plus Ty Jerome and Caris LeVert off the bench — take good care of it, you tend to hang on to it. After finishing 17th in turnover rate last season, this year’s Cavs have climbed to third in how rarely they cough the ball up. Not turning the ball over means more opportunities to get shots up. And on a roster loaded with knock-down shooters, that’s a recipe for awfully long nights for opposing defenses. chill guy doing insane things.@tyjerome_ | #LetEmKnow pic.twitter.com/ahTN1EQF8z — Cleveland Cavaliers (@cavs) December 22, 2024 Seven Cavaliers are hitting at least 40% of their triples. (Eight, if you count two-way forward JT Thor going 3-for-4 so far.) That doesn’t include Sam Merrill, who shot 40% last season; Dean Wade, who shot 39% last season; Georges Niang, hitting 39% this season; and the just-returned Max Strus, a career 36.4% shooter on more than six attempts per game. After plenty of hectoring from pundits over his first two seasons, Mobley has stretched his game to the perimeter; he led the NBA in 3-point accuracy in December, shooting 52.4% from deep while taking 3.5 triples per game. (Allen, the only member of the Cavs rotation who doesn’t take 3s, has sharpened himself into an ideal implement on the interior, shooting nearly 70% on 2-point shots and serving as one of the NBA’s most effective high-volume pick-and-roll finishers.) As a team, Cleveland is shooting a blistering 40.4% from 3-point land — which not only leads the NBA, but would be tied for the eighth-best mark in NBA history — and they’re leaning even further into that identity as the season goes on, increasing their long-range volume month over month. The Celtics are on pace to become the first NBA team ever to take more than half of their shots from 3-point range; since the start of December, 3s have accounted for 48.7% of Cleveland’s attempts. And — as was the case with the Celtics when they laid out the blueprint last season, and as has been the case with the Knicks since pairing Karl-Anthony Towns with Jalen Brunson to supercharge their offense — the hidden value of all that shooting emerges when Cleveland exploits it to get into the paint. Mitchell turns on the jets, eurostep to the wraparound, extra rotation drive kick Mobley big-big pass to Allen, cut by Wade to Mitchell drive no look to the corner WHEW. pic.twitter.com/MnUoBRygPX — Hardwood Paroxysm (@HPbasketball) October 28, 2024 After finishing 17th in drives per game last season, the Cavs sit fourth this season, with Garland and Mitchell knifing to generate either point-blank looks for themselves or kickouts to all those gunners. Cleveland’s seventh in catch-and-shoot points per game; nobody produces more points per possession on spot-up shots. “They’re so intentional about the extra pass,” Draymond Green told reporters after former Warriors assistant Atkinson’s new team thumped Golden State in November. “And this is a staple for us: to drive, swing, swing. That’s what we preached for years, and they diced us up with it.” Pair elite turnover avoidance with elite shooting, and you’re going to have a consistently high offensive floor. The Cavs have only been held under one point per possession once — in their Nov. 29 loss to Atlanta — and have posted a below-league-average offensive rating just five times in 35 games. What makes them even more dangerous, though, is that they can combine that offensive excellence with 48 minutes of elite rim protection. Among 133 players to defend at least 75 shots at the basket this season, Allen ranks sixth in defensive field-goal percentage (50.3%), Mobley ranks 31st (56.7%) … and über-3-and-D glue guy Wade ranks 13th (53.4%), just behind Brook Lopez and Daniel Gafford. Dean Wade, nice player pic.twitter.com/iPnEPgtLtm — Jackson Frank (@jackfrank_jjf) November 6, 2024 So: We have a team with an elite offense that bombs away, hammers the paint and posts 50/40/78 shooting splits as a team; an excellent defense that can clamp down by playing things straight and junk up the game when necessary; that wins the possession battle most nights, thanks to top-five-ish marks in both preventing and generating turnovers; and has four players who, even if they don’t all make the All-Star team, all have pretty legit cases. That sounds like a really, really hard team to beat. “Against teams as good as Cleveland, you have to play close to perfect basketball,” Lakers head coach JJ Redick said after a loss on New Year’s Eve. “They’re not going to let you beat them. They’re not going to beat themselves. They really believe in what they’re doing.” All that’s left, then, is convincing everybody else. Maybe you look at Cleveland’s roster and see the need for a big wing yearning to be filled by someone like, say, Herb Jones, Cam Johnson or (as I recently pitched on The Big Number) Jimmy Butler. A bright-eyed optimist might submit that a platoon of Wade — a 6-foot-10 Swiss Army knife who fits neatly at power forward, small-ball 5 or big-ball 3 — LeVert, Strus and Isaac Okoro gives Atkinson enough options to solve postseason problems on the perimeter. (Especially if this is the year Okoro can translate his improved 3-point shooting — 48.6% from the corners, 50% above the break — into the playoffs.) Skeptics will point to Cleveland fattening up on a friendly early slate. The Cavs rank 30th in strength of schedule thus far, according to Basketball Reference and Dunks and Threes, and 29th by ESPN’s reckoning. They’ve also benefited from some good fortune in catching opponents at less than full strength along the way; over the past month, they’ve gotten the Celtics without Jaylen Brown or Derrick White, the Bucks without Damian Lillard, the 76ers without Joel Embiid and the Nuggets without Aaron Gordon. Will they fare as well against the East’s second-toughest remaining schedule? There’s also the fact that Cleveland’s not the hands-down bully on the block this season. Remember those gaudy margin-of-victory and simple-rating-system numbers from earlier? The Thunder — tops in the West, now 30-5 after knocking off the Knicks and Celtics over the weekend — actually rank ahead of the Cavs on both of those all-time lists. By Taylor Snarr’s adjusted metrics, which factor in the quality of opponents you’ve faced, Cleveland still profiles as a step below both OKC and Boston, despite its 5.5-game lead over the C’s in the standings. Most of all: It’s tough to shake memories of watching the Cavs get manhandled by the Knicks in 2023, or barely sputtering past the Magic before getting rinsed by Boston last season. Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Co. bore the burden of proof until they broke through; the Cavs, like every other team on its own hero’s journey, will face the same scrutiny and suspicion until they do it, too, no matter how many points they pile up along the way. “Ultimately, we’ll judge [the offense] by how it transfers to the playoffs,” Atkinson recently told reporters. Until we get there, all we can do is evaluate what we see — which is a team that has gone 13-4 against .500-or-better teams, 9-0 against the Western Conference and 6-1 against teams with a top-10 net rating. If you’re as good as your record says you are, then we have to conclude that the Cavs — a team that just keeps kicking everyone’s ass — is also one capable of winning the whole thing.",214,[],2025-01-06 19:34:37,2025-01-09 00:33:16
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-doubles-down-on-his-tariff-proposal-denying-a-shift-in-approach-171821390.html,"Trump doubles down on his tariff proposal, denying a shift in approach",,Politics,Yahoo Finance,4 min read,Rapidly changing signals on Donald Trump's plans for tariffs caused a lot of market whiplash Monday.,Ben Werschkul   · Washington Correspondent,2025-01-06T17:18:21.000Z,"One thing that is clear about President-elect Donald Trump’s plans for tariffs is that he aims to move quickly after he takes office. But that’s perhaps it. Rapidly changing signals on that topic caused a lot of market whiplash Monday following a Washington Post story outlining discussions among top Trump aides centered around a more limited set of tariffs that would be universal but only apply to what are deemed critical imports. Just a few hours later, Trump himself weighed in to flatly deny the story, writing on social media that the story ""incorrectly states that my tariff policy will be pared back. That is wrong."" The back-and-forth led the US dollar index down and then back up on Monday morning in reaction to mixed messages. Trump's ongoing tariff rhetoric comes after a weekend where, as part of his endorsement of ""one powerful Bill"" to implement his early economic agenda, he again promised that tariffs would be deep enough to pay for his expensive tax cut plans. He wrote that the trillions of dollars in shortfall ""WILL ALL BE MADE UP WITH TARIFFS.” The two scenarios — the desire for limited tariffs on one side and the equally strong desire to use tariff revenue to pay for big-ticket items — are ones that economic experts have long maintained are likely to be mutually exclusive. Some in his orbit said the president-elect has been direct about his intentions. ""President Trump has been very clear what he wants to do with tariffs,"" said Joseph Lavorgna, a former chief economist at the National Economic Council during Trump 1.0, told Yahoo Finance on Monday. Lavorgna called the tariffs part of a comprehensive Trump agenda coming this year that includes other issues like energy and taxes. Currently, tariffs bring in only a tiny fraction of US revenue. A Congressional Research Service report found that in fiscal year 2024, the US collected about $77 billion in tariffs, largely reflecting the duties imposed during Trump’s first term and then maintained and added to by Biden. That accounts for approximately 1.57% of total federal revenue and also doesn’t reflect the costs of tariffs born directly by the government. During Trump's first term, the then-president paid billions to farmers to help mitigate their losses when China retaliated on agricultural products. By contrast, the cost of extending Trump’s tax cuts alone is estimated by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget to cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $3 trillion over the next decade (or about $300 billion a year). And Trump is promising to use tariffs to pay for other new cuts as well, such as eliminating taxes on tips. All told, a detailed analysis showed that Trump's plans — including a universal baseline tariff and other additional tariffs — would bring in $2.7 trillion in revenue if implemented, a far cry from more than $10 trillion in new policy proposals. The contradictory signals sent this past weekend continue a theme from the campaign where Trump often makes outsized promises around the revenue that tariffs could bring in in the years ahead while many in his orbit outlined less aggressive details — a reflection of the political realities and some of the economic unrest that could follow. But the bottom line is that Trump will need his full suite of campaign tariff promises — and perhaps even more — if he is serious about covering the costs. ""The market is obviously signaling that they take Trump's campaign promises very seriously,"" said Henrietta Treyz, Veda Partners director of economic policy, in a live Yahoo Finance appearance on Monday morning. She said that markets should be ready for steep tariffs from Trump and also noted that some of the incoming president's tariff authority could be deployed in as little as 12 hours. ""So the street should be ready for that,"" she added. Ben Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.

The company said it’s bringing its Intel 200V series processors to enterprise systems at a time when the industry is gearing up for the end of Windows 10 support, which should boost sales throughout 2025 and beyond. Intel’s second-generation Core Ultra processor, the 200V is designed to handle on-device AI tasks while simultaneously offering better overall battery life and performance than prior Intel chips. The company previously showed off the Core Ultra 200V for consumer systems in September. Intel’s announcement comes as it faces stiff competition from longtime rival AMD (AMD), which showed off its AI Pro 300 series of processors for commercial systems back in October. Chipmaker Qualcomm is also moving in on Intel’s turf with its own Snapdragon X Elite line of semiconductors for Windows-based computers. According to David Feng, vice president of Intel’s client computing group, laptops running the company’s Core Ultra 200V will get 10.5 hours of battery life while using Microsoft Teams and 20.3 hours using Microsoft 365. AMD’s Ryzen AI 7 Pro 360 gets 6.1 hours of use while running Windows Teams and 13.5 hours while running Microsoft 365. Qualcomm’s (QCOM) Snapdragon X Elite, meanwhile, got 9.2 hours of use out of Teams and 18.5 hours while using Microsoft 365, according to Intel's testing. Intel is pushing the Core Ultra 200V line as a major upgrade for enterprise users looking to get into using on-device AI apps rather than those that run exclusively in the cloud. On-device AI promises better overall safety and privacy because, unlike cloud-based AI apps, you don’t have to send your data over the internet. Instead, your PC processes your data locally. In addition to the Core Ultra 200V’s AI capabilities, Intel is banking on Microsoft’s (MSFT) move to end support for Windows 10 in October as a potential boon for chip and device sales in the latter half of the year. “2025 is the year of refresh driven by innovation,” Feng said. “And we’re working closely with Microsoft to accelerate the enterprise transition to Windows 11 and harness the benefits of AI between Microsoft experiences and the broad Intel … ecosystem.” The 200V is also Intel’s first chip designed to meet Microsoft’s Copilot+ PC standard, which means it provides the power needed to run AI tasks like Microsoft’s Windows Recall, a feature that can take snapshots of what you do on your PC so that you can easily search for them later. Intel’s latest offering comes at a precarious time for the company. In December, Intel’s board ousted CEO Pat Gelsinger after the chipmaker’s stock price collapsed some 60% over the last year. At least some of those declines have to do with Gelsinger’s massive turnaround effort that sought to transform Intel into a third-party contract chip manufacturer. But the move has proven costly for Intel. Even after turning its Intel Foundry segment into an independent subsidiary to coax customers into trusting that the company would treat its own chips and customers’ semiconductors the same, the venture continues to hemorrhage cash. And while the company has signed deals to build custom chips for both Microsoft and Amazon, a number of Wall Street analysts still view the foundry effort as a losing proposition. If the company is going to have a better 2025, it all starts with its chip sales. And enterprise offerings will be a major part of that. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/prison-officer-filmed-having-sex-171651736.html,Prison officer Linda De Sousa Abreu jailed after filming sex with inmate in cell,,World,The Telegraph,3 min read,A prison officer filmed having sex with a burglar in his prison cell has been jailed for 15 months after admitting another incident with the same inmate on the same day.,Timothy Sigsworth,2025-01-06T17:16:51.000Z,"A prison officer filmed having sex with a burglar in his prison cell has been jailed for 15 months after admitting another incident with the same inmate on the same day. Linda De Sousa Abreu, 30, of Fulham, appeared in an explicit video filmed inside HMP Wandsworth prison in south London which went viral online last year. The prison officer, wearing full uniform, was filmed by another prisoner having sex with Linton Weirich, 36, in June, with what the judge described as “evident enthusiasm”. She was sentenced on Monday at Isleworth crown court to 15 months in prison, half of which will be served on licence, after admitting three separate sexual encounters with the convicted burglar. Abreu, an OnlyFans model who also appeared on a Channel 4 television series about swinging, previously pleaded guilty to misconduct in a public office. Sentencing her, Judge Martin Edmunds KC, the Recorder of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, said a fellow prisoner, who was not named, filmed the tryst on an “unauthorised phone” while appearing to smoke cannabis. “The recording lasts some four-and-a-half minutes,” the judge said. “You participated with evident enthusiasm. The second prisoner recorded events and provided a commentary by way of encouragement, including saying: ‘Guys we made history’, ‘This is how we live at Wandsworth bruv’, and ‘You know you are a gangsta’.” Judge Edmunds said Abreu had also admitted two other sexual liaisons with Weirich, a convicted burglar, one of which was accidentally recorded on her bodyworn camera. “One was performing oral sex on the same prisoner on a separate occasion on the same day, an event partly recorded, by accident, on your prison issued body worn camera,” he said. “The other was a previous occasion of sexual intercourse with the same prisoner.” He added: “They show that this offence was not isolated. It was part of repeated behaviour. It is not clear when the earliest offence occurred so I shall assume the repetition was within a few days.” Judge Edmunds said Abreu “knew that conduct was forbidden and forbidden for good reason” and that it had put “fellow officers at increased risk”. “It is inevitable that the damage for which you were responsible at Wandsworth has spread, to some degree, through the prison estate,” he said. In a statement earlier read to the court, Andrew Davy, the governor of HMP Wandsworth, said her actions had “undone years” of efforts to increase male prisoners’ respect for female officers. “It has taken many years for female staff to be respected and treated professionally in a male dominated environment,” he said. “The action of this defendant has undone years of positive and rewarding prisoner interactions in less than a day.” Rajiv Menon KC, representing Abreu, told the court she accepted “full responsibility” for her actions. He asked that her sentence be reduced, citing a psychiatric report that found she had a “severe personality disorder” that combined with ADHD made her a “highly impulsive and reckless person who tends to act without considering the consequences”. “(The doctor) then concludes that Ms Abreu is a highly emotional, damaged individual who over the years has increasingly used sex as a means to feel positive emotions,” he told the court. “We submit on her behalf that the mental disorder should in all fairness significantly reduce her culpability in this case.” Abreu was close to tears as Judge Edmunds sentenced her. “The sentence on you is one of 15 months’ imprisonment,” he said. “Of that you will serve half in custody, unless the prison authorities decide to release you earlier. The remainder you will serve on licence. “You have been subject to a qualifying curfew for 190 days and that entitles you to a credit of 95 days against that sentence.” Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Stone,2025-01-06T14:50:13.000Z,"Demi Moore’s recent Golden Globe win for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy for her role in “The Substance” has reignited interest in her past work, particularly her 1996 appearance on “Late Show with David Letterman” promoting the film “Striptease.” A video clip from that interview has resurfaced on social media, sparking discussions among fans and critics alike. In the 1996 interview, Moore appeared on Letterman’s show to promote “Striptease,” a film where she portrayed a single mother who becomes a stripper to fund a custody battle. The appearance was notable for its playful and provocative nature, aligning with the film’s themes. At the time, “Striptease” was a significant project for Moore, earning her a then-unprecedented salary of $12.5 million, highlighting her status as one of Hollywood’s leading actresses. The resurfaced video has elicited a range of reactions on social media. One user commented, “Here we are basically 30 years later and she’s somehow even hotter still,” while another remarked, “Been that girl.” Some viewers expressed discomfort with Letterman’s behavior during the interview, with comments like, “can’t watch this without twirling my hair n kicking my feet but wtf is he doing by the end.” Moore’s recent Golden Globe win is seen by many as a triumphant comeback. In her acceptance speech, she reflected on her 45-year career, stating, “I’ve been doing this a long time – like over 45 years – and this is the first time I’ve ever won anything as an actor.” She also shared that she had considered quitting the industry before being cast in “The Substance,” saying, “The universe told me, ‘You are not done.'” The renewed attention to her past work, combined with her recent accolades, has led to discussions about the trajectory of Moore’s career. Some view her journey as one of resilience and reinvention, noting that despite facing industry challenges and public scrutiny, she has achieved a significant milestone with her Golden Globe win. Whether this constitutes the greatest comeback in Hollywood in recent years is subjective. However, Moore’s ability to captivate audiences across different eras and her recent recognition suggests a remarkable and enduring presence in the entertainment industry.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/cassava-perilous-past-promising-future-160305345.html,Cassava: The perilous past and promising future of a toxic but nourishing crop,,Lifestyle,The Conversation,7 min read,"Cassava’s many assets would seem to make it the ideal crop, except for one drawback: It’s highly poisonous. Human ingenuity has made cassava edible for millennia.","Stephen Wooding, University of California, Merced",2025-01-06T16:03:05.000Z,"The three staple crops dominating modern diets – corn, rice and wheat – are familiar to Americans. However, fourth place is held by a dark horse: cassava. While nearly unknown in temperate climates, cassava is a key source of nutrition throughout the tropics. It was domesticated 10,000 years ago, on the southern margin of the Amazon basin in Brazil, and spread from there throughout the region. With a scraggly stem a few meters tall, a handful of slim branches and modest, hand-shaped leaves, it doesn’t look like anything special. Cassava’s humble appearance, however, belies an impressive combination of productivity, toughness and diversity. Over the course of millennia, Indigenous peoples bred it from a weedy wild plant into a crop that stores prodigious quantities of starch in potatolike tubers, thrives in Amazonia’s poor soils and is nearly invulnerable to pests. Cassava’s many assets would seem to make it the ideal crop. But there’s a problem: Cassava is highly poisonous. How can cassava be so toxic, yet still dominate diets in Amazonia? It’s all down to Indigenous ingenuity. For the past 10 years, my collaborator, César Peña, and I have been studying cassava gardens on the Amazon River and its myriad tributaries in Peru. We have discovered scores of cassava varieties, growers using sophisticated breeding strategies to manage its toxicity, and elaborate methods for processing its dangerous yet nutritious products. One of the most formidable challenges faced by early humans was getting enough to eat. Our ancient ancestors relied on hunting and gathering, catching prey on the run and collecting edible plants at every opportunity. They were astonishingly good at it. So good that their populations soared, surging out of humanity’s birthplace in Africa 60,000 years ago. Even so, there was room for improvement. Searching the landscape for food burns calories, the very resource being sought. This paradox forced a trade-off for the hunter-gatherers: burn calories searching for food or conserve calories by staying home. The trade-off was nearly insurmountable, but humans found a way. A little more than 10,000 years ago, they cleared the hurdle with one of the most transformative innovations in history: plant and animal domestication. People discovered that when plants and animals were tamed, they no longer needed to be chased down. And they could be selectively bred, producing larger fruits and seeds and bulkier muscles to eat. Cassava was the champion domesticated plant in the neotropics. After its initial domestication, it diffused through the region, reaching sites as far north as Panama within a few thousand years. Growing cassava didn’t completely eliminate people’s need to search the forest for food, but it lightened the load, providing a plentiful, reliable food supply close to home. Today, almost every rural family across the Amazon has a garden. Visit any household and you will find cassava roasting on the fire, being toasted into a chewy flatbread called casabe, fermenting into the beer called masato, and steaming in soups and stews. Before adopting cassava in these roles, though, people had to figure out how to deal with its toxicity. One of cassava’s most important strengths, its pest resistance, is provided by a powerful defense system. The system relies on two chemicals produced by the plant, linamarin and linamarase. These defensive chemicals are found inside cells throughout the cassava plant’s leaves, stem and tubers, where they usually sit idle. However, when cassava’s cells are damaged, by chewing or crushing, for instance, the linamarin and linamarase react, releasing a burst of noxious chemicals. One of them is notorious: cyanide gas. The burst contains other nasty substances as well, including compounds called nitriles and cyanohydrins. Large doses of them are lethal, and chronic exposures permanently damage the nervous system. Together, these poisons deter herbivores so well that cassava is nearly impervious to pests. Nobody knows how people first cracked the problem, but ancient Amazonians devised a complex, multistep process of detoxification that transforms cassava from inedible to delicious. It begins with grinding cassava’s starchy roots on shredding boards studded with fish teeth, chips of rock or, most often today, a rough sheet of tin. Shredding mimics the chewing of pests, causing the release of the root’s cyanide and cyanohydrins. But they drift away into the air, not into the lungs and stomach like when they are eaten. Next, the shredded cassava is placed in rinsing baskets where it is rinsed, squeezed by hand and drained repeatedly. The action of the water releases more cyanide, nitriles and cyanohydrins, and squeezing rinses them away. Finally, the resulting pulp can be dried, which detoxifies it even further, or cooked, which finishes the process using heat. These steps are so effective that they are still used throughout the Amazon today, thousands of years since they were first devised. Amazonians’ traditional methods of grinding, rinsing and cooking are a sophisticated and effective means of converting a poisonous plant into a meal. Yet, the Amazonians pushed their efforts even further, taming it into a true domesticated crop. In addition to inventing new methods for processing cassava, they began keeping track and selectively growing varieties with desirable characteristics, gradually producing a constellation of types used for different purposes. In our travels, we have found more than 70 distinct cassava varieties that are highly diverse, physically and nutritionally. They include types ranging in toxicity, some of which need laborious shredding and rinsing and others that can be cooked as is, though none can be eaten raw. There are also types with different tuber sizes, growth rates, starch production and drought tolerance. Their diversity is prized, and they are often given fanciful names. Just as American supermarkets stock apples called Fuji, Golden Delicious and Granny Smith, Amazonian gardens stock cassavas called bufeo (dolphin), arpón (harpoon), motelo (tortoise) and countless others. This creative breeding cemented cassava’s place in Amazonian cultures and diets, ensuring its manageability and usefulness, just as the domestication of corn, rice and wheat cemented their places in cultures elsewhere. While cassava has been ensconced in South and Central America for millennia, its story is far from over. In the age of climate change and mounting efforts toward sustainability, cassava is emerging as a possible world crop. Its durability and resilience make it easy to grow in variable environments, even when soils are poor, and its natural pest resistance reduces the need to protect it with industrial pesticides. In addition, while traditional Amazonian methods for detoxifying cassava can be slow, they are easy to replicate and speed up with modern machinery. Furthermore, the preference of Amazonian growers to maintain diverse types of cassava makes the Amazon a natural repository for genetic diversity. In modern hands, they can be bred to produce new types, fitting purposes beyond those in Amazonia itself. These advantages spurred the first export of cassava beyond South America in the 1500s, and its range quickly spanned tropical Africa and Asia. Today, production in nations such as Nigeria and Thailand far outpaces production in South America’s biggest producer, Brazil. These successes are raising optimism that cassava can become an eco-friendly source of nutrition for populations globally. While cassava isn’t a familiar name in the U.S. just yet, it’s well on its way. It has long flown under the radar in the form of tapioca, a cassava starch used in pudding and boba tea. It’s also hitting the shelves in the snack aisle in the form of cassava chips and the baking aisle in naturally gluten-free flour. Raw cassava is an emerging presence, too, showing up under the names “yuca” and “manioc” in stores catering to Latin American, African and Asian populations. Track some down and give it a try. Supermarket cassava is perfectly safe, and recipes abound. Cassava fritters, cassava fries, cassava cakes … cassava’s possibilities are nearly endless.

It's no secret that science fiction writers are fond of rooting their imagined alien lifeforms on theoretical desert planets. These arid worlds have dominated the big screen in major blockbuster franchises like ""Dune"" and ""Star Wars,"" the former of which is famous for its setting where deadly sandworms lurk beneath the surface. Unfortunately, however, fans hoping for such signs of life on desert worlds will probably be disappointed — at least, that's according to recent research conducted by NASA. The barren, parched landscape of Arrakis, where the central plot of ""Dune"" takes place, is teeming with thousands of deadly sandworms that live in the desert. However, even on desert planets in so-called habitable zones around their stars — where scientists predict extraterrestrial species could have evolved because it isn't too hot nor too cold for a world to host some liquid water — life is unlikely to survive. That's because of the violent ways in which these planets lose the bulk of their water, according to scientists presenting their preliminary findings at the American Geophysical Union's 2024 annual conference (a peer-reviewed paper about the crew's conclusions hasn't yet been published). The science team with NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory project, which is aimed at looking for signs of alien life in distant solar systems, suggested that planets considered habitable are likely to need water on their surface for the classic reasons — but also for some you may not expect. For example, the team discovered that water plays a key role in stopping a planet's temperature from fluctuating. Life on Earth generally requires a relatively stable temperature in order to survive, so that'd likely be the case on other worlds if the life that exists there is similar to life as we know it. ""These arid, dry planets, with significantly less than one Earth's ocean of water may be common throughout the universe,"" Haskelle Trigue White-Gianella, a Ph.D. student at the University of Washington who ran computer simulations tracking the evolution of desert planets, said during the talk. ""We found that there is a threshold of water needed to maintain a stable climate … Even if a planet is in the habitable zone, if it has too small a water inventory, it transitions to an uninhabitable state."" Planets like Earth with large amounts of water tend to remain stable, climate-wise, for around 4.5 billion years, the research team concluded. However, planets with small amounts of water seem to eventually lose that water and become unstable, the scientists said. And finally, they explained that planets with less than 10% of their surface covered by water are particularly at risk. Most hot planets with some surface water also have rain clouds which help to regulate the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, thereby cooling it. Losing such water content can lead to a breakdown in the carbon cycle, where silicate weathering stops removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and the planet experiences runaway climate change — the same process thought to have occurred on Venus, which may once have been habitable. Scientists believe that Venus' oceans boiled away as solar activity intensified, warming the planet as the evaporating water acted as a powerful greenhouse gas. If other potentially habitable desert worlds lost their water in the same way Venus did, it's unlikely that any life could have survived on those planets. The Jawas and Tusken Raiders from ""Star Wars"", for example, wouldn't have been able to evolve on the sand-covered Tatooine (perhaps unless they arrived after it had already turned into a desert world, then figured out how to adapt). However, to reiterate, our predictions about what extraterrestrial life may look like are based on our own understanding of evolution on Earth — and we still don't fully understand the process by which planets become more desert-like. Mars has dune fields around its ""green crater,"" but it is generally not a sandy planet, for instance, and Saturn's moon Titan is covered in dark sands made from organic matter. NASA hopes to learn more about the latter with its ""Dragonfly"" mission scheduled for 2028 — but, as of now, its intricacies remain a mystery. We're told in ""Dune"" that Arakkis orbits a short-lived star called Canopus (Alpha Carinae) approximately 310 light-years from Earth. Bright giant stars like Canopus usually only last a few hundred millions of years before burning out, whereas it took life on Earth around 800 million years to evolve, making the prospect of life evolving around Canopus unlikely. Further into the novels, we learn that the sandworms (minor spoiler warning) are an invasive species introduced as plankton that later evolve into what the characters call ""sandtrout,"" which eventually cause the collapse of the biosphere. When they become fully-grown sandworms, they trap the planet's water underground, turning the surface of Arrakis into a desert creating the ""spice melange’"" that enables space travel in the series. In ""The Science of Dune,"" a book laying out the science for how life could survive and evolve on a planet like Arrakis, planetary physicist Kevin Grazier speculates that the sandtrout do not produce the spice melange themselves, but instead tend to a fungus deep underground that produces it — maintaining it in a symbiotic relationship, in a similar way to how leafcutter ants cultivate fungi for food. This would also explain the hallucinogenic properties of spice melange, he argues. From Children of Dune, Frank Herbert's third novel in the series, it’s understood that the sandworms are not native, but were brought to Arrakis from another planet — though it's not stated whether this was accidental or intended. If the process of terraforming is similar to what happens when observable exoplanets lose their water, then NASA’s work suggests that no living creature would survive — but we aren't told enough about the origin of the sandworms, like whether they're naturally occurring or genetically engineered, to know for sure.

The planet is home to native inhabitants such as the womp rat, the bantha, the sarlacc, and the krayt dragon, creatures that probably wouldn't have survived the desertification process that NASA identified. ""To conclude, [these types of] sci-fi fiction worlds are probably not real,"" said White-Gianella. ""So I'm sorry to those fans.""",1,[],2025-01-06 19:51:01,2025-01-07 01:50:25

And that’s probably the hardest part of the journey: fixing your gaze on the unlikeliest of destinations, drawing a road map, and then getting people to actually go along with you, believing they’re going the right way. That’s what I thought of Sunday night watching Dan Campbell and the Detroit Lions. A head coach and franchise that lost the NFC title game 344 days ago — victims of their own aggression and mistakes — and somehow, some way, came back and drew an even better map back to a Super Bowl doorstep. They beat a streaking 14-2 Minnesota Vikings team that looked ready to give Detroit everything it could handle, only to get disassembled 31-9 in shocking fashion. In the process, the Lions secured the No. 1 playoff seed in the NFC for the first time in team history, earning a bye week of much-needed rest, and forcing the conference’s road to the New Orleans Super Bowl to run through Detroit. None of it guarantees the Lions will actually make it to the NFC title game again, let alone break through to a Super Bowl. But it does cement something: That what we saw in Detroit last season — an unyielding resilience and belief matched by talent and coaching — was unquestionably authentic. Not just because the Lions managed to raise a flag in the postseason again, but because it was planted on the most coveted and hotly contested real estate available. A No. 1 seed that went down to the last game of the season, between two teams that had improbably both won 14 games. Forcing an NFL team — for the first time in league history — to have to win 15 games to secure the top seed in a playoff field. The Detroit Lions did this. Dan Campbell did this. General manager Brad Holmes did this. Defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn and offensive coordinator Ben Johnson, Jared Goff and Jahmyr Gibbs, Brian Branch and a furiously paddling rotation of defensive players — they all did this. These new “same old Lions,” established in 2021 — who went from three regular season wins to nine. Then 12 to 15. From the rear end of anything just three Januaries ago, to maybe the front end of everything one month from now. It hurt getting here, of course. Even with the league’s highest scoring offense, it was hardly an easy 15 wins. It took some comebacks and some breaks and often came at a steep cost on the injury report. But as Campbell’s teams have done for two straight seasons, there was a stiffened response to adversity. In the parlance of Campbell’s introductory speech, Detroit got knocked down and lost defensive end Aidan Hutchinson, then bit a kneecap on the way back up. It absorbed Goff throwing five interceptions in a game, but rose up to take another kneecap. It lost David Montgomery, Marcus Davenport, Alim McNeill, Alex Anzalone and many, many others — only to respond by getting up and taking another hunk out of whoever came next. This is how the old “same old Lions” — repetitive losers, underachievers and disappointments — became the new “same old Lions” … taking it on the chin and then really getting pissed off. After getting thumped by the Buffalo Bills 48-42 in Week 15, then closing out the regular season by hammering the Chicago Bears on the road (34-17), settling a score with the San Francisco 49ers on the site of last season’s NFC title game (40-34), and then burying the Vikings with an incomprehensible defensive barrage that almost nobody believed they were capable of. And on that latter point, I mean nobody. Because the plan from Glenn was the opposite of what the Lions should have been capable of. Despite a decimated secondary and a pass rush that often had to be manufactured to consistently get pressure, Glenn decided to consistently deploy his corners in man-to-man coverage — often while running cover zero blitzes that begged to get torched. But rather than watching one of the best two-wideout tandems in the NFL feast on deep passing routes, the tactically constructed chaos sped up the clock of Vikings cornerback Sam Darnold. In turn, Darnold made mistakes. He threw too early or out of rhythm. The accuracy that made him so good all season long frayed. And with it, his wideouts struggled to escape tight coverage that had the advantage of only needing to remain sticky for a few seconds at a time. For Glenn, it was masterful, and the kind of game that will raise his profile as he fields head coaching interviews next week, during the Lions' playoff bye. That's right along with the other side of the ball and Johnson, whose balanced scheme on Sunday — utilizing his running backs, wideouts and tight end Sam LaPorta to full effect — only served to once again stamp him as the most coveted offensive tactician among the coordinators that coach-needy NFL teams will be pursuing the next few weeks. Those opportunities will be the fruits of their labor, alongside the rewards in the win/loss column that they helped provide for Campbell and the franchise. And we can slot Holmes right in the center of that equation, too, thanks to a roster that just keeps finding ways to produce. From trade deadline acquisition Za’Darius Smith at defensive end, to underrated role-fillers like defensive tackle Al-Quadin Muhammad and cornerback Amik Robertson — to foolishly maligned draft picks like running back Gibbs, linebacker Jack Campbell and safety Brian Branch. They’re all in the caravan — coaches, players, front-office executives — on the journey, believing in the possibilities of a destination that nobody really thought was achievable. On Sunday, you could have listened to Goff talk about how nothing was done yet and how this was just another item ticked off the list of goals. Or you could have absorbed Campbell talking about his pride in the moment for his assistant coaches and players. But what you really needed to do was go back to 344 days ago, when the Lions were barely removed from their season-ending loss to the 49ers. Nearly one year ago, after sleeping on it for a night and absorbing the deep hurt of that NFC title game defeat, Campbell stood in front of the media and framed the moment in a way that would foreshadow how the Lions got where they are today — locking up the No. 1 playoff seed, preparing for a trek back to the conference championship game. In truth, it’s a moment focused through last season’s failure and the declaration that came out of it. “Unfortunately,” Campbell said after the NFC title game loss, “you’ve got to live that to really understand why you’re in this business. That’s what it’s for — playoffs, NFC championship game, Super Bowl. And now your eyes are open, and our guys’ eyes are open. This should be the ultimate motivation to push forward. And it will be for us. It will be. We’ll learn and move on.” “… There’s things that we won’t have to start all the way from scratch, but there’s gotta be that hunger, there’s gotta be that work, there’s gotta be that attention to detail, there’s gotta be that urgency. In that regard, you’re starting all over again. And if you don’t — you think you’re just gonna walk out there because you went to the NFC championship game, you’ve got another thing coming. That’s how you become average in a hurry.” And 344 days and 15 regular season wins later, the Lions have not become that. If anything, they’ve gotten better — both in coaching and experience and problem-solving. And most definitely, without a doubt, in their resilience and belief in the face of anything and everything. A resolute confidence that somehow, some way, there is still a traversable path to where they’re going. Even if they have to make it as they go. Now more than ever, these are your same old Lions. Steady as they go.",195,[],2025-01-06 19:51:52,2025-01-09 00:33:41

Fed watchers expected President-elect Donald Trump to demote Barr, who was a Joe Biden appointee and a Treasury official during the Barack Obama era, although it was not clear that Trump would have had the legal power to make such a move once he took office. Barr himself said in November he wouldn’t leave as the Fed's vice chair of supervision before his term was up even if Trump tried to fire him, saying ""I intend to serve my fixed term of office."" Barr's term as vice chair for supervision was scheduled to end in July 2026. Barr backed off from that potential fight Monday, in a surprise move. However, he said that he would remain on the Fed board of governors, a separate term that doesn't end until 2032. ""I’ve determined that I would be more effective in serving the American people from my role as governor,"" he said. Barr’s decision to resign doesn't mean his boss, Fed chair Jerome Powell, will necessarily do the same. Since Trump's election win, Powell has repeatedly reinforce his intention to serve out his term as chair through May 2026, telling reporters he didn’t intend to go anywhere even if Trump tried to fire or demote him. ""Not permitted under the law,"" the central bank chair said in November when reporters asked about it. Barr's departure comes as the people in Trump’s orbit are floating some dramatic ideas that would remake the way US banks are regulated during the next Trump administration, from deleting the CFPB to abolishing the FDIC. There are lots of questions about whether any of the ideas, some of which would require acts of Congress, will come to pass. But what is clear is that certain members of the new Trump administration are considering a different regulatory approach to the financial services industry as they look to remake the federal government and slash spending. Barr has clashed with the US banking industry over a new set of controversial capital rules proposed by Barr and other top bank regulators that would require lenders to set aside greater buffers for future losses. The requirements are based on an international set of capital requirements known as Basel III imposed in the decade following the 2008 financial crisis. Banks have been fighting this US proposal for the last year in an aggressive public campaign and even dropped hints about suing regulators if they don’t get their way. They won a big victory in September when Barr and other regulators said they would water down those requirements. Some in the industry expect regulators to scrap the proposal once Trump is in office. ""If there was any doubt,"" the Basel proposal ""is dead,"" Stifel chief Washington policy strategist Brian Gardner said in a note. Fed governor Michelle Bowman, who in 2023 opposed the Basel proposal made by Barr, ""seems like the likely choice"" to become the new vice chair for supervision, Garner added. ""I stand ready to work with President Trump to ensure we have responsible financial regulators at the helm,"" Senate Banking Committee chair Tim Scott said in a statement Monday, arguing that ""Michael Barr has failed to meet the responsibilities of his position."" A longtime adviser to Trump, Stephen Moore, told Yahoo Finance Friday that replacing Barr was ""something in the mix"" as part of a second Trump term. Moore said that since Barr is in favor of raising capital requirements that’s not something the incoming administration wants ""because we'd like to see more bank lending and that would restrict bank lending or hurt the economy."" It is not clear that Trump would have had the legal power to remove Barr — or Powell, for that matter — even if he wanted to do so. That question would hinge on interpretations of Section 10 of the Federal Reserve Act. The law states that each board member shall hold office for 14 years ""unless sooner removed for cause by the President."" The question that has been debated for years is what exactly constitutes ""for cause."" The language in the law is plainly more restrictive for Fed officials when compared with the arrangements for cabinet officials and other members of a presidential administration, who are often described as working ""at the pleasure"" of the president. Legal experts have tended to say that a simple policy disagreement wouldn't rise to the level of cause, but it's a standard that hasn't been tested with a judge.

Smith School of Business. Discover More: How To Financially Plan for the New Year Under the New Trump Presidency He emphasized that “there does not appear to be a major risk of a recession in 2025.” Kass pointed to several factors that could push prices higher. “President-elect Donald Trump’s plans to implement substantial increases in tariffs, extend corporate and individual tax cuts, and deport large numbers of immigrants are likely to result in upward pressures on prices,” he explained. Jonathan Ernest, economics professor at Case Western Reserve University, warned about potential trade disruptions. “Even the threat of tariffs could lead to retaliatory tariffs, and a costly reworking of supply chains in 2025,” he noted. “Companies are less sure what their future costs will be.” Despite challenges, Kass remained optimistic about America’s standing. “The U.S. economy has been, and will likely continue, to outperform those of other countries in Asia and Europe,” he observed. While some sectors might see immediate benefits, Ernest cautioned about longer-term effects. “Implementing tariffs on China, Canada, Mexico and or other trading partners may help bolster production in some U.S. industries in the short run,” he explained, “but it is likely to lead to higher levels of inflation as inputs and labor costs rise.” Editor’s note on political coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

Park spokesman Tony Clark confirms that the large family climbing attraction that was the centerpiece of the Forbidden Frontier on Adventure Island is being removed. The themed area of the park has been closed since the end of the 2022 season after just a four-year run. Cedar Point has used the isolated wooded area in the heart of the lakefront park for a Halloween haunt in recent years. Clark declined to say whether the structure is being moved to another Six Flags park. The move follows the closure of the nearby Snake River Falls water ride and Professor Delbert's Frontier Fling last season. ""Future plans for that structure, along with any development on the island, will be released at a later date,"" Clark said. For now this off season, Cedar Point is focusing its energy on the construction of a new roller coaster and working out the kinks to get another one up and running. Clark said construction continues on Siren's Curse billed as the tallest, fastest and longest “tilt” roller coaster in America. The roller coaster – designed by Netherlands firm Vekoma – takes thrill seekers up a 160-foot-tall lift hill where from the ground it appears they encounter a broken track that trails off to nowhere. Clark said the next big milestone will be the addition of the tilt track onto the tower. The exact timing of that is not set just yet, but the goal is to have the coaster ready for riders in time for this season. And work continues to get the Top Thrill 2 roller coaster back up and running. The much-anticipated revamp of the Top Thrill Dragster made its debut at the start of the 2024 season but closed abruptly after just a few days for retooling and never reopened.

But though he vowed to stay on as Liberal Party leader - despite deepening frustrations amongst voters and a political rival surging in the polls - even the self-described ""fighter"" could not withstand the growing chorus of members of his own party calling for him to resign. ""This country deserves a real choice in the next election, and it has become clear to me that if I'm having to fight internal battles, I cannot be the best option in that election,"" Trudeau conceded on Monday, announcing his resignation in front of Rideau Cottage, his official residence for most of the last decade. He will stay on as prime minister until a new Liberal Party leader is chosen, at a date yet to be set by the party. Follow developments live Who might replace Trudeau as Liberal Party leader? Trudeau swept to power nearly a decade ago, heralded as the fresh face of progressive politics. In 2015, swayed by his youthful charisma and a hopeful political message, voters catapulted the Liberals from a third-place party to holding a majority of seats in parliament - unprecedented in Canadian political history. Now, he remains the only leader left standing among peers when he came into office, from Barack Obama to Angela Merkel, Shinzo Abe and David Cameron, and is currently the longest-serving leader in the G7. But in the years since his ascent to the global stage, and over two general elections, Trudeau and his brand have become a drag on the party's fortunes. Paul Wells, a Canadian political journalist and the author of Justin Trudeau on the Ropes, recently told the BBC he believes Trudeau will be remembered ""as a consequential"" prime minister, notably for providing genuine leadership on issues like indigenous reconciliation and, to some extent, climate policy. But he is also one ""who felt increasingly out of touch with public opinion and was increasingly unable to adjust to changing times"". A series of ethics scandals began to take the sheen off the new government - he was found to have violated federal conflict of interest rules in the handling of a corruption inquiry – the SNC-Lavalin affair - and for luxury trips to the Bahamas. In 2020, he faced scrutiny for picking a charity with ties to his family to manage a major government programme. In a general election in 2019, his party was reduced to a minority status, meaning the Liberals had to rely on the support of other parties to stay in power. A snap election in 2021 did not improve their fortunes. More recently, Trudeau faced headwinds from cost of living increases and inflation that have contributed to election upsets around the world. And after more than nine years in power, he is among Canada's longest serving prime ministers, and there is a general sense of fatigue and frustration with his government. The writing was on the wall. Over the summer, voters rejected Liberal candidates in a handful of special elections in once-safe Liberal seats, leading to the beginning of internal party unrest. Public opinion polls also reached new depths. A survey conducted over the holidays by the Angus Reid Institute suggested the lowest level of support for the party in their tracking, dating back to 2014. But the shock resignation of his key deputy, former Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, in mid-December proved to be the final straw, as members of his own party made it clear they no longer supported his leadership.",1,[],2025-01-06 19:55:15,2025-01-06 19:55:15
https://www.yahoo.com/news/four-missing-kenyan-youths-freed-151551991.html,Five missing Kenyan youths freed amid uproar over abductions,,World,BBC,4 min read,"More than 80 young Kenyans have gone missing in recent months, with many blaming the security forces.","Basillioh Rukanga & Anita Nkonge - BBC News, Nairobi",2025-01-06T18:05:45.000Z,"Five young Kenyan men - including a popular cartoonist - who went missing just before the Christmas holidays have been found alive, family members and rights groups say. Kenya has been gripped by a wave of disappearances, with the state-funded rights group saying that over 80 people have been abducted in the last six months. The abductions generally target government critics and are widely believed to be the work of security agents, although the authorities have not admitted responsibility. They began in June last year during nationwide anti-tax protests, but increased in December, when AI-generated photos of the president in a coffin were widely shared. The youth-led protests forced President William Ruto to withdraw a series of planned tax rises and shook his government, leaving his authority badly undermined. Kibet Bull, known for his silhouette cartoon memes critical of the president, announced his release on Monday afternoon on X to much fanfare. He told his 105,000 followers that he had been dropped off in the town of Luanda, nearly 370 km (229 miles) from the capital, Nairobi, where he was last seen in December. Kibet Bull said straight after he was released he went to a disco. His mother told the BBC she ""rejoiced"" after she heard the news that her son had returned. ""I gave him a call and we talked, we didn't talk much, the moment he told me 'I am Kibet' and I heard his voice, I screamed, I celebrated until he hung up,"" she said. Kenya protesters traumatised by abductions - lawyer Ruto's humbling shows power of African youth The others released on Monday include 24-year-old student Billy Mwangi in Embu, in the central Mount Kenya region. Local MP Gitonga Mukunji told journalists that Mr Mwangi ""was whipped and beaten while in a dark room. He is traumatised."" Mr Mwangi's father said his son was not able to discuss what he had gone through adding that he had been taken to hospital. ""He came home around eight in the morning. He walked by himself - his mother and I saw him. We thank everyone who has prayed and supported him,"" he told the Daily Nation news site. Last week, Mr Mwangi's father broke down in court as he pleaded for his son to be released. A relative of 22-year-old Peter Muteti, who was seized in Nairobi, on 21 December, told the BBC on Monday that he had been reunited with the family but was disoriented and unable to speak about the ordeal. Amnesty International Kenya welcomed the releases and urged ""the State to free all abductees and hold those responsible accountable"". Two weeks ago the police denied responsibility for the abductions carried out by men in plain clothes across the country, some of which were captured on CCTV. Rights groups and other Kenyans have linked the abductions to a shadowy intelligence and counter-terrorism unit of the security forces. Amid the public uproar, President Ruto said last month: ""We are going to stop the abductions so that our youth can live peacefully and have discipline"", while urging parents to take care of their children. Until now, no-one had been freed since he spoke on 27 December, with activists planning protests on Monday to push the government to act. On Monday the police released an update acknowledging the freeing of the men, saying they were already in contact with one of the abductees, Bernard Kavuli, who had presented himself at a police station. The police said investigations into all cases of missing people were under way. One other man - Ronny Kiplangat – has also been released, his family told local media. Mr Kavuli, a content creator, was seized on the outskirts of Nairobi in December, while Mr Kiplangat is the brother of Kibet Bull. Two others were seized after posting AI-generated images of the president. At least 24 people are still missing. The Law Society of Kenya has filed a legal case against the state, demanding the immediate and unconditional release of seven individuals abducted last month, including those who have now been released. The situation continues to stoke fear across the country, with parents worried about the safety of their children and activists vowing to maintain pressure until all missing persons are accounted for.

Trudeau, 53, has led the Liberal Party for 11 years and was celebrated by many progressives around the world as a beacon of hope when he became prime minister in November 2015. He is credited with leading Canada forward on issues like the climate crisis, gender equality and reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. But several political scandals, such as suppressed corruption investigations, tarnished his image at time when Canada's economy was also struggling. Criticism of the prime minister has increased sharply of late, with people accusing him of failing to contain high prices or provide enough housing in the country. The New Democratic Party, with which the Liberal Party had previously worked to pass legislation, withdrew its support in him in September and threatened a vote of no confidence. Trudeau's minority government was then dealt a major blow by the resignation last month of finance minister Chrystia Freeland after the two close allies clashed over economic policy. A general election must be held in Canada by October 20, but an early election could be forced, for example by a vote of no confidence.

Andrew Dunham, from Telford-based McPhillips, said The Heart of Africa project had been ""really, really interesting"". He also said it had posed some different challenges, including working around the other animals living at the site. The new area will feature animals commonly seen in the African savannah and is due to open later this year. Mr Dunham said his company had worked with the Dogs Trust before and had built a conservation breeding management area for Chester Zoo in 2018. But he said the new zoo attraction was ""something new to us"". McPhillips had originally bid for the contract during the coronavirus pandemic, which delayed the start of work. Mr Dunham said construction eventually started in March 2023 and was completed in December last year. The company designed and built 14 new buildings and animal habitats, based around an open ""savannah"" area which will feature animals including giraffes, zebras, antelopes and ostriches. There will also be 51 lodges around a central lake, where visitors can stay. Mr Dunham said that while most of the materials used were fairly normal, the design team had needed to take the animals into consideration. That meant no rubber seals around doors, for instance, in case the animals were tempted to chew them. ""We had a really tight working relationship with all the animal teams,"" he said. The construction workers also had to be careful not to disturb the existing animals. Among other things, that meant no cranes because ""a change in the skyline might distress them"". With work complete, the zoo was now starting to introduce animals to their new habitats, he said, to get them familiar with it before it opened to the public.

""The last hour of the 'firewall' will soon come for us too,"" said Weidel. Austrian President Alexander van der Bellen officially tasked the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) with forming a government on Monday after meeting its leader Herbert Kickl. The decision came after Christian Stocker, the newly designated leader of the conservative Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), said on Sunday that his party is prepared to engage in negotiations with Kickl, months after the FPÖ won parliamentary elections. Stocker was appointed by his party after Chancellor Karl Nehammer announced his resignation on Saturday following the collapse of previous coalition negotiations with centrist parties. The CDU and its sister party in Bavaria, the Christian Social Union, have consistently ruled out cooperating with the AfD should the opportunity arise following next month's early elections in Germany. However, Weidel said the success of the FPÖ - which the AfD sees as a ""sister party"" - should serve as a warning to Friedrich Merz, the CDU/CSU candidate for chancellor. Weidel said voters do not want coalitions ""in which left-wing parties set the tone"" if the CDU/CSU and AfD have a majority of seats in parliament. Bavarian premier concerned Bavarian Premier Markus Söder, who leads the CSU, said on Monday that he is concerned about the developments in neighbouring Austria. ""First of all, it is a decision for Austria itself,"" said Söder. ""But the development is of course not good."" Söder warned that the rise of the FPÖ is proof that coalitions between conservative and Green parties ultimately only strengthen extremist forces. Austria has been governed by a coalition between the conservative Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and the Austrian Greens since 2020. Söder also pointed out that the FPÖ has a different tradition to the AfD. The FPÖ is in government in many Austrian states and has been the junior partner in previous national coalitions.

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni came to power two years ago with the promise to stem the arrival of refugees to the country, and her government has taken a hard-line approach to migration since then.

Similar agreements with other North African countries are in the pipeline. However, large numbers of people continue to perish during the dangerous sea crossing to Europe. More than 2,200 refugees drowned or were reported missing in the Mediterranean last year, the United Nations reported, although it is feared that the actual figures are higher.

U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman also agreed to impose sanctions, which he said he will decide on later. “Discovery is not supposed to be a shell game where the hidden ball is moved around and around,” Liman said while announcing his ruling Monday. During his hourslong testimony on Friday, the first day of the hearing, Giuliani told Liman that he was not purposefully withholding his assets, but instead was disorganized about his matters and uncertain about some of the valuables he owns. He testified that he did not know the location of his signed Joe DiMaggio jersey, for example, saying the last time he saw it was in New York City in September. “Since it’s missing, I can’t tell you when it would have been moved,” he told an attorney for Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss in court on Friday. Giuliani continued his testimony remotely at Monday’s hearing. During Friday’s proceedings, Freeman and Moss’ attorney, Meryl Conant Governski, said her clients were more interested in recovering assets they were owed than pursuing a contempt order. The Georgia women’s legal team has accused Giuliani of repeatedly obstructing the handover of assets to satisfy the nearly $150 million defamation judgment. Giuliani has blown past multiple deadlines to surrender his properties, and the women’s attorneys say they have received only a fraction of what they are owed. Giuliani, 80, has repeatedly argued that he has turned over what he could and that he didn’t know where all of his assets are, a claim that Liman has called “farcical.” Giuliani also has said that the efforts to seize control of his assets have caused him to struggle to pay his bills.

The Kentucky Supreme Court announced Monday afternoon that investitures scheduled this week for incoming Chief Justice Debra Lambert and Justice Pamela Goodwine will be rescheduled at a later date. Both were officially sworn in last month and hold their new judicial seats. Lambert, whose investiture was slated for Tuesday, is Kentucky’s first female chief justice. Goodwine’s investiture was scheduled for Friday. She became the first Black woman elected to the high court in November. Additionally, justices on the court were set to hear oral arguments in three cases on Tuesday and Wednesday of this week, but those have been canceled and will be rescheduled. Meanwhile, the General Assembly must open its 2025 legislative session on Tuesday. The Kentucky Constitution requires the legislature to convene on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in January. Both the House and Senate will meet at noon on Tuesday. In a press briefing about the weather Monday morning, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear said he anticipated state office buildings to open Tuesday, along with most businesses across the state. However, he urged Kentuckians to “plan extra time for your commute tomorrow.” Beshear said he provided Republican House Speaker David Osborne and Republican Senate President Robert Stivers with information about the storm, which has been named Winter Storm Blair, and added they were considering the safety of lawmakers this week. The governor had declared a state of emergency for Kentucky over the weekend ahead of the storm. Kentucky communities have seen several inches of snow and some ice across Sunday and Monday. The governor’s office said 93,400 people were without power as of Monday morning, but that number was fluctuating.

New updates were released Monday afternoon regarding the NPU employee injured from a boiler at NPU’s wastewater treatment plant Sunday. Riley said the employee suffered non-life-threatening injuries from the incident and was able to leave Backus Hospital Sunday afternoon. “We are very optimistic that he will make a full recovery before too long,” Riley said Monday afternoon. The investigation into the incident’s cause is underway. Riley said there was a meeting at the wastewater treatment plant Monday morning, which was attended by NPU, their safety consultant, the Connecticut Department of Labor’s Division of Occupational Safety and Health as well as the State of Connecticut’s Boiler Inspector. According to Riley, NPU is conducting its own investigation of the incident, which will include an audit of all the equipment that was involved and conversations with NPU employees, the boiler’s manufacturer and any contractors who have provided maintenance on the boiler.

Reilly,2025-01-06T21:34:43.000Z,"WASHINGTON — Enrique Tarrio, the former Proud Boys chairman who is serving 22 years in federal prison after he was convicted of seditious conspiracy in relation to the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, is asking President-elect Donald Trump for a presidential pardon. Nayib Hassan, Tarrio’s lawyer, wrote a letter to Trump on the fourth anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack asking for “a full and complete Presidential Pardon” from the president-elect who has vowed to pardon some rioters after he takes office on Jan. 20. In the letter, Hassan called the 42-year-old Tarrio a “young man with an aspiring future ahead of him” who was “portrayed throughout the Government’s case as a right-wing extremist that promoted a neo-fascist militant organization” when, Hassan claimed, Tarrio is ""nothing more than a proud American that believes in true conservative values.” Tarrio was one of four members of the far-right Proud Boys group found guilty of seditious conspiracy in May 2023. He received 22 years in prison, the longest Jan. 6 sentence to date, though he was not in Washington for the attack itself. He had been arrested and ordered to stay away from the capital city and was convicted of planning and organizing Proud Boys members to assault the Capitol in the lead-up to Jan. 6. Attorney General Merrick Garland said after their sentencing that Tarrio and his fellow Proud Boys played a ""central role"" in leading the Jan. 6 mob to breach the Capitol. At Tarrio's trial, Hassan had blamed Trump for his client's and other Proud Boys' actions, reminding jurors that Trump said his supporters should “fight like hell” or they were not “going to have a country anymore. He also argued that Trump telling the Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by” during a 2020 presidential debate brought so much attention to the group that “vetting became difficult."" Tarrio was arrested in connection with a separate event — the December 2020 burning of a Black Lives Matter banner — just before the Jan. 6 attack. The top intelligence official in the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington was convicted two weeks ago of leaking information to Tarrio, telling him just before Jan. 6, 2021, that there was a warrant out in Washington for his arrest. As a result, Tarrio watched Jan. 6 unfold from, as Hassan said at trial, from a “hotel in Baltimore.” More than 1,580 defendants have been charged and 1,270 defendants convicted in connection with the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. Trump has not given specifics about how many or what categories of defendants he plans to pardon. In a December interview with NBC News' ""Meet the Press,"" Trump did not rule out pardoning rioters who assaulted law enforcement. Trump's transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tarrio's request for a pardon.

The wolf died from starvation after it was shot and had to drag itself to a water source without the use of its back legs, according to the agency. Another deceased wolf, an adult female, was found Oct. 20 southwest of Twisp in Okanogan County. The department began investigating the death of another adult male wolf in Klickitat County on Dec. 17. The wolf was killed northeast of Trout Lake and was the last remaining member of the Big Muddy Pack, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. In total, five wolves were illegally killed in Washington last year, according to the agency. Four of the deaths are still under active investigation. Under state law, killing an endangered species can result in up to $5,000 in fines and one year in jail. Anyone who knowingly violates the federal Endangered Species Act can face up to one year in prison and up to $50,000 in fines.

(Provided/Mac Stone, Southwings) COLUMBIA — Four new state parks could open in 2025, if the state parks department receives the $18 million it has requested from the state Legislature. The planned parks would join 48 the Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism already operates, only two of which have opened in the past two decades. But the agency needs $18 million to pull off the work needed to make the properties public, according to its budget request for 2025-26. The most recent state park to open was May Forest, a former convent on James Island that became public in October 2023. Before that, the state hadn’t made a new park public since H. Cooper Black Jr. Memorial Field Trial and Recreation Area joined the list in 2006. The failed V.C. Summer nuclear power plant is one reason for the sudden boom in parks. SC could expand popular Upstate park and create new preserve nearer NC border After Dominion Energy bought out SCANA in 2019, it agreed to donate four properties to the state that had once served as retreats for utility workers and their families. That 2021 settlement with the state Department of Revenue offset about one-third of the $165 million the utility owed in unpaid taxes, which would have been forgiven if the nuclear plant expansion had been completed. One, Bundrick Island on Lexington County’s Lake Murray, went to the Department of Natural Resources to manage. The other three — Pine Island in Lexington County, Ramsey Grove in Georgetown County and Misty Lake in Aiken County — account for three of the four state parks that could open this year, according to the state parks department. The agency also hopes to open properties it has acquired along the Black River in Georgetown and Williamsburg counties while continuing to expand along the riverfront. The $18 million price tag to open the parks would fund repairs and renovations to existing buildings on the properties, as well as construction of campsites, cabins, boat ramps, visitors’ centers, trails and other amenities, according to the request. Some of those projects are underway, with the help of $10 million over the past two years spent on park development. Without the extra money, however, the department might have to push back opening dates, some of which have already been delayed, according to the request. “These projects, once completed, will create new state park experiences that will generate additional revenue for the State Parks Service and provide direct economic benefit to the parks’ surrounding business communities,” the request reads. The department does not have firm opening dates yet for the new parks, since the money needed to complete the projects is still pending. When the parks department received Misty Lake from Dominion in 2022, the plan was to open a day-use park for hiking, fishing and picnicking, which rangers from nearby parks would oversee. After beginning to plan, though, officials decided they wanted to add overnight camping to the 192-acre property. While camping can drive extra revenue to a state park, it also requires extra planning. In addition to needing campsites, parks with people staying the night need a ranger to live on the property to take care of issues that arise outside of normal operating hours, department spokeswoman Sam Queen said. SC planning to preserve 1,000-acre Central Park of Spartanburg Because of that, along with some administrative holdups, the department pushed the opening back from 2024 to 2025. The agency has started the process of building offices, buildings and a shop at Misty Lake. In the meantime, work has begun to repair the onsite 6,200-square-foot clubhouse, which utility employees once used for retreats. Once construction dates are finalized, the department can set an opening date, Queen said. Originally slated to open in 2023, the 27-acre Pine Island had its opening date pushed back twice after a traffic study took longer than anticipated. Neighbors near the island, located on Lexington County’s Lake Murray, had raised concerns about increases in noise and traffic if people started visiting. Officials pushed forward, telling residents they would work with local law enforcement to control traffic, The Post and Courier reported at the time. Then, in April, a fire at the park manager’s residence building halted progress again. Much of the work that needed to be done, including renovating the house already on the property, required a park manager on the property for oversight. Without anywhere to live, that was no longer possible, Queen said. Damage from Hurricane Helene, which hit the state as a tropical storm in September, knocked trees and limbs onto picnic shelters and across the island, adding cleanup time and pushing the date back again to 2025. Fire remediation and construction are almost complete, and the department is hoping to hire a manager soon to live on the property, Queen said. Once a manager is hired and moved in, the department can set an opening date, she said. Some hikers have already had a chance to visit the 2,600-acre Ramsey Grove. Park rangers hosted several special hikes on the property during 2024 as a preview of what to expect from the Georgetown County property, another former retreat for utility staff. State park to include new kind of overnight camping for SC Work to complete the park is still underway. Park employees are improving the road leading into the park and upgrading the water system, Queen said. The department also plans to build more trails and repair the clubhouse on site, including removing lead paint, she said. That work could potentially cost about $10 million, according to a plan the department submitted to the state. Once the agency has a better timeline for when work will be funded and completed, it can set an opening date, Queen said. Parts of the Black River park, a patchwork of properties that line the river, are already accessible. The parks department plans to add at least some of its own 3,600 acres to that list this year, Queen said. Officials have been adding bathrooms, trails and boat launches onto its land, preparing the properties for people to use, officials said previously. New tour brings more visitors to Turner House as SC parks agency looks to boost rentals While parts of the park could open this year, the work isn’t done. The department plans to continue expanding until there’s enough public property along the riverfront that a kayaker could start a day trip from any given boat ramp, according to the department’s website. The parks department is planning for two more state parks to join the slate in coming years. Dearborn Island in Chester County has a tentative opening date of 2027. Before the agency can open up access, Duke Energy, which is leasing the land to the state, must build a pedestrian bridge so that visitors can access the river island from nearby Great Falls. Also on the docket in the coming years is a new 600-acre park in Lancaster County focused on the Catawba Nation’s culture and history. Nonprofit Open Space Institute bought the land in 2023 with plans to transfer it to the state this year, Queen said. Department officials plan to return to the Legislature next year with a specific request to fund the park’s opening, according to this year’s budget request.",0,[],2025-01-06 22:58:15,2025-01-06 22:58:15

Holstein, retired judge and former chief justice of the Supreme Court of Missouri, died Dec. 31 in Springfield. He was 79.","Claudette Riley, Springfield News-Leader",2025-01-06T21:26:42.000Z,"John C. Holstein, retired judge and former chief justice of the Supreme Court of Missouri, died Dec. 31 at his home in Springfield. He was 79. A celebration of his life is scheduled for Jan. 8 at Second Baptist Church in Springfield. The visitation will start at 10 a.m. with a service to follow at noon. In 2022, Holstein was inducted into the Springfield Public Schools Hall of Fame. “My colleagues at the Supreme Court of Missouri and I are saddened by the loss of Judge Holstein,” Chief Justice Mary R. Russell said in a Monday news release. “As a treasured member of the judiciary, he exemplified integrity, and his leadership was steady and dignified. He leaves a remarkable legacy of service, not only as a judge but also as a beacon of hope for the vulnerable and as a steadfast advocate for the welfare of children. Judge Holstein’s dedication to public service and legal education has inspired countless individuals to pursue the noble path of justice."" Russell added: ""Personally, I was fortunate to be the beneficiary of his kindness and advice when I joined this court. My colleagues and I offer our deepest sympathies to his entire family.” The Springfield native graduated from Parkview High School in 1963, earned a bachelor's degree in political science at Missouri State University, a law degree from the University of Missouri-Columbia School of Law. Later, while serving on the court, he earned a master's degree in letters of the law from the University of Virginia. Commissioned in 1969, Holstein also served his country on active duty in the U.S. Army, Army Reserve and National Guard. He retired in 1997 at the rank of lieutenant colonel. He began his legal career in 1970 in a West Plains law firm. He was a trial judge for 12 years, beginning as a magistrate and probate judge in 1975 in Howell County. In 1978, he was elected associate circuit judge in Howell County. Four years later, he was elected circuit judge of the 37th Judicial Circuit, which then included Carter, Howell, Oregon and Shannon counties. As the circuit’s sole circuit judge, he also served as presiding judge. During his time as a trial judge, Holstein presided over a wide range of cases, from traffic tickets and small claims disputes to capital murder cases and civil cases with millions of dollars in dispute. He was appointed to the Missouri Court of Appeals, Southern District, in 1987 by then-Gov. John Ashcroft. Two years later, Ashcroft appointed Holstein to the Supreme Court of Missouri. He served as Missouri’s chief justice from July 1995 through June 1997. During his time as an appellate judge, Holstein participated in more than 1,500 reported cases and wrote approximately 300 majority or separate opinions. Holsten retired from the court in March 2002 after nearly 27 years of judicial service at every level of the state’s court system. In announcing his judicial retirement, Holstein said: “It has been a great honor to serve the people of Missouri. … I have only two goals for the future: the first is to find an area of the law where there is a need and try to fill it; the second is to remain active in continuing to build the professionalism of Missouri attorneys. I’ve been blessed by my association with the excellent lawyers and great judges of this state. I want that to continue.” After that, Holstein returned to private practice with the Springfield firm Shughart, Thompson & Kilroy (now Polsinelli). From 2015 to 2023, he focused his work on mediation and arbitration, providing alternative dispute resolution for legal issues. He was also active in the community, serving as a founding member and chairperson of the Central States Judicial Council on Child Support Enforcement and helping to raise funds for Legal Services of Southwest Missouri. Holstein is survived by his wife of more than 57 years, the former Mary Brummel; their three daughters and sons-in-law; and 12 grandchildren. A private burial is scheduled for Jan. 9 at the Missouri State Veterans Cemetery in Springfield. In lieu of flowers, Holstein's family suggests memorial contributions may be made to the Pregnancy Care Center in Springfield.

Asif Merchant has been locked up in the Special Administrative Measures, or SAMS, unit, on the eighth floor of the Sunset Park federal jail, since his arrest in July because federal officials fear he may pass information to his Iranian handlers or other potential killers on the outside. Security is extremely tight — his food gets passed through a slot, correction officers aren’t allowed to open his cell door without a supervisor present, and lawyer meetings take place across a wall of thick glass. But his lawyer, Avraham Moskowitz, says the conditions he’s held in go far beyond precaution and “are arbitrary and capricious and designed solely to make Mr. Merchant’s life at the MDC more miserable.” Merchant has been barred from buying a sweatshirt or sweatpants from the jail commissary, and his lawyer and family members haven’t been allowed to send him one, even through Amazon or another retailer recognized by the jail, his lawyer said in a letter to Judge Eric Komitee. “Mr. Merchant’s cell … is very cold and he often comes to attorney-client meetings shivering from cold,” Moskowitz said. “On the one occasion when Mr. Merchant was brought to the courthouse to meet with me and review discovery, he was so cold that he wore my winter coat throughout the meeting so he could warm up.” At a Brooklyn Federal Court hearing Monday, Bureau of Prisons lawyer Sophia Papapetru said that a check on Friday showed his cell’s temperature was 69 degrees, and that he had thermals to wear. Papapetru attended the hearing virtually, because of “pre-existing conflicts and the risk of inclement weather,” according to a filing by prosecutors. “I can only describe what I’m experiencing, which is he comes in and he’s chattering, and obviously that’s a real problem,” Moskowitz said. Papapetru said she was “digging a little deeper” into why sweats aren’t on the commissary list for SAMS inmates. As for his food, Merchant was getting halal meals, but they made him ill, so he was allowed to switch to a vegetarian menu, the lawyer writes. But MDC staff won’t let him have salt and pepper, or any other spices to make his food bearable. “These restrictions make no sense and certainly are not based on any security needs,” Moskowitz said. When Papapetru said Merchant bought salt and pepper from the commissary on Dec. 19, the defense lawyer said, “It was brought to him and then immediately taken back, and he was told he’s not entitled to have it.” Papapetru said she would “look into that.” Outside the courtroom, Merchant’s lawyer said the correction officers offered no hint as to why they’d bring him the seasoning, only to tell him he couldn’t have it. “There’s no real interaction,” he told the Daily News. “He doesn’t speak to anybody all day. They open the slot, they give it to him, or they don’t.” The jail, which currently houses rap star Sean “Diddy” Combs as he awaits trial for sex trafficking and alleged CEO killer Luigi Mangione, has long been decried for its hellish conditions by judges, defense attorneys and inmates. Earlier this year, two inmates were stabbed to death just six weeks apart. Merchant, a 46-year-old Pakinstani national, admitted he was recruited and trained by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp., or the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, according to a memo by Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco included in Moskowitz’s filing. That training included “countersurveillance and other espionage tactics,” and he contacted his Iranian handler communicated through messages hidden in gift bags taken by others to Pakistan, and through encrypted phone app messages to a family member who served as a go-between, according to the memo. Merchant is accused of trying to hire a hit man as part of a multiphase plot culminating in August or September. Though the criminal complaint against Merchant does not name the politician he wanted to kill, he floated Trump’s name as a potential target, a law enforcement source confirmed in August. Iranian government officials have long wanted revenge for the death of one of the regime’s generals, Qasem Soleimani, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad on Jan. 3, 2020 during Trump’s first term in office. All Merchant’s training and tradecraft couldn’t stop him from making some dire errors, though — the person he reached out to for help with the plot when he came to the U.S. in April turned out to be a federal informant, and the two “hit men” he tried to hire in June were actually feds, according to court documents. Merchant, who’s charged with attempted terrorism and murder-for-hire, could face life in prison if convicted.",1,[],2025-01-06 22:58:15,2025-01-06 22:58:15

https://www.yahoo.com/news/indianapolis-organizations-try-keep-homeless-212435095.html,How Indianapolis organizations try to keep homeless safe amid winter storm and cold,,US,Indianapolis Star,4 min read,Shelters and city employees offer temporary housing and resources to those experiencing homelessness.,"Bradley Hohulin, Indianapolis Star",2025-01-06T21:24:35.000Z,"As Indianapolis-area residents respond to the winter storm that has brought more than half a foot of snow to much of Central Indiana, few people are more vulnerable than those experiencing homelessness. With the National Weather Service's storm warning lasting into Monday evening, multiple Indianapolis organizations are working to keep the city's homeless population safe. Several Indianapolis-area shelters are open to individuals and families in need of a place to stay. Wheeler Mission, the area's largest shelter provider, has cots and floor mats available to accommodate visitors beyond its normal capacity as part of a ""Winter Contingency Plan"" in partnership with the Coalition for Homelessness Prevention and City of Indianapolis. Senior Director of Community Relations and Development Brian Crispin told IndyStar Monday that the Wheeler Mission Shelter for Men (SFM) had filled its 250-bed capacity but that roughly half of its 100 overflow mats were still available. The Center for Women and Children is presently at capacity for families, but Crispin said there are many beds available for single women. In addition to sleeping accommodations, occupants at both Wheeler shelters receive lunch and dinner administered by full-time staff and volunteers. While the Center for Women and Children saw a small influx of about 10 extra people Sunday night, the SFM has maintained fairly even occupancy since the contingency plan, which runs through the end of March, started in November. Many of those whom Wheeler cannot admit can seek shelter at the former site of Susan Leach School 68 on the east side, which Crispin said has limited spaces available. While Wheeler was well-prepared for the storm, staffing and resource management remain a challenge, Crispin said. ""Obviously, it's a drain on our staff,"" he said. ""Volunteers are typically unable to get to our shelters to help on a day like this, so our staff picks up the pieces on that as well."" Wheeler also goes through food and money much faster during the winter since more people come in for meals so the shelter has to pay staffers overtime. Crispin said donations of food, clothing, toiletries and money, as well as time, are hugely helpful to Wheeler this time of year. ""You're right in front of people who are experiencing homelessness, serving them a meal,"" Crispin said. ""So it's a great experience, but it's also helpful to us."" Elsewhere in Indianapolis, others experiencing homelessness occupy outdoor camps, trying to keep warm with tents, blankets and layered clothing. On a snowy day like Monday, IMPD Officer Phil Smiley and his fellow patrolmen on the IMPD Homeless Unit rumble along sludge-smeared streets in massive Ford F-150 trucks to deliver supplies like water bottles, blankets, boots and hand warmers to people at those camps. While Smiley said it appeared Monday that most of the camps' populace had relocated to shelters, some remained in their makeshift homes. People at the camps might stay put due to a distrust of shelters, aversion to a shelter's religious affiliation or because shelters do not allow them to use a drug on which they have a dependency, Smiley said. Nevertheless, Smiley and the rest of the Homeless Unit — comprised of one sergeant and three patrolmen split into two teams — encourage people at the camps to go to a shelter. Smiley said among the people choosing to remain at the camps, most appear to have heating sources to ward off the cold. As of Monday morning, the Homeless Unit had not had to transport anyone at a camp to a hospital. Still, the need to locate those in dire condition looms over the four-person squad. ""We can drive all over the place, but unless somebody directs us to a place we're not always gonna find everybody,"" Smiley said. ""And that's what really bothers us — someone suffering or passing away needlessly."" Both Smiley and Crispin emphasized the importance of people experiencing homeless to seek refuge at a professional shelter as well as shelters' need for money and goods. Indianapolis has multiple emergency shelters for individuals and families. You can find a list of them here. If you wish to donate to an emergency shelter, most accept monetary donations on their websites and offer information on how to donate physical goods. This page also includes a list of warming centers. For updates on which warming centers are open, you can check Indy Parks and Recreation's Facebook page.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/republicans-still-stuck-carry-trumps-212325845.html,Republicans still stuck on how to carry out Trump's agenda,,Politics,Semafor,5 min read,"They may need him to break the impasse — for real, this time.",Burgess Everett,2025-01-06T21:23:25.000Z,"Congressional Republicans are all over the place on how to enact Donald Trump’s border and tax plans. They may need Trump to break the logjam — for good, this time. For a few hours over the weekend, it appeared Trump had made a choice in Congress’ impasse over his agenda, seeming to side with the House’s preference for one big catch-all party-line rather than the Senate’s two-step strategy. Then the president-elect made another media appearance on Monday morning that revealed he doesn’t feel that strongly about the whole row, “as long as we get something passed as quickly as possible.” Trump’s ambivalence effectively threw the matter back to House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune to figure out. And it’s a less esoteric problem than it looks: Until the House and Senate can agree on a shared blueprint, they’ll keep losing time to accomplish the new administration’s biggest goals. Republicans are already behind their 2017 pace when it comes to preparing for party-line legislation that can dodge a filibuster. “We still need a plan,” said Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, the top tax writer in his chamber, who is doing as much advance legwork as he can to prepare for debate over extending the GOP’s 2017 tax cuts. (He is officially neutral on whether to write one or two bills, for the record.) At the moment, party leaders are plotting out different scenarios, quietly tinkering with potential legislation and preparing for a laborious effort. Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said Republicans will meet soon with Trump to hash out the matter. And unless one path can win the day, Trump will take office with Congress still stuck in the mud. “We’ve just got to just get together and start doing it, but we’ve got to communicate. You know, we didn’t communicate on that immigration bill,” Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., told Semafor, referring to the bipartisan border deal that Trump ended up opposing and killing in Congress last year. “That turned into a disaster.” The GOP debate over how to act on border security and prevent Trump’s first-term tax cuts from expiring is a case study in how the congressional process affects legislative success. Budget committees first have to design the party’s plans to conform to strict rules in order to avoid a Democratic filibuster in the Senate; it’s a task that requires close coordination between the two chambers. Despite Trump’s second win being far less surprising, that coordination hasn’t exactly materialized yet. Back in 2017, both chambers of Congress passed budgets that set up a party-line effort to repeal Obamacare before Trump was even sworn in. But eight years later, Senate Republicans are still laying the groundwork for launching a two-part, border-then-taxes GOP agenda, according to people familiar with their plan. Thune devised that plan in December, getting buy-in from many senators, as well as some Trump allies and top aides. House members and other senators are wary of that strategy, however, arguing that a delay in taking up tax cuts — which are a higher priority for Congress — would put those cuts at risk of failing in a closely divided House. Thune’s No. 4 Senate GOP leader Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., said a key factor is “whatever the House thinks it can pass.” She said she could support either a one- or two-bill plan. “The question is: Which strategy has a higher probability of success?” said Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind. “I personally don’t have strong views on that. I’m inclined to follow our own leader, John Thune.” Trump is expected to hold a series of meetings with lawmakers in the coming days as Johnson, Thune and the White House attempt to agree on one broad approach. If they ultimately gravitate to a one-bill strategy, it’s likely to take well into the spring to pass. A border-only bill, the Senate GOP thinking goes, could pass by February or March. Senate Budget Committee Chair Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., is still aligned with Thune’s two-bill plan, arguing that quick movement on immigration would be better for national security. “I’m in the camp of cutting taxes and border security. But the threat levels I see, I think it would be smart to increase military spending and give the money Trump needs to deport people and secure the border early on,” Graham said. Barrasso said on Monday after a Republican leadership meeting that the two-part strategy “makes the president happy, it makes the base happy, and improves, clearly, the security in the nation.” But he acknowledged the “House is afraid they can’t get two [bills] passed,” and Graham also said more discussions are needed. Just a few weeks ago, Trump dismantled weeks of work on a government spending bill in a single social media post. The same thing could happen, seemingly at any moment, to the GOP’s planned agenda on border security and taxes. If Trump continues his relatively neutral stance, Johnson and Thune will have to work it out among themselves. But even though each GOP leader attended the other chamber’s recent retreat to try to get in sync, the president-elect’s unclear position is making that job harder. Perhaps Republicans’ impending meetings with Trump will put the argument behind them.",0,[],2025-01-06 22:58:15,2025-01-06 22:58:15

Rebecca Westergaard, 75, of Pataskala, died after being attacked by two pigs that were roaming near her Mink Street home, Pataskala Police Chief Bruce Brooks told The Dispatch on Monday. Westergaard's niece called Pataskala police at 2:47 p.m. for a welfare check after no one could reach Westergaard. She was supposed to leave her home in the 4000 block of Mink Street, where she lived alone, at 10:30 a.m. to go to her niece's home in Norton, Ohio, just outside of Akron, according to the police's incident report. Westergaard was found on her property near the house, Brooks said. Brooks called the case a ""horrible, horrible situation,"" but could not share much information as the case is still under investigation, adding that the department will share more once Westergaard's full autopsy results are completed in four to six weeks. The two pigs were owned by a neighbor. Brooks said he was unsure what will happen to the pigs or whether their owner will be charged criminally. The department, he said, is in touch with the Licking County Prosecutors' Office over the case. As of now, the pigs owner has not been charged with a crime, Brooks said, and he did not release the owner's identity. Brooks said while Ohio law has a clear process for when dogs attack and kill someone, there aren't any laws about livestock that officers or prosecutors have found. ""If it was a pit bull or a Rottweiler, or name any of the other 15 dogs that are deemed semi aggressive, then we would know the answer right away,"" he said.

The drop in crime was led by a dip in murders, from 391 in 2023 to 377 last year, and 48 fewer people shot. “This translates to 3,362 fewer incidents of major crime last year compared to the year before — and these are not just numbers,” Tisch said. “We’re talking about thousands of people who are not injured abused, attacked or targeted by criminals.” There was also a 5% drop in major crime in the subway system and in housing projects, Tisch and Adams announced in a press conference at NYPD headquarters at One Police Plaza in Lower Manhattan. But Tisch noted that “we still must do more because people don’t feel safe in our subways.” The city has been rocked by a string of high-profile crimes in the subway recently, most notably the homeless woman fatally set afire in Coney Island last month. The additional cops, Tisch noted, will be assigned to ride the trains and patrol the platforms — the two places where 78% of subway crime occurs. When asked about the overtime controls put in place in the wake of a still-burgeoning administrative overtime scandal, Tisch noted the newly-deployed officers are being paid straight time to patrol the subways. Another move, already underway, Tisch said, is the assignment of 650 cops to newly-designated “zones,” crime hotspots across the city, with plans to create weekly internal reports detailing “specific segments of neighborhoods, blocks and even certain streets, where we see spikes in violence and disorder.” In the summer months that 650 will grow to 1,000. She noted the recent drop in retail theft on Fulton St. in Downtown Brooklyn that followed the creation of such a zone. Despite the crime drop, rapes, lead by a surge in attacks by victims’ domestic partners, were up 19% last year. Tisch also noted the “rightful” legal broadening of what constitutes rape in New York State to include more forms of nonconsensual sexual contact. Felony assaults also increased, by 5%, with spikes in stranger attacks, domestic violence and cops assaulted, Tisch said. The top cop and Adams also lamented again the problem with recidivism, noting sharp increases from 2018 in suspects arrested three or more times in one year for the same crime, typically after being released without bail. Those recidivism increases — 147% for those charged with felony assault, 119% for grand larceny auto, 83% for robbery, 71% for grand larceny, 64% for shoplifting and 61% for burglary— demoralize cops and traumatize victims, they said. Tisch noted the case of Gary “Green Eyes” Worhty, who was on lifetime parole when he was shot dead by police in November after shooting and wounding an NYPD cop and an innocent bystander in Queens. He had been arrested at least several times since his 2021 release from prison. “This is evidence of a broken system,” Tisch said, “one that doesn’t put the rights and needs of victims first.” Adams said he will continue to push for changes to controversial criminal justice reforms that took effect at the start of 2020. He stressed that while he is not criticizing bail reform, which we had advocated for as a cop and state legislator, there clearly needs to be a move toward keeping off the streets those repeatedly accused of the same crime. “Do you know that this does to Miss Jones on her way to school and she was robbed on Monday and she’s walking down the block and she sees the person that robbed her back out on the street, robbing her neighbor?” Adams asked. ” It destroys your feeling that your city is taking care of you.”",0,[],2025-01-06 22:58:15,2025-01-06 22:58:15
https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-says-ll-end-dei-211829048.html,"Trump says he’ll end DEI at federal level, as report shows $1 billion in spending since 2021",,Politics,Deseret News,4 min read,"Private companies are also moving away from DEI initiatives, while looking for ways to remain inclusive.",Eva Terry,2025-01-06T21:18:29.000Z,"During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump promised to eliminate federal spending on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, reversing course from President Joe Biden, who boosted DEI practices during his presidency. Trump said he wants to fire DEI government employees and will “direct the Department of Justice to pursue federal civil rights cases against schools that continue to engage in racial discrimination.” He also said he would hold universities accountable “that persist in explicit unlawful discrimination under the guise of equity” by fining them the “entire amount of their endowment.” Vice President-elect JD Vance sponsored the Dismantle DEI Act in the Senate last June “to eliminate all federal DEI programs and funding for federal agencies, contractors which receive federal funding, organizations which receive federal grants, and educational accreditation agencies.” According to Axios, two first-day issues for Trump will be to “revoke federal DEI requirements” and “terminate federal staffers implementing DEI policies.” There are still a wide range of views on whether private companies and the federal government should promote DEI. For example, Bill Townsend, CEO and founder of College Rover, told NBC, “The big positive about DEI is that it exposes people to ethnic groups and viewpoints about ethnicities that are different from how they were raised at home.” “We have to work and live among people who are different from us. DEI helps us manage that dynamic,” he continued. “Getting rid of DEI reinforces the fact that you don’t have to get along with everybody. It shouldn’t be that way.” On the other hand, The Heritage Foundation claims DEI programs “don’t make people more tolerant of individual differences.” Harvard public policy professor Iris Bohnet said that although about $8 billion is spent yearly in the U.S. on DEI trainings, “I did not find a single study that found that diversity training in fact leads to more diversity.” Bohnet added, “It is actually very hard to change mind-sets.” The grassroots organization, Parents Defending Education, released a report mid-December showing that since 2021, the federal government has spent over $1 billion in diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, grants. Broken down, roughly $490 million went to DEI hiring, $343 million went to DEI programming and $169 million went to DEI based mental health/social emotional learning, according to the report. In Utah, the Cook Center for Human Connection located in Pleasant Grove received $4 million to serve 25,000 sixth-eighth graders. Anne Brown, the president/CEO of Cook Center for Human Connection, explained the work the organization does: “If your child’s dealing with anger or resentment or depression or anxiety, there’s courses that are directly to parents on these topics. It’s directed to you as a parent, to get you the resources you need so that you can support your child.” In other states, schools have received grants funding antiracist social-emotional learning counseling for students, youth activism and race-based teacher affinity groups. As a nation, the attitude surrounding DEI initiatives appears to have tipped towards the negative since last February, according to Pew Research Center. Matching this nationwide trend are Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk, the leading figures behind the new Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which has a mandate to “slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies.” Musk has consistently voiced concern over the DEI movement on X, most recently writing, “DEI is racism and sexism.” He has said the movement is founded in illegal practices since it “discriminates on the basis of race, gender and many other factors.” Similarly, Ramaswamy, the soon to be head of the Department of Government Efficiency, wrote, “Biden’s Department of Health and Human Services has gone wild on DEI,” claiming there are 207 DEI employees across seven offices, and 294 taxpayer-funded DEI staffers. He continued, “The price tag for payroll alone exceeds $67 million, with a majority of these DEI hires making six-figure salaries. The latest HHS budget request mentions ‘equity’ 829 times, with requests seeking to address ‘racial equity and environmental justice’ at the forefront. An efficient government has no place for DEI bloat. Time to DOGE it.”",0,[],2025-01-06 22:58:15,2025-01-06 22:58:15

Throughout and after the winter weather event, residents were encouraged to stay home and off the roads unless necessary as conditions hadn't improved. Crews from both the City of Salina and Saline County were out plowing roads and streets before the snow stopped falling and continued through the day Monday. Despite this effort by the employees, much of the rest of the local government operated with limited functions, with the city and county announcing Sunday evening that offices would delay opening to the public, at 10 a.m. Monday. In addition to a late start, Saline County announced that the Senior Center and 28th Judicial District Court would be closed and Meals on Wheels wouldn't be delivering Monday. The City of Salina announced that the landfill would be closed and trash collections were also canceled Monday. Additionally, the city said circumstances for other operations might vary office-by-office. ""Citizens are encouraged to attempt to conduct their business remotely from home or call ahead to confirm the office and/or the staff person they wish to see will be available due to changing circumstances in response to the on-going weather conditions,"" the city said in a news release. Finally, a special meeting of the Salina City Commission that was scheduled for Monday evening was also canceled. The meeting was set to include discussion of appointing an interim city manager after the announcement of current City Manager Mike Schrage's resignation, effective in February. ""Details on when it will be rescheduled are forthcoming, depending on the projected clearing of roads within the next few days,"" the city said.

Rebecca Westergaard, 75, of Pataskala, died after being attacked by two pigs that were roaming near her Mink Street home, Pataskala Police Chief Bruce Brooks told The Dispatch on Monday. Westergaard's niece called Pataskala police at 2:47 p.m. for a welfare check after no one could reach Westergaard. She was supposed to leave her home in the 4000 block of Mink Street, where she lived alone, at 10:30 a.m. to go to her niece's home in Norton, Ohio, just outside of Akron, according to the police's incident report. Westergaard was found on her property near the house, Brooks said. Brooks called the case a ""horrible, horrible situation,"" but could not share much information as the case is still under investigation, adding that the department will share more once Westergaard's full autopsy results are completed in four to six weeks. The two pigs were owned by a neighbor. Brooks said he was unsure what will happen to the pigs or whether their owner will be charged criminally. The department, he said, is in touch with the Licking County Prosecutors' Office over the case. As of now, the pigs' owner has not been charged with a crime, Brooks said, and he did not release the owner's identity. Brooks said while Ohio law has a clear process for when dogs attack and kill someone, there aren't any laws about livestock that officers or prosecutors have found.

Police are searching for Virgil Thew, who has been charged with their deaths.","Karen Madden, USA TODAY NETWORK - Wisconsin",2025-01-06T21:11:08.000Z,"NEW LISBON − A 33-year-old woman and two girls, ages 12 and 13, were found shot to death Dec. 30 in a Juneau County apartment. An eight-day manhunt has been underway since Dec. 30 for Virgil G. Thew, 47, of New Lisbon, in connection with their deaths. On Friday, the New Lisbon Police Department announced a statewide crime alert had been issued and the search for Thew had expanded outside of the New Lisbon area. On Monday, the police department said multiple state and federal agencies were involved in the search for Thew, who has been charged with three counts of first-degree intentional homicide in connection with the deaths. Here is what we know about the case so far. At about 7:40 a.m. Dec. 30, the father of a 13-year-old girl notified the Monroe County Sheriff's Office the girl was missing. The father used SnapChat to find her location at an apartment Virgil Thew shared with his mother and girlfriend on West Bridge Street in New Lisbon, according to a criminal complaint filed Friday. While searching for the 13-year-old girl, police learned a 12-year-old girl also was missing. Police could not find the two girls, Thew or his girlfriend. At 4:23 p.m. Dec. 30, almost nine hours after the 13-year-old girl first was reported missing, a 911 caller reported finding three bodies in a bedroom at Thew's apartment, according to the complaint. The 33-year-old woman has been identified as Elizabeth Kolba, and the ages of the girls have been listed as 12 and 13, by the New Lisbon Police Department. The police department is withholding the girls' names. The criminal complaint identifies Kolba as Thew's girlfriend, and the 12-year-old girl as Thew's stepdaughter. The woman and two girls were found dead on a bed in Thew's bedroom at 4:23 p.m. Dec. 30. The door to the bedroom was secured with multiple locks. Family members said Thew got very angry when someone went into his bedroom, according to the criminal complaint. The girls and woman each died from an apparent gunshot wound, according to the complaint. Court documents state the three victims died sometime between Dec. 27 and Dec. 30. On Friday, Thew was charged with three counts of first-degree intentional homicide, one as a domestic abuse incident, and a warrant was issued for his arrest in Juneau County Circuit Court. According to the criminal complaint, Thew was seen with the girls around the time of their deaths and he is the stepfather of the younger girl. The criminal complaint also identifies the 33-year-old woman as Thew's girlfriend. Thew is 5 feet and 11 inches tall, weighs about 160 pounds and has a 1-inch scar on his forehead, according to the New Lisbon Police Department. He has brown hair and blue eyes. Police started looking for Thew on Dec. 30. The last confirmed sighting of Thew was near Orange and McEwen roads in the Juneau County town of Lisbon on Jan. 1. After an extensive search of the area by ground and drone, law enforcement has not located Thew. They believe that Thew may now be outside the New Lisbon area, they announced Friday night. The New Lisbon Police Department along with other agencies in Wisconsin, the FBI and the U.S. Marshals Services are searching for Thew, according to the New Lisbon Police Department. On Friday night, the New Lisbon Police Department announced a statewide crime alert had been issued for Thew. Thew is wanted through Wisconsin Probation and Parole. People should consider him armed and dangerous, according to the New Lisbon Police Department. If seen, do not approach Thew and contact 911. Contact Karen Madden at kmadden@gannett.com.

During winter, there tends to be a general belief that keeping your home warm costs more money, but a little work upfront can help you save money through the season. Tennessee spends, on average, between $5 million and $10 million in repairing damages from winter storms and freezes, compared to the United States average of $3.1 billion. With the 2022 North American winter storms, Tennessee spent $500 million to $1 billion in damages. Here's what to know about winterizing your home ahead of the season. A few companies have recommended a range of tips to keep your home safe during winter. Grange Insurance advises people to check gutters to prevent ice dams from occurring with snow melting and refreezing during the cold. They recommend removing garden hoses that are attached to the house, draining them and storing them for the season. Lowe's recommends adding weather stripping to your doors and windows to prevent cold air from leaking into your home. Bring in the outdoors via plants, grills and outdoor furniture. If you can't bring them inside or in a garage, get covers or blankets to shield them from frigid temperatures. The United States Department of Energy recommends these tips to save energy and money during fall and winter: Take advantage of heat from the Sun by opening south-facing windows during the day to let sunlight naturally heat the home. Make sure to close them again at night reduce chill from the windows. Use a heavy-duty, clear plastic sheet on a frame or tape clear plastic film to the inside of window frames during winter months to reduce draft from windows. Set the thermostat as low as comfortable when at home, and at night, set it down five degrees or more to save on your heating bills each winter month. Schedule routine service for home heating systems to make sure your system is working as efficiently as possible to reduce extra costs. Keep the fireplace damper closed unless a fire is burning to reduce heat loss through the chimney. Check and replace central heating filters regularly. This is done to avoid making your system work harder with dirty filters. It is recommended by State Farm to take time to make sure pipes don't freeze by following these steps: Insulate pipes Use heat tape or heat cables Seal leaks in the home via windows or cracks Secure outdoor faucets by draining and taking in hoses and sprinklers Let both hot and cold water drip indoors to keep water flowing Adjust the thermostat to stay warm overnight Open cabinet doors to let air hit indoor pipes Keep the garage door closed if exposed pipes are inside it Technically pipes can freeze in 32-degree weather, but most will not freeze until under 20 degrees. The longer the temperature remains under 20, the greater the chance of freezing. Pipes can fully freeze within six hours if the temperatures are cold enough. State Farm also recommends taking these steps if your pipes do end up freezing because of the near-zero temperatures: Shut off the water supply Open faucets Use a hair dryer or a space heater to warm pipes Turn up the heat in the house Do not use an open flame to warm pipes Do not pour hot water down the drain to warm pipes Call a plumber if needed This article originally appeared on Memphis Commercial Appeal: How to save money while heating your home this winter in the South",0,[],2025-01-06 22:59:26,2025-01-06 22:59:26

Taking place during Ramadan, it’s a time when devoted Muslims pray, study the Qur’an and ask for forgiveness from Allah. And, as with any religion, it has been weaponized by some extremists for their own agendas. My husband, an Apache pilot, had recently arrived in Afghanistan, and his unit was briefed that Islamic extremists would likely attack that night, wanting to claim an enormous reward from Allah. At sunrise, 150 insurgents dressed in stolen American uniforms surrounded two bases in Afghanistan. Unfortunately, my husband had just landed on one of those bases from his nighttime mission and was caught in the crosshairs. As the enemy began cutting through the wire, my husband and his co-pilot lifted off again to defend the base. That’s when 15 bullets pierced his aircraft, and a rocket-propelled grenade missed the nose of his aircraft by one foot. He and his co-pilot survived the attack and were unharmed physically, but there are deeper layers that become injured in ways we cannot see. What we weren’t prepared for as a new military couple was that the effects of a traumatic combat deployment often come home and seep into your marriage. The events on the Night of Power attempted to divide my husband and me as we struggled to process what was happening and how to bring healing. Before my husband went to war, I idolized him, but that began to change when he returned home. He’s an impressive human being with a long list of achievements, so putting him on a pedestal was easy. The thing is, military life is shakey, and you can get the pedestal knocked out from underneath you pretty quickly. When my husband came home from Afghanistan, the military quickly sent us to Ft. Novosel, home of Army Aviation. Why not move two weeks after a traumatic deployment? If you haven’t been there, Enterprise, Alabama, is a tiny southern town where everyone knows you and calls you sweetie. There’s nowhere to run in a town like that but the local church. So, that’s exactly what I did. Thankfully, that move helped save my marriage. As I navigated the difficulties of a new city, a lack of friends, a strained marriage and unemployment, something interesting was about to happen. God began to teach me the unhappiness I was experiencing was a good thing. But how can that be? I thought marriage was about happiness, and mostly mine! However, that belief misses the mark and contributes to our devastatingly high divorce rates. In fact, the military has the highest divorce rate of any profession, double that of civilians. And for those service members who develop PTSD, their divorce rates skyrocket to 60%. The military lifestyle is one of perpetual trials, so we won’t always be happy. So, how do we stay married if we find ourselves unhappy? In my 15 years as a military spouse, I’ve realized that since God created marriage, we must follow His model if we’re going to get it right. I tried to make my marriage work for over a decade using my ideas and trying to push my agenda. Not surprisingly, it didn’t work well. When I finally got sick of feeling constant resentment and bitterness toward my husband, the military, and all the sacrifices I’d endured at the hand of Uncle Sam, I decided to try marriage God’s way. It’s counterintuitive, but God tells us to love each other extravagantly and selflessly. He wants us to continuously put the other person first (even when we don’t feel like it). So, longing for joy to return to my marriage, I tried it. I created a 40-day challenge to love my husband. And wouldn’t you know, even though I was the one loving and serving him, we had the best 40 days of our marriage? It changed our hearts. So much so that my husband decided he didn’t want it to end, creating a 40-day challenge for me. Unfortunately, it took me 10 years to learn to love that way because I was so stuck in the challenges of military life. I was not equipped for multiple deployments, 12 moves, regular solo parenting, financial challenges, and combat trauma. If only someone would have handed me a military marriage manual and said, “Here’s how you do this well.” Thankfully, that exists now! As a writer, I recognized the need for an all-encompassing guide to prepare military spouses from brand new to seasoned. Born out of our military marriage challenges and a desire for others to feel equipped to live out military life, I wrote the book Mission-Ready Marriage: A Christian Guide to Discovering Hope and Purpose as a Military Wife. I believe this book contains exactly what our community needs to begin to feel prepared, seen, and even celebrated! Military spouses make up a mere .0128% of the world’s population. We are finely selected to live out this calling. God has assigned us an incredibly significant purpose in this role, and I can’t wait to tell you all about it!",0,[],2025-01-06 22:59:26,2025-01-06 22:59:26

Beginning Monday night, nighttime temperatures are expected to fall into the single digits through Friday, according to a forecast from the National Weather Service in Louisville. The daytime won't provide much relief, as temperatures are expected to stay well below freezing through Friday. A bitterly cold wind chill will also impact Louisville and much of Kentucky. During a news conference Monday, NWS Louisville Meteorologist-in-Charge John Gordon said the wind chill for the metro area Thursday may be between -5 and 5 degrees. ""Cold air temperatures will have significant impact on locations without power,"" the weather service stated in a Monday update. ""Exposed water pipes may need protection."" Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday utility crews from around the commonwealth are working to restore electricity to homes ahead of the anticipated drop in temperature. Thousands of customers remained without power Monday, but the number was down from a peak of more than 90,000 during the worst of the storm. “We’re working with local officials to get the word out to those who have lost power and have medical devices that need to run. We need those folks to be moving toward a warming center,” he said. “If you don’t have power by midday (Monday), you need to be looking at finding a warming center or location that has power.” In Louisville, a ""white flag operation"" is typically in place when temperatures are below 35 degrees. A number of Louisville-area organizations opened warming centers during Winter Storm Blair. Another round of snow could arrive as soon as Friday, but Gordon did not expect much to fall. ""Is it going to snow? I think so,"" Gordon said Monday. ""Is it going to snow a lot? No. Right now we have minor accumulations of less than 2 inches in the forecast."" The weather service's forecast for Louisville estimated a 20% chance of snow after 1 p.m. Friday and a 40% chance of snow Friday night. Monday night: Mostly cloudy, with a low around 9. North wind 5 to 8 mph becoming calm after midnight. Tuesday: Partly sunny, with a high near 30. Wind chill values as low as 10. Calm wind. Tuesday night: Mostly cloudy, with a low around 9.

But the Baltimore-based business closed its five locations for the day. Max’s Taphouse in Fells Point, which normally closes on winter Mondays, did the opposite, opening the bar for a snow day. They were among Baltimore-area businesses scrambling to adjust to the season’s first snowstorm, which the National Weather Service said dumped about 5.8 inches of snow at BWI Marshall Airport by 1 p.m. on Monday. Another 1 to 3 inches were expected in the evening in Baltimore and farther south. “We are open seven days a week, typically, and we are closed because of snow,” David Alima, co-owner with his wife of Baltimore-area Charmery shops in Hampden, Towson and Columbia, said Monday. “It really comes down to our employees and their safety. I’d love to be open and serving ice cream, but so many of our employees rely on public transportation and their own transportation.” Alima said he and his wife made the decision Monday morning, when he realized, “This is like a real snow. We haven’t had one of these in a while.” At Max’s in Fells Point, it has become a tradition over the past few decades to open up on “snow days,” if an employee can safely make it to work, said Gail Furman, co-owner of the family-owned tavern. “They safely got there, it was a walkable situation for them,” Furman said Monday. “With people working from home, with kids and noise, people can come in and work and use the Wi-Fi and enjoy themselves in peace, and still have a beer or cocktail if they’d like.” Max’s snow days have been popular over the years, she said, because many customers live in the neighborhood or nearby and within walking distance. Several came in Monday after a noon email blast inviting people to “Spend your snow day with Max’s Taphouse. We are open now ’til whenever you stop coming by for beer.” Business slowed down elsewhere around the region as schools, government agencies and courts closed for the day and officials asked people to avoid driving to allow crews to clear roads. Some workers came in during pre-dawn hours to stock Graul’s Market in Annapolis, but by mid-day, in one of the region’s harder-hit areas, the store opted for an earlier-than-usual 4 p.m. closing. One employee said only two cashiers and a manager made it to work and “we haven’t had many customers at all.” In Catonsville, some workers got to jobs at Panera Bread in the morning only to turn around and leave when it was announced that the eatery would close because of the storm. “Our top priority is the safety of our team members and guests,” a Panera spokesperson said in an email. The spokesperson declined to answer questions about how widespread closures were as the storm battered the Mid-Atlantic. A Giant Food spokesman said all stores remained open on Monday, “and we continue to serve our customers during the snowstorm.” At Waverly Ace Hardware in Baltimore’s Better Waverly neighborhood, business had slowed down a bit Monday from the weekend, when shovels, sleds and ice melt sold out or came close to it, said Nathan Shaw, a manager. Only one pallet of ice melt remained from the most recent delivery of eight, he said. Shaw said enough workers were able to get to work to open the store on time at 8 a.m. “We have a lot of people who walk,” he said. The snow, however, kept the warehouse from making an expected delivery and the store expected to close about four hours early. “If we had more shovels, we’d still be selling them,” Shaw said. “We’re always busy when it snows. It helps during a slow time of year.” Have a news tip? Contact Lorraine Mirabella at lmirabella@baltsun.com, (410) 332-6672 and @lmirabella on X.",0,[],2025-01-06 22:59:26,2025-01-06 22:59:26
https://www.yahoo.com/news/increased-social-security-benefits-know-210744048.html,Who will get increased Social Security benefits? What to know after Biden signs bill,,US,The Times-Reporter,3 min read,"Here's what to know about the recently signed Social Security Fairness Act, including who it will benefit.","Jonathan Limehouse and Bailey Schulz, USA TODAY",2025-01-06T21:07:44.000Z,"With President Joe Biden signing a bill over the weekend to improve Social Security benefits for millions of public sector workers, many Americans may be wondering if they qualify for what the White House is calling the first expansion of such assistance in 20 years. On Sunday, Biden signed the Social Security Fairness Act, which eliminates two decades-old provisions − the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) − that reduced Social Security benefits for a portion of retirees who received pension income. ""The bill I'm signing today is about a simple proposition: Americans who have worked hard all their lives to earn an honest living should be able to retire with economic security and dignity,"" Biden said on Sunday. Biden estimated the bill should lead to an average monthly increase of $360 for certain public employees and their spouses and survivors. The outgoing president said more than 2.5 million Americans will receive a lump sum payment worth ""thousands of dollars"" to compensate for the benefits they should have received last year. The bill, passed by the House of Representatives in November and approved in the Senate by a 70-26 vote last month, will cost $196 billion over the next 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. The move comes as Social Security recipients are receiving a 2.5% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2025. Here is what to know about the bill and who will be eligible for the boosted benefits. Turning 62 in 2025? Three critical things to know before applying for Social Security Police officers, firefighters, nurses, postal workers, public school teachers and government employees are among the nearly 3 million public sector workers affected by the provisions. Public sector employees include anyone who works for the government, a government-funded organization or a school, according to the U.S. Department of Labor and the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public & International Affairs. The bill is ""a great gift for our retired firefighters, police officers, postal workers, teachers, and others who for years contributed to Social Security, but are now being penalized because of their time of public service,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. said last month. ""That’s unfair. It’s deeply unfair. It goes against the American ideal of working hard, chipping in, and enjoying a well-earned retirement."" Before Biden signed the bill, the WEP reduced Social Security for those who earned “non-covered” pension income (which includes pensions from state and local governments, as well as non-U.S. employers) from their jobs, while the GPO reduced spousal or survivor benefits when an individual's pension is non-covered. Opponents of the bill, including Sen. Chuck Grassley, argue that it would unfairly benefit certain workers while increasing hardships for others on Social Security. ""Let’s be crystal clear: this bill would increase unfairness in how Social Security benefits are calculated,"" Grassley, R-Iowa, said in a speech on the Senate floor last month. The bill could also jeopardize the Social Security fund overall, critics say. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said the Social Security trust fund is less than 10 years away from being insolvent, and that the bill will speed this up. The Social Security Administration (SSA) said it is ""evaluating how to implement the Act"" and ""will provide more information as soon as available."" For those who have previously filed for Social Security benefits and they are partially or completely offset, the SAA says, ""You do not need to take any action except to verify that we have your current mailing address and direct deposit information if it has recently changed."" For those who have not previously filed for Social Security benefits and are interested in doing so, the SAA says they can file online or schedule an appointment.

Kent Police say Dwight Harris, Artavious Magee, and Jaiquane Wheeler shot and killed 48-year-old Amy Dyke while she was in the car with two other people. They tell us 58 rounds were fired at the car. Dyke was shot multiple times, including in the head, and she died the next day. Arrests were finally made in the case last week after a community tip led Kent Police to the three suspects. Prosecutors say this is not the first time each of these suspects have been accused of killing someone. Wheeler, Harris, and Magee were arrested and charged with first-degree murder. Both Wheeler and Magee are also facing separate current killing charges from 2023 as well. Charging documents show Wheeler shot and killed a man in July 2023. Magee is accused of shooting and killing a minor in April 2023. Harris was convicted of manslaughter in a 1994 case. A year and a half after Amy Dyke was shot and killed, her daughter Lyndsey Dyke tells us she misses her every day. “I didn’t think I was going to lose her for another 30-40 years,” Dyke said. She said she knows the court process will likely be very slow, but hopes justice is served. “It does bring us some peace that the three guys are in custody I’m just hoping that they won’t see daylight again,” Dyke said. Dyke says Amy was the best mom she could’ve asked for. “She always put others first and we’ve had a rough life, but she always figured out a way to make us happy,” Dyke said. Now, with a five-month-old baby, and a grandson her mother will never meet, Lyndsey said she tries to pass on the lessons she learned from her mom. “He was born just two days before the one-year anniversary of the incident he’s our little angel baby that she sent us,” Dyke said. These suspects are expected to be back in court in a few weeks. ",0,[],2025-01-06 22:59:26,2025-01-06 22:59:26

Judge Lewis J. Liman ruled Monday that Giuliani had failed to properly comply with evidence production requests over the last few months. Some of those assets include a valuable signed Joe DiMaggio jersey that appeared to disappear after Giuliani said he last saw it around Sept. 11 in his Manhattan apartment. Giuliani finished up his testimony Monday by appearing remotely from his Florida residence, where he explained why some assets and the paperwork related to them have been hard to locate and forfeit. Giuliani conceded during Monday’s testimony that he sometimes did not turn over everything requested because he believed the requests were overly broad or inappropriate or even a “trap” set by lawyers for the plaintiffs. RELATED STORIES: Giuliani fights to keep Florida condo, World Series rings despite judgments against him Rudy Giuliani ordered to appear at contempt hearing to give up assets to Fulton election workers Giuliani says he can’t find new lawyer to take case, blames judge Former GA election workers ask for ‘severe’ sanctions against Rudy Giuliani Rudy Giuliani scolded by judge after courtroom outburst accusing him of being unfair Former Fulton election workers say Rudy Giuliani continues to defame them, want more penalties He also said he sometimes had trouble turning over information regarding his assets because of numerous criminal and civil court cases requiring him to produce factual information. Giuliani, 80, said the demands to turn over materials made it “impossible to function in an official way” about 30% to 40% of the time. The election workers’ lawyers say Giuliani has displayed a “consistent pattern of willful defiance” of Liman’s October order to give up assets after he was found liable in 2023 for defaming their clients by falsely accusing them of tampering with ballots during the 2020 presidential election. They said in court papers that he has turned over a Mercedes-Benz and his New York apartment but not the paperwork necessary to monetize the assets. And they said he has failed to surrender watches and sports memorabilia, including a Joe DiMaggio jersey, and has not turned over “a single dollar from his nonexempt cash accounts.” Giuliani said Monday that he was investigating what happened to the DiMaggio jersey and that he currently doesn’t know where it is or who has it. Aaron Nathan, a lawyer for the election workers, asked the judge to make inferences about what Giuliani had not turned over — such as the list of his doctors over the last four years — that would make it more likely the court would conclude that the Palm Beach property was not Giuliani’s primary residence and thus is not protected from seizure. Joseph Cammarata, Giuliani’s attorney, said reaching such a conclusion would be like a civil “death penalty” and would cause Giuliani to lose the Florida property even before a trial in mid-January, when the judge is supposed to hear testimony and view evidence before deciding the disposition of the condominium and World Series rings. Giuliani has insisted that the Palm Beach property is his personal residence now and should be shielded from the judgment. His lawyers have predicted that he will eventually win custody of the items on appeal. The Associated Press contributed to this article.",10,[],2025-01-06 22:59:26,2025-01-06 22:59:26

Hands clasped before her, Harris looked ahead plainly and intently as four senators took turns reading off the electoral totals from each state. She broke into a wide smile both when the vote total reached a threshold to declare Trump the next president and when she received a standing ovation from her party when her vote total was read. Harris’ message of this Jan. 6 was one that both she and her predecessor on the campaign trail, President Joe Biden, conveyed time and again to voters. They advocated for “freedom” and democracy and shunned the events of the violent riot by Trump supporters on Jan. 6, 2021, that saw an unprecedented attack on the nation’s Capitol. Missing on this day compared to four years earlier were gallows and a noose constructed outside the Capitol grounds. Or chants in support of hanging the vice president for failing to reject the will of the people and the true outcome of the election. Instead, the event transpired in the way it was meant to unfold, pro forma, taking all but 30 minutes. Ultimately, the American electorate rejected Harris, ushering in Trump and his vows to blow up the status quo. Trump claimed 312 electoral votes to Harris' 226, won the popular vote and swept across battleground states, including toppling Democrats' so-called ""blue wall"" of states typically necessary for their party's victory. Unlike Trump’s refusal to accept the outcome of 2020, Harris conceded her loss and attempted to offer her supporters comforting words a day after the election. “The outcome of this election is not what we wanted, not what we fought for, not what we voted for, but hear me when I say ... the light of America’s promise will always burn bright,” Harris said.

Dean will become Ayotte’s director of citizen services, a statewide role announced by her transition team Monday afternoon. Dean is officially retiring from his longtime University of New Hampshire police force post this Friday, Jan. 10, according to the college. Dean has spent 35 of his nearly 40 years in law enforcement at the University of New Hampshire Police Department. Dean has been the department’s chief since 2011, and he also serves as the school’s associate vice president for public safety and risk management. He is also the immediate past president of the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators. “It’s hard to say no when the governor comes calling,” Dean said in a phone interview Monday afternoon. Dean began working for the university police force in 1985. Five years later, he left to become the chief of police in Ashland, New Hampshire, then returned to the school’s police department in 1995. Ayotte’s team offered Dean the position in mid-December, he said. He accepted despite his previous intention to end his career at the university, which he hadn’t planned on leaving for several years. Dean stated he had “no plans” to retire prior to Ayotte’s offer. Now, days away from leaving campus, he said he will miss the daily interactions with students in Durham. “The world is changing, but don’t lose hope,” he advised current students. “They’re the future. These students are the future. They’re going to do great things. I know they are because I work with them.” Dean’s hire was one of 11 staff hires announced by Ayotte on Monday. Neither Ayotte nor her team described the responsibilities of the job Dean is assuming. “Chief Dean’s experience and outstanding character will be a valuable asset to the Governor’s Office as Governor-elect Ayotte and the team work to deliver for all of New Hampshire,” said John Corbett, spokesperson for Ayotte, in a statement Monday afternoon “My goal is to support the governor,” Dean added. “That should always be the foundational thing (for) the constituents, everyone in the state, is that she knows what the issue is and we try to look at those issues.” Ayotte, a former Republican U.S. senator representing New Hampshire and the state’s attorney general from 2004 to 2009, is set to be inaugurated in Concord on Wednesday. Aaron Howell, executive vice president for finance and administration for the University of New Hampshire, shared news of Dean’s departure on Monday morning. A celebratory farewell for Dean will be held by the University of New Hampshire in Huddleston Hall in Durham on Friday morning. “Throughout his tenure, Chief Dean has earned a national reputation as an innovative and collaborative public safety leader,” Howell’s Monday message to the university community reads in part. “Under his guidance, the department consistently upheld the highest standards of service and community engagement. This commitment is evidenced by the department’s continued dual accreditation by the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies and the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators — a distinction achieved by only a select few agencies nationwide. He was also a key leader with USNH’s emergency management team in guiding (the University System of New Hampshire) through the turmoil brought about by COVID and helping our campus return to normalcy. Chief Dean has a well-established commitment to mental health training and collaboration throughout the law enforcement community and stakeholders, statewide.” Alongside Keene State University President Melinda Treadwell, Dean co-chaired the University System of New Hampshire’s COVID-19 response on college campuses across the state, collaborative efforts he looks back on with pride. Beginning in the 2020-21 academic year, months after campus had been shut down as the virus spread, students were required to test for the virus on a regular schedule, swabs were processed on-campus, and infected students were required to temporarily quarantine in campus housing. The pandemic not only took a toll on Dean professionally. Complications from the coronavirus claimed the life of his father, 90-year-old Douglas Dean, in May 2020. “UNH took the bold move to remain open,” Dean said Monday. “(Former university) President (James) Dean had tasked me with leading that in a lot of ways. We had such a great team put together. It really showed me all the amazing people at UNH, all the scientists that are just unbelievable at that. I learned so much from them. They adopted me. I’m really proud of us that we were able to stay open and we even developed a plan to have graduations. That was huge. That was one of the most important things.” Mental health support for students was another point of emphasis in Dean’s work, a charge he led with the memory of his brother who died by suicide. “I know that UNH’s efforts with mental health have definitely saved students here on campus,” he added. “My brother died by suicide. I don’t want any family going through that. It's been a passion of mine getting help for students. I think UNH does it better than anybody.” Steve Lee, deputy chief of the university police department, has been tapped as the school’s interim police chief following Dean’s exit, according to Howell. Lee is a 20-plus-year veteran of the University of New Hampshire Police Department and was named deputy chief in 2022. “He has built strong relationships within the UNH community and our surrounding jurisdictions,” Howell said of Lee. “I am confident in his ability to provide steady leadership during this transition.” A position description for the university police chief role will be created in the coming weeks, and a search is expected to kick off in the spring semester, Howell said.

(West Virginia International Yeager Airport | Courtesy photo) A winter storm blanketed West Virginia in snow and ice between Sunday evening and Monday, leaving thousands in the state without power as schools and businesses closed and road crews worked to keep streets as clear as possible. Jeremy Michael, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Charleston, said the “significant” storm — which was still ongoing Monday afternoon — brought “a wide range of impacts” across the state, from snow, freezing rain, ice and sleet. In Southern and Central West Virginia, Michael said regions saw roughly 3-7 inches of snow. In the northern regions of the state, however, snowfall was heavier, growing to about 7-11 inches early Monday afternoon. “Those totals could go up a little bit as it’s still snowing in places,” Michael said. “With the next round of snow and dropping temperatures, we expect conditions to get pretty icy, especially into [Monday] evening.” Along with the ice, Michael said there’s a chance of about 1-3 more inches of snow to fall across the state as the storm persisted on Monday evening. According to Appalachian Power, at its peak the storm knocked out power to 100,500 customers in its territory and left “treacherous road conditions, downed power lines and fallen trees.” Falling trees damaged at least two houses and brought down power lines Monday morning in the Elkview area of Kanawha County, according to reporting from WCHS-TV. As of around 3 p.m., more than 82,000 Appalachian Power customers — about 40,000 in West Virginia and 43,000 in Virginia — were still without electricity, according to the company’s outage map. The company expects to restore service to 90% of customers in both states by 6 p.m. Thursday, Jan. 9. “Customers can go to AppalachianPower.com and take a look at the outage map. They’ll be able to see what the estimated restoration time will be for their area,” Spokeswoman Debby Pannell said. “We will continue to restore customers throughout that period. So what we’re giving you really is when we anticipate having our last customers [in an area] restored.” Priority for restoration is given first to hospitals and nursing homes and then to large customer groups before single outages, she said. “We have about 5,000 workers just dedicated to this storm restoration,” Pannell said. “It is definitely all hands on deck — that includes internal support, field workers. We have assistance coming in, we actually started bringing them in [Sunday] before it even hit. But we have assistance coming in from our sister companies, AEP Ohio and Indiana Michigan [Power Company], along with contractors from Alabama, North Carolina and South Carolina.” She said people without power can help restoration efforts by turning off their high electric users such as heaters and water heaters until about 15 minutes after their power has been restored. “One thing that happens when the weather is so cold the way it is now, cold temperatures can cause line overload problems when we’re trying to restore to restore a large number of customers, and in a lot of cases, we have to restore outages and smaller groups letting the electric load settle before bringing on more customers,” she said. “That will help us distribute that load better,” she said. Pannell cautioned people not to go near downed power lines even if they appear not to be energized. “Sometimes people assume, because they’re on the ground they’re not live, and that’s not correct,” she said. “Please stay away from the power lines until we can get out there and make the repairs.” Gov. Jim Justice on Sunday evening declared a state of emergency in all 55 counties ahead of the storm. In a news release, he asked residents to be prepared for the impact the storm may bring. “Our top priority is safety, and we’re doing everything we can to stay ahead of the storm,” he said. “State agencies are on high alert, and we’ll continue to monitor the situation closely. I ask all West Virginians to stay alert, follow any instructions from emergency officials, and take necessary precautions. The next few days may bring challenges, so let’s all take care of each other.” A spokesperson for Justice did not respond to an email asking if the office was aware of any storm-related deaths. The governor’s emergency declaration allowed state transportation workers to better prepare for the winter storm, according to a release from the Department of Transportation. Through the declaration, the agency was able to pre-position personnel, vehicles and equipment to respond to impacts from the storm, including snow, ice, rain and wind. “We got a lot of pre-treating done in a lot of areas so that has helped us a bunch,” said Transportation Secretary Jimmy Wriston in the release. “Our crews have really done a great job all night. We’ve had incidents and had challenges; we always do, but that’s the human element out on the roadways.” Workers responsible for removing snow and controlling icy conditions conducted “dry runs” in November to prepare and train for inevitable storms, Wriston said. They went over different roads, looking for elements like ditches, culverts and more so they would know where they are when they’re covered in snow. “It’s necessary to have a good plan, it’s necessary to execute a good plan and talk to each other. SRIC (snow removal and ice control) is not a productivity activity, it’s a deliberate activity that has to be done slowly, methodically and safely,” Wriston said. Overall, Wriston urged drivers to remain cautious throughout Monday and to be patient with those working to make the roads passable as snow continues to fall and freezing temperatures remain. He urged those who did not have to travel to stay home whenever possible. “If you don’t have to go out in stuff like this, just don’t,” Wriston said. “Stay at home if you can, but if you have to go, go slow and give these drivers a lot of room. There’s no reason to go fast in this kind of stuff because going fast can cost you a lot of time.” The snowy and icy conditions left by the winter storm meant the suspension of several services and meetings throughout the state on Monday. United States Postal Service customers in the Central Plains and Mid-Atlantic regions — including West Virginia — were being advised Monday that the snow, freezing rain and icy conditions may affect mail processing, transportation and delivery and to allow extra time for final delivery of their mail and packages. According to the state Department of Education, no school districts in West Virginia were open for in-person classes on Monday because of the storm. Fifty of the state’s counties closed schools completely while five — Clay, Lincoln, Mason, Mingo and Pocahontas — held classes virtually. As of 4 p.m. Monday, at least 19 counties had canceled classes for Tuesday as well. For the most recent list of school closures or delays, visit https://wveis.k12.wv.us/closings/. Wednesday’s scheduled meeting for the state Board of Education was also cancelled, according to social media posts from the Department of Education. State legislative offices were closed Monday due to the weather and scheduled interim meetings for the state Legislature were also canceled that day. The meetings were meant to run from Monday to Tuesday and lead up to the opening of the 2025 legislative session on Wednesday. While several meetings scheduled for Tuesday have been canceled, as of 2 p.m. Monday no announcement had been made regarding the status for the second day of interims. In Charleston, Mayor Amy Shuler Goodwin postponed her State of the City Address, as well as a city council meeting. The address and meeting will now take place at 6 p.m. on Thursday, according to a news release. In travel news, several flights were cancelled or delayed Sunday into Monday morning at West Virginia International Yeager Airport in Charleston, according to Flight Aware, an online flight tracker. According to the site, there were seven cancelled flights and five delayed flights at Yeager on Sunday. Monday saw six flights cancelled and five others delayed as of 2:30 p.m., according to the website. Paige Withrow, the chief marketing officer for Yeager, said that the airport’s snow team was working “around the clock” from Sunday into Monday testing runway conditions and clearing snow as much as possible. They also worked to keep Airport Road — the main access point to the airport from Charleston — clear and safe. “Winter weather can present challenges for airports, and our crews are continuously monitoring conditions and responding as needed,” Withrow said in an email. “We encourage passengers with upcoming travel plans to check with their airline for the latest updates on their flights before heading to the airport, as schedules may be impacted by weather conditions at both departure and arrival destinations.” The Kanawha Valley Regional Transportation Authority also suspended bus service on Monday. Michael, with the National Weather Service, said while the worst of the storm system is set to pass through Monday evening, cold temperatures will likely persist throughout the remainder of the week. “We have a pretty prolonged period of below freezing temperatures ahead of us,” Michael said. “Here in Charleston and the Metro Valley, it’s not looking until potentially this weekend [that] we’re getting into the middle 30s. As you go further north, it may stay below freezing into the weekend and next week.” Pannell, with the power company, said that while the number of outages that have occurred during this storm was typical for an ice storm, the lingering cold temperatures expected for the rest of the week are not. “A lot of times you have a bounce back where it’ll get warm, the ice will melt off, that type of thing, but it looks like it’s going to stay very cold,” she said. “So that also makes for some challenges for us.” Michael said people will likely see single-digit or even subzero temperatures overnight in some areas. And windchill, he continued, will make the cold weather even more extreme. “The main point we’re looking at is really the deteriorating conditions into the evening,” Michael said. “With such prolonged cold, a lot of it comes to the aspect of safety. Frostbite can happen in minutes … check on vulnerable populations, especially with people out of power. Be careful.” The state Department of Health on Monday urged residents to take steps to be safe and warm while awaiting power restoration. “Safety and preparedness are critical when facing extreme winter conditions,” Cabinet Secretary Sherri Young said in a news release. “We urge everyone to take these precautions seriously and help look out for those in our community who may need assistance during this difficult time.” Residents without electricity should stay in one or two rooms of their house and close off unneeded areas to conserve heat, the department said. Use blankets and layered clothing to stay warm. Closing doors and windows, even if storm windows or plastic are already in place, will help prevent drafts. Putting towels or blankets under doors and around windows can help minimize heat loss. Be careful to have proper ventilation while using a fireplace or woodstove. Gas stoves, charcoal grills and portable heaters should not be used inside because they can cause dangerous carbon monoxide poisoning. Generators should not be run indoors or in adjacent garages as they can also cause carbon monoxide poisoning. Anyone with symptoms of frostbite, including numbness, tingling or pale skin in exposed areas, or hypothermia, including confusion, slurred speech and extreme shivering, should seek medical attention. The department also asked people to look after elderly or sick neighbors, particularly those who live alone, as they may be more vulnerable during outages. “For those who are able, offer assistance with food, heat, or transportation to a warming center. Ensure they have blankets, warm clothing, and access to emergency supplies,” the department said. Residents who need information about warming centers in their counties can call the non-emergency dispatch in their area. Contact information for those is available online here.

What else we learned in court.","Amelia Stern, The Enterprise",2025-01-06T21:00:13.000Z,"BROCKTON — Shocking new details were revealed Monday in the case of a Boston teenager prosecutors allege fatally stabbed a 19-year-old home from college in Brockton over the weekend. Jayden Fernandez, 18, of Dorchester, was arraigned in Brockton District Court Monday on first degree-murder charges after prosecutors said he fatally stabbed 19-year-old Kyre Ambrose at a Brockton residence shortly before 2 a.m. on Saturday, Jan. 4. Judge Jeffrey Clifford ordered Fernandez be held without bail after prosecutors said he allegedly stabbed Ambrose 28 times. Here’s what was revealed in court. Prosecutors said Brockton Police responded to a 911 call shortly before 2 a.m. Saturday where they found the victim, 19-year-old Kyre Ambrose, suffering from apparent stab wounds inside his family's home on Foster Street. Ambrose was transported to a hospital where he succumbed to his injuries, according to police. A preliminary examination by the medical examiner found Ambrose suffered 28 stab wounds to his person, prosecutors said. What happened on night of stabbing 18-year-old charged in fatal stabbing of 19-year-old in Brockton Ambrose’s mother, who was asleep in the residence at the time of the stabbing, told police she was awoken to sounds of her son yelling for help downstairs. She told police she witnessed a male wearing dark clothing on top of her son who appeared to be punching him, prosecutors said. The suspect allegedly fled the scene when Ambrose’s mother came downstairs, according to prosecutors. Prosecutors said police located surveillance footage near the complex that showed the male suspect, later identified as Fernandez, entering the Foster Street residence. In the surveillance footage, the victim appears to have opened the door for Fernandez, prosecutors said. Fernandez stayed inside the residence for 10 to 12 minutes, after which he can be seen on the surveillance footage fleeing out of the rear door of the residence, according to prosecutors. Prosecutors said Fernandez is alleged to have driven away from the scene in a grey sedan, where he stopped at a Brockton gas station before making his way home to Dorchester. The next day, police at Newton Wellesley Hospital alerted officials they treated a patient with a hand wound who indicated he had been in a fight with another individual at a party in Brockton, according to prosecutors. Police located and arrested Fernandez, who they said was sleeping in the hospital parking lot in a vehicle they believed he fled the scene of the stabbing in. The car was seized by police, who found red/brown stains inside, according to prosecutors. Police served a search warrant at Fernandez’s Dorchester residence where they found dark clothing, dark gloves and a knife that also had red/brown stains. They also located shoes with red/brown stains that investigators said matched footprints located at the scene of the stabbing, according to prosecutors. Fernandez’s phone was also found at the crime scene and was seized by police, prosecutors said. After presenting the evidence, prosecutors asked that Fernandez be held without bail on first-degree murder charges. How violent is Brockton? We compared it to 8 other cities to get the real answer. Fernandez’ defense attorney, Paul Lonardo-Roy, asked the judge to release his client on $5,000 bail, citing Fernandez’s age and the fact that he has no prior offenses. According to Lonardo-Roy, Fernandez had just graduated from a Boston charter school, holds two jobs and had plans to attend community college in the spring. “There’s more to the story than meets the eye,” Lonardo-Roy said. “The investigation is not concluded.” This article originally appeared on The Enterprise: New details emerge in court in Brockton homicide involving 2 teens",0,[],2025-01-06 23:00:43,2025-01-06 23:00:43

""And just because a cop was offended because of some language doesn't give him the power to arrest you.""",Emma Camp,2025-01-06T21:00:02.000Z,"A Kentucky man is suing the police, claiming he was arrested in retaliation for shouting at a group of officers from an apartment balcony. In a complaint filed last month, Brandon Rettig alleges that he was arrested on bogus public intoxication charges after he angered the officers, who violated his First and Fourth Amendment rights. According to the lawsuit, on June 8, 2024, Brandon Rettig was at his girlfriend's apartment in Newport, Kentucky, when a team of police officers responded to an unrelated incident outside the building. From the balcony, Rettig shouted at the officers. In a later interview, Rettig claimed to have shouted ""go get 'em boys"" at the officers. The lawsuit insists that while the officers were angered by the comments, ""Rettig did not utter fighting words or threatened to harm anyone."" The suit claims that soon after Rettig made the comments, Officer Ronald Lalumandier shouted up to him, ""Keep it up, I'll take your ass to jail,"" adding ""I got keys to your apartment."" Three police officers, including Lalumandier, then entered the apartment building using a key card, which Lalumandier had access to as a former tenant. According to body camera footage, the three officers confronted Rettig in the hallway of the apartment building and arrested him after a short argument. ""Are you serious? I live here,"" Rettig told the officers. ""Yes, 100 percent. We told you out there, you didn't listen,"" responded one of the officers. ""You shouldn't be doing what you're doing…doesn't mean you can act the way you were acting."" Rettig was taken into police custody and charged with public intoxication, despite the fact that—as the suit notes—the hallway was not public property. Although the charges were later dismissed, Rettig filed a lawsuit against the officers in December, arguing that his arrest was not due to public intoxication, but because he angered the officers by shouting at them. ""Rettig allegedly made critical statements to the Officer Defendants that those officers did not appreciate. This critical speech is protected by the First Amendment,"" the complaint states. ""In response, Defendants retaliated against Rettig, seized him, and arrested him in retaliation for protected speech."" ""Speaking from a balcony isn't a crime. Drinking a beer in your living room isn't a crime,"" Robert Thompson, Rettig's attorney, told WCPO 9 News, a Cincinnati, Ohio-based local news station.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom) While North Carolina Democrats mourned the anniversary of the storming of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Republicans refrained from commenting on the riots, instead congratulating President-elect Donald Trump on the confirmation of his victory. The electoral count proceeded without incident or objection Monday, a far cry from the large-scale protests that marked the date four years ago and were followed by a violent incursion into the Capitol Building that sent lawmakers fleeing for their safety. But North Carolina’s Democratic lawmakers sought to ensure that the attacks four years ago did not go forgotten — particularly as the man who spread the lie that the 2020 presidential election was stolen returns to office promising to pardon those who stormed the Capitol in his name. “Four years ago today, a violent mob — incited by then President Trump — attacked the U.S. Capitol and attempted to prevent the peaceful transfer of power,” said Rep. Deborah Ross (D-N.C.). “Today is a painful reminder of just how fragile our democracy is and how close we came to losing it.” “Now more than ever, we must remain committed to defending our democracy and ensuring this never happens again,” Rep. Valerie Foushee (D-N.C.) wrote in a post on X. Ross praised the work of the bipartisan January 6th Committee and condemned those “seeking to rewrite history.” Trump, notably, has repeatedly called the insurrection “a day of love.” President Joe Biden awarded former Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) and former Rep. Liz Cheney — the former chairs of the Jan. 6 committee — with the Presidential Citizens Medal last week in honor of their work. In a statement on behalf of the Democratic National Committee, chair Jaime Harrison called on all members of higher office to “make clear this kind of violent attack on our democracy can never happen again.” “Democrats remain steadfast in our support of the democratic values our country was founded on and will always work to ensure that our democratic processes and institutions continue to function in service of the American people, whether we win or lose,” Harrison wrote. No North Carolina Republicans in Congress acknowledged the anniversary of the insurrection, which saw five killed and 140 police officers injured, preferring instead to cheer the certification of the incoming president’s election. “Congress just CERTIFIED Donald J. Trump as the 47th President!” wrote Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.) on X. “Welcome back, Mr. President!” Hudson, now the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, was one of the 147 Republicans in the House of Representatives who objected to the certification of the 2020 election, citing repeatedly debunked claims of election fraud. All other current Republican representatives from North Carolina either objected to the certification or were not yet in Congress. “Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays the Congress from the swift completion of certifying the election of Donald J. Trump as our nation’s 47th president,” posted Rep. Chuck Edwards (R-N.C.), who joined Congress in 2023, alongside a selfie in front of a snowbound Capitol. This year’s election certification, at just 30 minutes, was the swiftest since 2013, according to C-SPAN. The certification of the 2020 election, put on hold as rioters were cleared from the Capitol Building by police, took nearly 15 hours. “CONGRESS CERTIFIES OUR GREAT ELECTION VICTORY TODAY,” Trump posted on Truth Social Monday afternoon, just before posting a photo of the Capitol awash in Trump supporters four years ago. “A BIG MOMENT IN HISTORY.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/cases-against-trump-guide-210000620.html,The Cases Against Trump: A Guide,,Politics,The Atlantic,10 min read,"Thirty-four felony convictions. Charges of fraud, election subversion, and obstruction. One place to keep track of the president-elect’s legal troubles.",David A. Graham,2025-01-06T21:00:00.000Z,"The first former president to be convicted of a felony is now also the first convicted felon to be elected as president. Donald Trump won reelection on November 5, paving the way for his return to the White House—as well as the end or postponement of the criminal cases against him. The extent to which those cases also paved the way for his return to the White House will be a topic of debate for years. One plausible argument is that the sense that Trump was being persecuted strengthened his support; another is that the failure to bring cases sooner and finish them deprived voters of complete information. Both may be true. A judge indicated on January 3 that he would sentence Trump on January 10 for his conviction on charges related to paying hush money to Stormy Daniels, but would grant the president-elect an “unconditional discharge,” which avoids probation or jail time and does not require Trump to meet any further qualifications, such as steady employment or not reoffending. This rejects Trump’s attempt to have the case thrown out and means he remains a felon, but otherwise closes out the matter. This was the only live criminal matter facing Trump. Federal cases against Trump related to attempting to subvert the 2020 election and hoarding classified documents at Mar-a-Lago were both dismissed at the Justice Department’s request in late 2024. The documents case, long considered the most straightforward, was bottled up by a Trump-appointed judge on dubious procedural grounds. The election-subversion case took a detour to the Supreme Court, where a conservative majority ran down the clock before ruling that a president has very broad immunity for most acts done as president. An election-subversion case in Fulton County, Georgia, is in indefinite limbo after a panel of state judges on December 19 removed District Attorney Fani Willis from the case, citing an “appearance of impropriety” in her relationship with a special prosecutor on the case. What follows is a summary of the major legal cases against Trump, assessments of the gravity of the charges, and a prognosis for each. This guide will be updated as necessary. In the fall of 2022, New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a civil suit against Trump, his adult sons, and his former aide Allen Weisselberg, alleging a years-long scheme in which Trump fraudulently reported the value of properties in order to either lower his tax bill or improve the terms of his loans, all with an eye toward inflating his net worth. When? Justice Arthur Engoron ruled on February 16 that Trump must pay $355 million plus interest, the calculated size of his ill-gotten gains from fraud. The judge had previously ruled against Trump and his co-defendants in late September 2023, concluding that many of the defendants’ claims were “clearly” fraudulent—so clearly that he didn’t need a trial to hear them. How grave was the allegation?  Fraud is fraud, and in this case, the sum of the fraud stretched into the hundreds of millions—but compared with some of the other legal matters in which Trump is embroiled, this is a little pedestrian. The case was also civil rather than criminal. But although the stakes are lower for the nation, they remain high for Trump: The size of the penalty appears to be larger than Trump can easily pay, and he also faces a three-year ban on operating his company. What happens now? On March 25, the day he was supposed to post bond, an appeals court reduced the amount he must post from more than $464 million to $175 million. Trump has appealed the case. In a September hearing, New York appeals-court judges seemed skeptical of the case against Trump and sympathetic to his arguments. They have not yet ruled. Although these other cases are all brought by government entities, Trump also faced a pair of defamation suits from the writer E. Jean Carroll, who said that Trump sexually assaulted her in a department-store dressing room in the 1990s. When he denied it, she sued him for defamation and later added a battery claim. When?  In May 2023, a jury concluded that Trump had sexually assaulted and defamed Carroll, and awarded her $5 million. A second defamation case produced an $83.3 million judgment in January 2024. How grave was the allegation?  Although these cases didn’t directly connect to the same fundamental issues of rule of law and democratic governance that some of the criminal cases do, they were a serious matter, and a federal judge’s blunt statement that Trump raped Carroll has gone underappreciated. What happens now?  Trump appealed both cases and posted bond for the $83.3 million in March. His appeal in the $5 million case was rejected on December 30. In March 2023, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg became the first prosecutor to bring felony charges against Trump, alleging that the former president had falsified business records as part of a scheme to pay hush money to women who said they’d had sexual relationships with Trump. When? The trial began on April 15 and ended with a May 30 conviction. Trump will be sentenced on January 10. How grave was the allegation? Many people have analogized this case to Al Capone’s conviction on tax evasion: It’s not that he didn’t deserve it, but it wasn’t really why he was an infamous villain. Trump did deserve it, and he’s now a convicted felon. Moreover, although the charges were about falsifying records, those records were falsified to keep information from the public as it voted in the 2016 election. It was among the first of Trump’s many attacks on fair elections. (His two impeachments were also for efforts to undermine the electoral process.) If at times this case felt more minor compared with the election-subversion or classified-documents cases, it’s because those other cases set a grossly high standard. What happens now? On January 3, Justice Juan Merchan scheduled sentencing for January 10, but indicated that he would likely sentence Trump to an unconditional discharge, which means no jail or probation time, and no other requirements to meet. Special Counsel Jack Smith charged Trump with 37 felonies in connection with his removal of documents from the White House when he left office, but Judge Aileen Cannon has dismissed the case, finding that Smith’s appointment was not constitutional. Smith appealed. The charges included willful retention of national-security information, obstruction of justice, withholding of documents, and false statements. Trump took boxes of documents to properties, where they were stored haphazardly, but the indictment centered on his refusal to give them back to the government despite repeated requests. [David A. Graham: This indictment is different] When?  Smith filed charges in June 2023. On July 15, 2024, Cannon dismissed the charges. Smith appealed that on August 26, but filed to dismiss charges on November 25. How grave was the allegation?  These are, I have written, the stupidest crimes imaginable, but they are nevertheless very serious. Protecting the nation’s secrets is one of the greatest responsibilities of any public official with classified clearance, and not only did Trump put these documents at risk, but he also (allegedly) refused to comply with a subpoena, tried to hide the documents, and lied to the government through his attorneys. How plausible was a guilty verdict? This once looked to be the most open-and-shut case: The facts and legal theory here are pretty straightforward. But Smith drew a short straw when he was randomly assigned Cannon, a Trump appointee who repeatedly ruled favorably for Trump and bogged the case down in endless pretrial arguments. Even before her dismissal of the case, some legal commentators accused her of “sabotaging” it. In Fulton County, Georgia, which includes most of Atlanta, District Attorney Fani Willis brought a huge racketeering case against Trump and 18 others, alleging a conspiracy that spread across weeks and states with the aim of stealing the 2020 election. When?  Willis obtained the indictment in August 2023. The number of people charged makes the case unwieldy and difficult to track. Several of them, including Kenneth Chesebro, Sidney Powell, and Jenna Ellis, struck plea deals in the fall. On December 19, an appeals court removed Willis from the case, citing her relationship with a former special prosecutor on the case. She has appealed, and the case’s future is murky. How grave is the allegation?  More than any other case, this one attempts to reckon with the full breadth of the assault on democracy following the 2020 election. How plausible is a guilty verdict?  This is a huge case for a local prosecutor, even in a county as large as Fulton, to bring. The racketeering law allowed Willis to sweep in a great deal of material, and she has some strong evidence—such as a call in which Trump asked Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find” some 11,000 votes. It’s now unclear whether the case will continue with Willis removed. Special Counsel Smith also charged Trump with four federal felonies in connection with his attempt to remain in power after losing the 2020 election. When?  A grand jury indicted Trump on August 1, 2023. The trial was originally scheduled for March but was frozen while the Supreme Court mulled whether the former president should be immune from prosecution. On July 1, 2024, the justices ruled that a president is immune from prosecution for official but not unofficial acts, finding that some of Trump’s postelection actions were official and sending the case back to the trial court to determine others. Smith obtained a new indictment on August 27, which retains the same four felony charges but omits references to corrupting the Justice Department. On November 25, Smith filed to drop charges because of Trump’s reelection. [David A. Graham: Trump attempted a brazen, dead-serious attack on American democracy] How grave was the allegation?  This case rivaled the Fulton County one in importance. It is narrower, focusing just on Trump and a few key elements of the paperwork coup, but the symbolic weight of the U.S. Justice Department prosecuting an attempt to subvert the American election system is heavy. How plausible was a guilty verdict?  The question is now purely speculative and academic. Once upon a time, cases were filed in more than 30 states over whether Trump could even appear on the 2024 ballot under a novel legal theory about the Fourteenth Amendment. Proponents, including J. Michael Luttig and Laurence H. Tribe in The Atlantic, argued that the former president was ineligible to serve again under a clause that disqualifies anyone who took an oath defending the Constitution and then subsequently participated in a rebellion or an insurrection. They said that Trump’s attempt to steal the 2020 election and his incitement of the January 6 riot meet the criteria. The Supreme Court conclusively disagreed. The justices ruled unanimously on March 4 that states could not remove Trump from the ballot, and appear on the ballot he did. Trump is set to be sworn in as the 47th president on January 20, 2025.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-seeks-delay-hush-money-205619333.html,Trump seeks delay in ‘hush-money’ sentencing,,Politics,Deseret News,3 min read,Trump's attorneys argue sentencing should await the outcome of ongoing appeals.,Emma Pitts,2025-01-06T20:56:19.000Z,"On the same day Congress certified Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 presidential election, the former president appealed the upcoming sentencing date made by the judge in his New York criminal case. Trump’s attorneys have argued that sentencing should be paused until his appeals are reviewed. On Friday, Justice Juan Merchan denied Trump’s motion to dismiss the conviction entirely and set a sentencing date of Jan. 10. Initially scheduled for July, the sentencing has been rescheduled multiple times due to conflicts with the election. It will now occur just 10 days before Trump begins his second presidential term. “As the parties are aware, it was on Defendant’s application, without opposition from the People, that sentence was adjourned until after the Presidential election. Any claim Defendant may have that circumstances have changed as a result of Defendant’s victory in the Presidential election, while convenient, is disingenuous,” Merchan’s Friday filing said. “Thus, it was fair for this Court to trust that his request to adjourn sentencing until after the election carried with it the implied consent that he would face sentence during the window between the election and the taking of the oath of office. The Supreme Court’s decision in Trump has delayed sentence — not precluded it.” Todd Blanche, Trump’s lead attorney in the criminal case in which a New York jury found him guilty on all 34 criminal counts, responded Monday morning with a last-minute request to stay the sentencing. One reason is that it would distract from the inauguration and his presidential duties. “The Court should vacate the sentencing hearing scheduled for January 10, 2025, and suspend all further deadlines in the case until President Trump’s immunity appeals are fully and finally resolved, which should result in a dismissal of this case, which should have never been brought in the first place,” Trump’s lawyers said in their court filing. “This Court’s decision to schedule a sentencing hearing on January l0, 2025, at the apex of Presidential transition and ten days before President Trump assumes Office, necessitates that President Trump will be forced to continue to defend his criminal case while he is in Office.” If the sentencing date proceeds, Trump will become the first U.S. president who is a convicted felon. However, given Trump’s presidential victory against Vice President Kamala Harris, Merchan has said he will not sentence him to prison but will instead grant an “unconditional discharge,” meaning no punishment will be enforced. “Today, President Trump’s legal team moved to stop the unlawful sentencing in the Manhattan D.A.’s witch hunt. The Supreme Court’s historic decision on Immunity, the state constitution of New York, and other established legal precedent mandate that this meritless hoax be immediately dismissed,” incoming White House communications director Steven Cheung told Fox News. “The American people elected President Trump with an overwhelming mandate that demands an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and all of the remaining witch hunts. We look forward to uniting our country in the new administration as President Trump makes America great again,” he added. Merchan has said in a previous filing that the argument of presidential immunity does not hold up in the “hush money” case. The case stems from payments labeled as business expenses made ahead of his presidential win in 2016 to keep adult film actress Stormy Daniels quiet about a sexual encounter she claims to have had with Trump back in 2004. If Merchan does not respond with a stay in the sentencing, Trump attorneys said in their filings they would “seek an emergency appellate review.”",0,[],2025-01-06 23:01:25,2025-01-06 23:01:25

https://www.yahoo.com/news/congress-certifies-2024-presidential-election-205355150.html,"Congress certifies 2024 presidential election, affirms Trump victory",,Politics,Deseret News,4 min read,Donald Trump calls the ceremony 'a big moment in history.',Samuel Benson,2025-01-06T20:53:55.000Z,"WASHINGTON — In a brief and seamless ceremony Monday afternoon, the U.S. Congress affirmed President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance winners of the 2024 presidential election. Four years after pro-Trump rioters stormed the Capitol and delayed the certification of the election for over 14 hours, Monday’s ceremony lasted just 30 minutes, interrupted only by cheers and applause from the members themselves, in support of their candidates. This year, the scene was calm outside the Capitol. The complex was surrounded by fencing and a large police presence, and the streets were largely empty, blanketed by five inches of snow from a massive storm the previous night. Vice President Kamala Harris presided over the joint session in her role as president of the Senate, marking just the third time in U.S. history a losing presidential candidate presided over Congress as it certified the election for their opponent. In a post on social media, Trump cheered Congress’ action. “CONGRESS CERTIFIES OUR GREAT ELECTION VICTORY TODAY — A BIG MOMENT IN HISTORY,” Trump wrote. “MAGA!” Trump won November’s vote by a narrow margin — 49.9% of the popular vote, to Harris’ 48.4% — but his sweep of all seven battleground states delivered him a landslide electoral victory. He secured 312 Electoral College votes, and Harris won 226. During Monday’s ceremony, members frequently stood to applaud when their state’s votes were announced, and the applause was loudest for the decisive battleground states, like Pennsylvania’s 19 votes and Wisconsin’s 10 votes. There were no objections to any state’s electoral votes. In 2022, Congress passed the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022, in an attempt to prevent delayed certification, as occurred in 2021. The bill raised the threshold for members of Congress to object to electoral votes: any objection must be supported by one-fifth of the Senate and one-fifth of the House, instead of by a single member. Further, the law clarified that the vice president’s position is “solely ministerial,” and has no power to overturn the votes. In 2021, Trump pressured then-Vice President Mike Pence to unlawfully interfere with the election results, which Pence declined to do. At the conclusion of Monday’s ceremony, when the total of 312 Electoral College votes were declared for Trump and Vance, the Republican side of the chamber erupted into applause and cheers. As each states’ votes were called, Rep. Burgess Owens shot a group text to the rest of the Utah delegation saying he would stand and applaud when the state’s votes were announced. On cue, the four U.S. House members from Utah — scattered across the Republican side of the chamber — stood and applauded when the six Utah votes were confirmed. Rep. Celeste Maloy, R-Utah, said Monday’s ceremony was “painless and drama free.” “I think a lot of people were hoping for more excitement, but it just went along like clockwork,” Maloy said, shortly after exiting the chamber. She represents Utah’s 3rd District. Rep. Burgess Owens in a statement to the Deseret News thanked Trump for giving Congress “a once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver on the America First agenda.” “From securing our borders and rebuilding our economy to restoring law and order and unlocking the American Dream for every child in every zip code, House Republicans are ready to fight, ready to lead, and ready to win,” said Owens, a Republican who represents Utah’s 4th District. The newest member of Utah’s delegation, Rep. Mike Kennedy, R-Utah, said in a statement to the Deseret News, “It was an honor to have the opportunity to vote to certify the 2024 election results.” Kennedy, who represents Utah’s 3rd District, said he looked forward to working with the Trump administration. He is filling the seat left vacant by Rep. John Curtis, who now represents Utah in the Senate.",0,[],2025-01-06 23:01:25,2025-01-06 23:01:25

Stuart police about 5:23 p.m. on Jan. 1 went to Smith-Turner Park in the 500 block of Southeast Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard for a report of a person who’d been stabbed, Stuart police have said. Officers found Marvin Fitzgerald Hall covered in blood in the grass about 8 feet from some picnic tables, a report states. Police reported seeing a stab wound to the left side of his chest and another stab wound to the left side of his body. He died after being taken to HCA Florida Lawnwood Hospital in Fort Pierce. Lt. Brian Bossio, police spokesperson, on Monday said a “person of interest” is in custody in Martin County on unrelated charges. That person was arrested the evening of the stabbing, Bossio said. “Detectives continue working this case and we anticipate a conclusion over the next few days,” Bossio said late Monday afternoon. At the park the day after the deadly incident, Andrew Brown, 45, of Stuart, said he was there during the encounter. Brown said he was sleeping at a picnic table, as the man who died slept at a second picnic table just feet away. “All I heard was … ‘Get off me,’” Brown said. “When I turned over, dude was stabbing him with a knife.” Brown noted what he said were blood stains on the concrete that he said came from the deceased. He said the attacker used a butcher knife. Brown said he had not previously seen the reported assailant, but knew the man who died in passing, saying he was a “good guy.” “He was just tired from New Year’s, said he was up for like two or three days,” Brown said.

Graves then drove away and parked at a neighboring business. The victim gave responding officers a description and a photograph of the truck.

The former New York City mayor and Donald Trump ally was sued for defamation by two Georgia election workers who he claimed tampered with ballots during the 2020 presidential election. Giuliani, who was once known as “America’s Mayor,” was ordered in October to give up his New York penthouse, a Mercedes-Benz and sports memorabilia along with money to satisfy the suit. Giuliani turned over his penthouse and car, but not the paperwork needed to monetize it, court papers said. He has also failed to surrender watches, claims to not know where a valuable Joe DiMaggio jersey is and has not paid out “a single dollar” to the election workers. The election workers' lawyers said that Giuliani has displayed a “consistent pattern of willful defiance” since the judge’s order. Giuliani admitted during a testimony in court on Monday that he did not want to turn over his assets because he found the requests overly broad, inappropriate and even a “trap” set by lawyers. He added that the requests to turn over assets and information made it “impossible to function in an official way” 30 to 40 percent of the time. A lawyer for the election workers is also pushing for the judge to rule that Giuliani’s Palm Beach home is not his primary residence, and is therefore able to be seized. Giuliani’s lawyer said that such a ruling would be a civil “death penalty” because it would allow Giuliani to lose the house before the trial in mid-January about the house and sports memorabilia. It’s not yet clear what punishment Giuliani will receive in the Georgia case.",2,[],2025-01-06 23:03:02,2025-01-06 23:03:02

The bombastic conservative podcaster took personal shots at the newly re-elected House Speaker Mike Johnson on his show Monday and asserted he now views “scam” H1-B visas as another form of illegal immigration. Those topics dominated right-wing circles early last week, but Bannon made clear he’s not ready for the so-called MAGA civil war to subside just yet. Bannon referred to Elon Musk as “the South African” on his show as he dissed H1-B visas, which allow foreign workers to be employed in specialty occupations stateside. Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who have been hired to lead Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency program, have fiercely defended H1-B visas. Musk has gone as far as suggesting that those who disagree are “retarded,” while Ramaswamy infamously bashed U.S. culture in a bizarre post about the visas that admonished jocks, prom queens, U.S. sitcoms, and even Saturday morning cartoons. MAGA critics of the visa program, like Bannon and the far-right influencer Laura Loomer, have countered that they take away job opportunities from Americans and are abused by employers looking to pay less for skilled labor. “As our coalition expands, particularly when the American people and African Americans and Hispanics and others understand that we’re going to tear down this phony ‘legal immigration’ where the oligarchs—the sociopathic overlords in Silicon Valley now led by the South Africans,” Bannon said, referring to H1-Bs. Bannon then got sidetracked, remarking about Musk and other foreign-born leaders in the tech industry: “That makes a lot of sense, doesn’t it? They’ve done such a great job in their country, they’ve come over here to tell us what to do in our country.” Bannon gave a similar rant to his Friday show listeners. He said then that he would like to see Trump put a moratorium on all immigration and work visas. “Over at Twitter, the South African has got to understand, the South Africans have to understand... suppression didn’t work in your own country, right?” Bannon said. “It’s not going to work here in the United States of America, OK. We’re free men and free women, and we’re winning right now and we’re going to continue to win and change these absurd and obscene, quite frankly, obscene policies. H1-B visa is obscene. We are calling for 100 percent moratorium on any immigration, any, for right now, full stop.” Bannon blamed H1-B visas as the reason there are so few Black and Hispanic men in tech. He even went as far as suggesting during Friday’s show that the competition brought in by visas may have led to the radicalization of the New Orleans terror suspect—a veteran with a tech background—who killed 14 early Wednesday morning. “What would happen if he had gotten an IT job and was able to perform in the IT job and got training in the IT job?” Bannon said Friday. “Would he have been radicalized? I don’t know.” Bannon also made clear again on Monday that he’s no fan of Johnson, despite the House Speaker being Trump’s pick for the position he was re-elected to on Friday. Some in the MAGA world have complained that Johnson was not effective enough during his first leadership stint. Bannon said he fears Johnson will cause unnecessary delays for Trump as he tries to push through his policy priorities. Bannon referred to the House Speaker as “Polly Pockets Johnson” and said that he is “sleazy.” He suggested the Louisiana lawmaker’s greatest skill is diverting blame for GOP failures to Trump—a realization he said he reached this weekend. “He’s great at sloughing off responsibility and blame to President Trump,” Bannon said. “He has an innate ability to actually shift blame of his failures to President Trump.” Bannon said he fears Republicans—under the leadership of Johnson—will try to pass an “omnibus” bill to usher in Trump’s policy goals like mass deportations, tax reform, and tariffs on foreign goods. A single bill can be picked apart by Democrats and will be subject to delays, Bannon argued. He said he has heard that such a bill, which originally was slated to be proposed as early as April, may not reach a House vote until Memorial Day. With that coming shortly before a summer recess, Bannon said that Trump’s most-pressing policy matters are at risk of being put on a side-burner until after Labor Day if they run into any sort of additional delays. “It’s too big,” Bannon said of the bill. “It’s too complicated. You, Johnson, have failed. Failed already.”",12,[],2025-01-06 23:03:02,2025-01-06 23:03:02

The British-American love story began when the co-stars first met on the set of ""Spiderman: Homecoming"" in 2017 — with the pair inhabiting the roles of Peter Parker and Michelle ""MJ"" Jones — and in acting out the franchises' most ""endgame"" hookup, they were bitten by the love bug in real life. Their relationship wouldn't be made official until 2021, when they traversed the globe arm in arm for ""Spiderman: No Way Home"" during their press tour. For the first time publically, the pair were inseparable while doing interviews together, answering questions about who cooks each other dinner and posting loved-up selfies. Unlike all the other ""Spidey"" couples who briefly dated on and off set — like the original Peter and MJ, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, and Peter and Gwen played by Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone — Holland and Zendaya seem like they are in it for the long haul. After nearly four years together, the co-stars and partners soft-launched their engagement via the flash of a massive rock on Zendaya's finger during the Golden Globes on Sunday. According to outlets like TMZ and People, a source close to the couple revealed that Holland proposed to Zendaya during the holidays. Just weeks later, Zendaya, nominated for a Golden Globe for her performance in ""Challengers,"" was spotted on the red carpet Sunday evening in a custom orange Louis Vuitton gown, a Bulgari choker and a matching ring on her right hand. However, watchful red carpet fans and reporters peeped another massive ring on her left ring finger. Per the Los Angeles Times, that specific ring was not mentioned in a Bulgari press release, highlighting the rest of the brand's jewelry Zendaya wore that night. On the carpet, a recently engaged LA Times reporter flashed her own engagement ring to the ""Challengers"" star and Zendaya played it cool. The coy actress reportedly smiled, flaunted her shimmering diamond ring back and shrugged her shoulders when asked if she was engaged. People Magazine also clocked that a tiny ""T"" tattoo for Tom is visible on the actress's ribcage, just barely peaking out of her dress. Ever since the ring's debut, Zendaya fans have been sleuthing online, looking for confirmation. One person pointed out that the five-carrot, $200,000 Jessica McCormack ring has been on Zendaya's radar since its release in 2022. The X post shows that the actress liked a photo of the ring almost three years ago. Another person highlighted that during the Globes, Zendaya showed her left hand to ""Challengers"" producer Amy Pascal. While the camera cut away from Pascal's reaction, Zendaya smiled as Pascal held her left hand. Even the streaming platform, Max, which hosts the smash Zendaya hit ""Euphoria"" had something to say about the engagement prior to it being confirmed by sources close to the couple. Max's social media account posted a clip of a viral scene from ""Euphoria"" with a photo of Zendaya's ring captioned: ""I have never, ever been happier."" In the video, Alexa Demie's character Maddie asks Rue (Zendaya), ""Rue, when was this?"" and she replies ""Right after New Year's."" ""The moment Zendaya knew she’d marry Tom Holland,"" one fan joked in a social media post of the now infamous video of Holland's viral ""Lip Sync Battle"" performance against Zendaya, where he danced in the rain in a corset singing to Rihanna's ""Umbrella."" This isn't the first time Zendaya has been at the center of engagement buzz although, this time, it looks like the rumors ended up being true. Last year, the 28-year-old posted a selfie to her Instagram story wearing a ring on her finger, but it was a false alarm for fans getting ahead of themselves. Zendaya immediately cleared up the confusion, saying, “I posted it for my hat… Like, not for the ring on my right finger, you guys. Seriously, you think that's how I would drop the deuce? Like, what?!” Zendaya's representatives have yet to comment on the engagement, but a family source confirmed to PEOPLE on Monday. And in other family planning, Holland hinted in an interview with Men's Health recently that the 28-year-old would like to settle down and leave acting at a certain point in his life. ""When I have kids, you will not see me in movies anymore,"" Holland said, adding: ""Golf and dad. And I will just disappear off the face of the earth."" Holland and Zendaya are set to film the fourth ""Spiderman"" film sometime later this year.",0,[],2025-01-06 23:03:02,2025-01-06 23:03:02

Chip Roy, a hardline Republican from Texas, told BI that it's time to put his ""foot on the gas"" for a stock trading ban.",Bryan Metzger,2025-01-06T21:06:25.000Z,"There's been little movement in recent years, especially in the House, on banning stock trading. That could change this year, with a group of hardline Republicans now pushing the issue. ""I need to put my foot on the gas a little bit,"" said Rep. Chip Roy. ""Let's deal with it."" For years, lawmakers in both parties have tried to pass legislation to ban members of Congress from trading stocks. It's popular with the American public. Both outgoing President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump support it. A bipartisan group of senators came together around a single stock trading ban bill this past summer, and two years ago, the House almost took a vote on a bill hastily put forward by House Democratic leadership. However, an actual floor vote in either chamber has long remained elusive. Now, some hardline House Republicans are hoping to change that. ""I'm tired of my colleagues sticking their heads in the sand on it. It needs to be dealt with, sooner rather than later,"" Rep. Chip Roy of Texas told Business Insider in a brief interview on Friday. Roy and 10 other members of the House Freedom Caucus board sent a letter to Speaker Mike Johnson on Friday expressing their ""sincere reservations"" with his tenure. Many of those lawmakers initially withheld their votes for Johnson, only to relent out of deference to Trump. In that letter, the GOP hardliners outlined a series of rule changes they wanted to see, along with policy items that they expected Johnson to put up for a vote. Among those items: Ending stock trading by members of Congress. ""If that's what it takes to gain some confidence by the public in the fact that members of Congress work ethically, then I think that's a small price to pay,"" Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, told BI. Roy has long been the leader GOP cosponsor of one of the leading bills to ban stock trading, the TRUST in Congress Act, and he told BI that it was his idea to add that demand to the letter. He also happens to be one of Johnson's chief critics, and could — in coordination with the other Republicans — threaten the speaker with a vote on his ouster if the House doesn't take up that legislation. As of now, it's not clear whether that will happen. Roy said that banning lawmakers from trading stocks is ""not as existential to the functioning of the average American family on a daily basis"" as some of the other priorities laid out in the letter, including steep cuts to federal spending and enacting tough border security and immigration measures. The Texas Republican did express frustration with the lack of progress on the issue over the last several years while hinting that this year could be different. ""It's been sitting out there for three or four years, we kind of keep dragging feet, and it's time to deal with it,"" said Roy. ""I need to put my foot on the gas a little bit, and so I'm putting my foot on the gas."" As of now, Roy says that ""foot on the gas"" involves laying out the demand and talking with Johnson and other relevant committee chairs about moving the legislation. Johnson, for his part, has not publicly expressed a position on a stock trading ban, and a spokesperson did not provide a position when contacted by Business Insider on Monday. His predecessor, former Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, did express support for a stock trading ban. ""The perception of Congress, whether true or not, is that some may take advantage of insider information,"" Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee, another Freedom Caucus letter signatory, told BI. ""This is a gesture to say, 'Hey, look, we're not treated any differently.'"" Despite widespread agreement on the principle, the details of an eventual ban aren't widely agreed upon, and different bills propose different things. Some legislation would ban the ownership of stocks altogether, but Ogles said that ""active day-trading"" is the real problem. ""It doesn't mean you can't own stock, so that you can't have mutual funds,"" Ogles said. Meanwhile, some House Freedom Caucus members still trade stocks, and one — Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida — violated a federal law requiring timely disclosure of stock trades in the fall of 2024. A September 2024 report from the Campaign Legal Center found that 44% of House members and 54% of senators own stock.

Jamie Raskin (D-MD) said. Harris pulled off her most awkward and painful duty to date as vice president as she declared the man who just months ago she called a “fascist” and “dangerous” the legitimate winner of the 2024 presidential election. Her language on Monday was much different than on the campaign trail. “Pursuant to the Constitution and the laws of the United States,” Harris declared from her perch standing shoulder to shoulder with House Speaker Mike Johnson as she announced her role in overseeing the quadrennial certification process. Former Vice President Mike Pence, who faced death threats on Jan. 6, 2021, praised Monday’s peaceful certification as a “hallmark of our democracy.” Harris appeared composed and carefree. She smiled and chatted amiably with Johnson, who barely survived a vote to keep his gavel on Friday, before the official certification got underway—a process that lasted under 45 minutes, unlike the marathon four years ago that was interrupted by bloody mayhem. Lawmakers gathered on the House floor during the joint session of Congress counted the votes, and certified the tally: 312 electoral votes for Trump; 226 for Harris. “I think we did demonstrate what fidelity to the Constitution looks like,” Raskin said. But he acknowledged “it was difficult to stomach his result in light of four years of lying about who had won in 2020.” Harris, who was a senator during the Jan. 6, 2021, certification that turned into an insurrection—when lawmakers literally ran for their lives, barricaded themselves in the House chamber and in their offices—mentioned not a word of it on Monday. “Today, I did what I have done my entire career, which is take seriously the oath that I have taken many times to support and defend the Constitution of the United States, which included, today, performing my constitutional duties to ensure that the people of America, the voters of America, will have their votes counted, that those votes matter and that they will determine, then, the outcome of an election,” Harris said after overseeing the certification of Donald J. Trump and JD Vance as president and vice president, respectively, of the United States of America. “It has to be difficult for her and other folks,” Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX) told the Daily Beast. “The mood was very different from four years ago, that’s an understatement.” Harris became the first losing presidential candidate since Al Gore to have to certify her opponent as the winner of a presidential election. Just a little over two months ago, Haris said during a CNN town hall that voters would prefer “not having a president of the United States who admires dictators and is a fascist.” “I believe that Donald Trump is dangerous,” she continued. “As the president of the United States, the commander in chief, he’s saying to his generals, in essence, why can’t you be more like Hitler’s generals? Come on!” The incoming commander in chief‘s team had the last word on Monday. Raskin said Democrats displayed baseline proper behavior for elected officials counting electoral votes on Jan. 6 this year. “We can feel proud that we’re not election deniers and that we didn’t mobilize violence and fraud to try to overthrow the election the way the Republicans did in 2020,” he said. “We acted as constitutional patriots.” The real test, he said, will come when Republicans lose their next presidential election. “It would be nice to think that what happened on Jan. 6, 2021, was this radical deviation and abhorration. But we won’t really know that until the Republicans lose an election and don’t recycle big lies and efforts to overturn the electoral process.”",39,[],2025-01-06 23:03:02,2025-01-06 23:03:02

The two first sparked dating rumors in 2023.,"Caralynn Matassa,Palmer Haasch",2025-01-06T20:52:39.000Z,"Kylie Jenner and Timothée Chalamet still seem to be going strong. The couple attended their second Golden Globe Awards together on Sunday. Here's a timeline of their relationship, from interacting at Paris Fashion Week to attending award shows. In what is arguably the most unexpected celebrity coupling since Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson, Kylie Jenner is dating Timothée Chalamet. Reports first surfaced in April 2023 that the two were casually seeing each other. In the time since, more information has come to light about their rumored first meeting and sources have given details on the relationship, though neither Jenner nor Chalamet have confirmed it publicly. Most recently, Chalamet and Jenner were spotted together at the 82nd Golden Globe Awards, held in Los Angeles in January 2025. Here's everything we know about their relationship so far, from when it may have started to the pair's secret taco dates. Representatives for Chalamet and Jenner didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. A video of Jenner and Chalamet from January that appeared to show them interacting during an event at Paris Fashion Week resurfaced in April, after the dating rumors began in full force. According to People, the video was taken at Jean Paul Gaultier's Paris Fashion Week show.  People reported that Jenner had again split from Travis Scott, the father of her two children, earlier in January, though the source told People it was ""probably not the end"" of Jenner and Scott's famously on-again, off-again relationship. Chalamet, for his part, had most recently been linked to model Sarah Talabi in 2022 and actor Eiza González in 2020. Shortly before the Kymothée relationship rumors took the internet by storm, Page Six reported on March 27 that Jenner's sister Kendall and rapper Bad Bunny (who'd themselves been at the center of dating rumors for about a month at that point) were photographed out together leaving a club in West Hollywood, California. The Page Six report mentioned in passing that Kendall and Bad Bunny had dinner ""alongside other A-Listers — including her sister, Kylie Jenner, and Timothée Chalamet,"" among others. On April 6, pop-culture gossip curator DeuxMoi posted an anonymous fan submission claiming that ""multiple sources"" had told them that Chalamet ""has a new girl... Kylie Jenner. ⚰️⚰️"" DeuxMoi soon followed that up with submissions from other readers who claimed they could confirm the news. One anonymous source told Deuxmoi they'd known about the pairing since Paris Fashion Week in January, indicating that the relationship may have started then.  The internet had a collective meltdown, with some expressing shock and horror at the unexpected pairing and others straight up refusing to believe that the two, who seem to run in very different social circles, had ever even met. According to photos from paparazzi agency Splash News reported on by Page Six and TMZ, Jenner and Chalamet had a ""secret date night"" at Tito's Tacos, a restaurant outside Los Angeles, that involved a kind of complicated car swap situation. Page Six reported that Jenner picked Chalamet up in her car after he attended an art show. One of Jenner's security guards then apparently drove Chalamet's car, which followed Jenner's car, to Tito's Tacos, at which point Jenner's team hopped out and brought tacos back to the car, according to TMZ. Jenner wasn't photographed during the reported date. On April 13, TMZ published photos from paparazzi agency Backgrid showing a black car, which they identified as Jenner's black Range Rover SUV, in the driveway of a house, which they identified as Chalamet's Beverly Hills, California, estate. Other publications, including the Daily Mail and Page Six, reported on the same photos. Page Six noted that the SUV had tinted windows and Jenner was never actually photographed inside the car, so it's unclear whether she was in it. The Daily Mail reported that the black SUV ""arrived around 10 a.m. and left mere minutes later"" followed by a ""blacked out security Escalade."" Jenner famously collects luxury cars and she's shown a preference for Range Rovers in the past. Representatives for Chalamet and Jenner didn't respond to requests for comment from TMZ, the Daily Mail, and Page Six at the time of the reports. Entertainment Tonight and People both separately reported on sources confirming the casual romance and giving more context for why Jenner and Chalamet were not going public. On April 14, People reported that ""a source close to 'The Kardashians' star"" confirmed that Jenner and Chalamet ""are hanging out and getting to know each other."" (Representatives for Jenner and Chalamet didn't respond to People's request for comment at the time.) Entertainment Tonight reported similar information from a source. ""They are keeping things casual at this point. It's not serious, but Kylie is enjoying hanging out with Timothée and seeing where it goes,"" said Entertainment Tonight's source in a story published April 17. ""It's been really fun for her because it feels a lot different than her past relationships. It's new and exciting for Kylie and she's having a lot of fun."" The two both attended Coachella mid-month but avoided being photographed together, Page Six reported. According to the Entertainment Tonight source, Jenner may have met Chalamet through her sister, Kendall, which tracks with their reported attendance at the March 27 dinner. ""Timothée is also friends with Kendall, so it's been easy for Kylie to integrate him into her life,"" the source told Entertainment Tonight. People reported on April 19 that a source close to Jenner said Jenner and Chalamet ""hang out every week"" and that Jenner is ""having fun"" and ""wants to date without any pressure"" after her on-and-off relationship with Travis Scott. The source also told People that the two had met ""earlier this year at an event in Europe,"" which tracks with the viral video of the two from Paris Fashion Week in January. Since the relationship reports broke, fans had been speculating that in true Kardashian-Jenner family style, the couple would make their big public debut in a splashy spectacle on the Met Gala red carpet. Alas, that didn't happen. Jenner did attend the Met Gala, but she went solo, and Chalamet skipped the fashion event altogether. After weeks of relative silence on the Chalamet-Jenner front, a source confirmed to People that the reality star and the ""Dune"" actor are still enjoying each other's company and not putting labels on their relationship. According to People's source, Jenner's main priority is being a mom to 5-year-old Stormi and 15-month-old Aire. A few days before People's report, Backgrid photos obtained by Page Six appeared to show the same black Range Rover (apparently Jenner's) from the April 13 sighting parked once again in the driveway of Chalamet's Beverly Hills home. On June 1, Page Six reported that Jenner had been photographed leaving Chalamet's house for the first time. In the photos taken by Splash News, Jenner can be seen in the driver's seat of her black Range Rover, glancing at her phone before driving away from Chalamet's home. Chalamet was photographed by the same paparazzo leaving in his own car shortly after Jenner departed. Footage obtained by TMZ shows the couple dancing, hugging, and kissing one another while taking in Beyoncé's Renaissance tour at Los Angeles' SoFi Stadium. In the background, Jenner's sister Kendall is also visible. This was the first time Chalamet and Jenner were actually seen interacting in public together. Another video of the two at the concert, obtained by PopCrave, shows Chalamet smoking a cigarette and chatting with Jenner. Chalamet and Jenner were photographed together at a US Open match in September 2023. In photographs from the event, the two are shown taking in the match, whispering in each other's ears, and even sharing a quick kiss. While the ""Dune"" star avoided mentioning Jenner by name, or even confirming their relationship, he told GQ's Daniel Riley that the intense scrutiny around his potential relationship reminded him of a ""South Park"" episode satirizing Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, in which the couple travels around the world on a ""Worldwide Privacy Tour"" demanding space from the public eye. ""Sometimes, people are going to be hella confused when you say you're trying to live a private life,"" Chalamet said in the interview. Jenner was honored at the ceremony for her work with her various lifestyle brands, including Kylie Cosmetics and Kylie Skin. Chalamet, for his part, presented an award to Martin Scorsese at the event. Chalamet and Jenner sat together, and were photographed smiling and talking to one another at the ceremony. According to a report published in People, Jenner and her mom Kris didn't walk the red carpet ahead of the Los Angeles premiere of ""Wonka."" Instead, they quietly entered the theater after the opening credits. Chalamet and Jenner were photographed smiling and kissing at the awards ceremony. As users on X (formerly known as Twitter) noted, the couple were frequently shown during the telecast of the event as well. E! News reported that Jenner attended the after-party for the premiere of ""A Complete Unknown.""  Citing an anonymous source, the publication reported that Chalamet was seen introducing Jenner to other members of the film's cast. Jenner and Chalamet attended the 82nd annual Golden Globes together. At the ceremony, Chalamet was  nominated for best performance by a male actor in a motion picture — drama, for his performance as Bob Dylan in ""A Complete Unknown."" During the ceremony, Jenner and Chalamet were also photographed with his ""A Complete Unknown"" costars Monica Barbaro and Elle Fanning.

Freeland, who served as Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister, criticized Trudeau in her resignation, slamming him for pursuing “costly political gimmicks” among Trump tariffs promises. Trudeau had claimed he would retaliate if Trump pursued a tariff hike and said it would be more difficult for the two countries to work together.

CES 2025 technically hasn't even started, but the AI product announcements and demos are already piling up. The biggest tech trade show in the US, formally known as the Consumer Electronics Show, kicks off Tuesday but has already led to news of AI integration in TVs, grills, and even bird feeders. Not everything that companies talk about at CES eventually makes it to market, but these announcements show the array of AI applications companies are exploring after the technology's explosive growth in popularity in 2024. Here are some of the biggest, coolest, and kookiest ones we've seen so far. Samsung and LG are bringing Microsoft's Copilot AI assistant to some of their smart TVs. Samsung's AI offerings include Click to Search, which can help identify an actor onscreen, and Live Translate, which provides subtitle translations in real time. LG says its newest OLED TVs have AI-enabled features that tailor audio and visual settings to a user's preferences. AI also welcomes users by name, and an AI Voice ID feature can identify users' voices to switch between profiles and recommend what to watch. LG says Copilot ""further streamlines the process, allowing users to efficiently find and organize complex information using contextual cues."" This isn't your granddad's grill.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/lifestyle/journaled-drinking-even-thought-being-201836464.html,"I journaled my drinking for a year. Even when I thought I was being sensible, I drank over the healthy limit.",,Health,INSIDER,3 min read,"I wrote down how much I drank in a daily journal. Half the time, I unknowingly went above the standards for moderate drinking.",Julia Pugachevsky,2025-01-06T20:18:36.000Z,"I tracked how much I drank every day for a year. Moderate drinking is one drink a day for women, not exceeding 7 a week. I exceeded that amount half the time, drinking more during the summer and holidays. In my head, I was great at drinking less in 2024. I rarely had more than two drinks per occasion, ordering more mocktails and N/A beers. My journal tells a different story. Back in 2023, I started writing down how many standard drinks I had per day in addition to my daily entries. I knew alcohol could impact my physical and mental health, so I wanted to factor it in to see how it altered my mood. After the US Surgeon General announced alcohol's link to cancer last week, I decided to crack the numbers over the whole year. While there's no safe amount of alcohol to consume, the National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention has guidelines for moderate drinking. Women shouldn't have more than one drink a day and seven total a week. For 26 out of 52 weeks, I went above that limit. Looking back, I saw patterns around when I'd drink and how I felt before and after. Going into 2025, it's convinced me to become ""dry by default"" and create tighter rules around drinking. I have never blacked out. I also never drink alone and rarely in my home, unless we have guests over. Still, I got a 50% moderate drinking grade for 2024 — a big F. Because there were times I had three drinks throughout the whole day, I had only one memory of actually being drunk — one I excused in my mind because it was at a wedding. The times I had four drinks in a day, no matter how spaced out they were or how sober I felt, qualified as heavy drinking for women, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Part of the issue was my own knowledge of what qualified as healthy. I didn't know that I should cap myself at one drink a day — I always aimed for two max, which is the healthy limit for men. The periods I drank the most were early summer and the holidays when I had the most plans. I also got married this year and had a few small events to celebrate, which led to more drinking. There are social benefits to drinking in moderation. The problem is when I'm having a good time after one glass of wine, I often want to maximize that feeling by ordering one more. Even when I limited myself to two drinks per occasion, those cocktails added up when I went out four times a week. My healthiest drinking periods coincided with training for my first marathon. I often had only a few drinks the whole week because I was getting up early to run four times a week, and I abstained from drinking the week before the race. As an added bonus, I looked less puffy in my wedding photos. Giving up alcohol is the hardest for me when it feels like a punishment, like I'm removing some pleasure from my life for the nebulous goal of being healthier. It was much easier to order that Phony Negroni when I had a higher purpose or goal. It made me feel dedicated and confident. I was someone who could hang with my friends and still make it to that morning run. Now, I'm doing Dry January and plan to continue when the month is up. The biggest shock from tracking my data isn't that I drank more than I thought; it's how much happier and more fulfilled I was when I didn't at all.

For some stars, abstaining from alcohol and drugs comes after overcoming addiction. Bradley Cooper, Tom Holland, Jessica Simpson, and more stars have spoken about their sobriety. Some celebrities are open about personal hardships, like efforts to abstain from alcohol and drugs. Actors like Jamie Lee Curtis, Bradley Cooper, and Anthony Hopkins have been sober for over a decade, while stars like Tom Holland and Lucy Hale have been candid about embarking on their sobriety journeys in recent years. Others, including Dax Shepard and Kelly Osbourne, have been honest about the challenges of maintaining their sober lifestyle. Here are 40 celebrities who have spoken about their sobriety. Anjelica Oswald contributed to a previous version of this article. Bradley Cooper Cooper has been sober since he was 29. He told GQ in 2013 that he got sober because he realized that ""if I continued it, I was really going to sabotage my whole life."" Cooper played a musician struggling with addiction in 2018's ""A Star Is Born,"" which he also directed. He told Variety that it was a ""cathartic"" experience. ""Anytime you're trying to tell the truth you need to go to places and use things that have happened to you, or you've read about or experienced,"" he said. ""And that's all part of the beauty of turning whatever things you've gone through into a story. I find that to be very cathartic."" During an appearance on a 2023 episode of ""Running Wild With Bear Grylls: The Challenge,"" Cooper said that he was ""very lucky"" to overcome his addictions. Cooper also said he was grateful to be sober when he played Jackson Maine in ""A Star Is Born."" ""Thank goodness I was at a place in my life where I was at ease with all of that, so I could really let myself go,"" he said. ""I've been very lucky with the roles I've had to play. It's been a real blessing. I hope I get to keep doing it."" Tom Holland Holland spoke about his decision to become sober during an appearance on the podcast ""On Purpose With Jay Shetty,"" released in July 2023. After having a ""very boozy December,"" the British actor chose to participate in Dry January. During that time, Holland found that he kept thinking about drinking, ""and it just really scared me,"" to the point that he realized he has a dependency. Holland said he was ""definitely addicted to alcohol"" and didn't know how to navigate social settings without drinking. ""I was really, really struggling and I started to really worry that maybe I had an alcohol problem. So I decided that I would wait until my birthday, which is June 1,"" the actor said. ""I said to myself, 'If I can do six months without alcohol, then I can prove to myself that I don't have a problem.' And by the time I got to June 1, I was the happiest I've ever been in my life."" ""It's honestly been the best thing I've ever done,"" Holland added. ""I'm a year and a half into it now. It doesn't even cross my mind. I've found amazing replacements that I think are fantastic, ones that are also really healthy."" Holland's sobriety also led him to launch Bero, a premium non-alcoholic beer brand in 2024. Jamie Campbell Bower ""12 and a half years ago I was in active addiction,"" the ""Stranger Things"" star wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, in July 2022. ""Hurting myself and those around me who I loved the most. It got so bad that eventually I ended up in a hospital for mental health. I am now 7 1/2 years clean and sober."" ""I have made many mistakes in my life, but each day is a chance to start again. Atone for mistakes and grow,"" he continued. ""For anyone who wakes up thinking 'oh god not again' I promise you there's a way."" ""I'm so grateful to be where I am, I'm so grateful to be sober,"" he said. ""I'm so grateful to be. Remember, we are all works in progress."" Jessica Simpson Simpson celebrated seven years of sobriety in November. ""I was at a place where I was literally spiraling with the alcohol and I was missing out on moments with my children, and then they were seeing me and they were very confused,"" Simpson said during an appearance on ""The Kelly Clarkson Show"" in 2020. ""I just wanted to be present and have clarity and be a good role model for my children, because I always wanted to be a good role model for the world, so why in the world would I be stuck in this cycle of having to wake up and have a drink before going to one of their school assemblies?"" she continued. ""It got to the point where all of my life has escalated and I couldn't suppress it,"" Simpson said. ""And alcohol, it wasn't working. It was making me completely check out."" The star said that when she stopped drinking, she had ""so much clarity.""  Eminem Eminem, real name Marshall Mathers, almost died from an accidental overdose of the drug methadone in 2007. He later entered rehab and celebrated 12 years of sobriety in April 2020. Eminem opened up about his addictions in a 2022 essay for XXL magazine, saying that drugs became ""a part of the way I was living my life"" once he got signed to a record label. The rapper recounted going to Tijuana multiple times to get drugs like Vicodin because it was ""so easy to go back and forth to do it."" He said the ""heaviest drug usage and addiction spanned only about five years of my life."" His addiction worsened following the release of ""The Marshall Mathers LP,"" as he was readying for his ""Encore"" album. ""I was taking Vicodin, Valium, and alcohol,"" Eminem said. At one point, the rapper said he was taking 75 to 80 Valiums ""a night."" During an appearance on Paul Rosenberg's ""Paul Pod"" podcast in 2022, Eminem spoke about how his life changed when he got clean while working on his ""Relapse"" album. ""I remember when I first got sober and all the shit was out of my system, I remember just being, like, really happy and everything was fucking new to me again,"" he said. ""It was the first album and the first time that I had fun recording in a long time."" Robert Downey Jr. Robert Downey Jr. was arrested multiple times on drug-related charges over the span of a few years in the late '90s. He later spent time at the California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison and has focused on staying sober since. ""Job one is get out of that cave,"" he told Vanity Fair in 2014. ""A lot of people do get out but don't change. So the thing is to get out and recognize the significance of that aggressive denial of your fate, come through the crucible forged into a stronger metal."" Rob Lowe Rob Lowe received the Spirit of Sobriety award in 2015 to celebrate 25 clean years. ""Being in recovery has given me everything of value that I have in my life,"" Lowe said when accepting the award. ""Integrity, honesty, fearlessness, faith, a relationship with God, and most of all gratitude. It's given me a beautiful family and an amazing career. I'm under no illusions where I would be without the gift of alcoholism and the chance to recover from it."" Calvin Harris DJ and producer Calvin Harris told the BBC that he stopped drinking at 24 because it was affecting his work. ""I wasn't an alcoholic or anything like that, but it was clearly affecting what I do,"" he said. ""My live shows are a million times better now. If you drink, you can't even remember if it's a good show or not — and that's probably for the best, because it would have been rubbish because I'd have been drunk and not making any sense."" Lucy Hale Hale told Byrdie that she decided to quit drinking after spending a few years in the party scene. ""I'm just always trying to surround myself with better people and be the best version of myself possible,"" she said. ""I know it sounds obnoxious to hear people say that, but why not?"" Hale celebrated three years of sobriety with an Instagram post in January 2025. Hale said that since choosing to abstain from alcohol, ""I've experienced moments that can only be described as pure miracles and magic."" ""I am deeply grateful every day—for the people who have been guiding lights, for a power greater than myself that loves me unconditionally, and for my own perseverance in not giving up,"" she wrote. ""To all of you who have supported my journey, I have felt your love and it means everything to me."" Daniel Radcliffe In a conversation with Marc Maron for his ""WTF"" podcast in 2015, Daniel Radcliffe opened up about his alcohol addiction. ""There was definitely a time when I was coming out of 'Potter' and I was into the real world, suddenly I was in a world where I'm not going to have that consistency anymore,"" he said. ""I was pretty inconsolable on the last day of 'Potter.' I was really worried. I was living alone, and I think I was really freaked out ... I drank a lot, as has been recorded."" Lana Del Rey In an interview with British GQ in 2012, Lana Del Rey spoke about her struggles with alcohol and drugs as an underage teen. ""That's really why I got sent to boarding school aged 14 — to get sober,"" she said. ""I was a big drinker at the time. I would drink every day. I would drink alone. ... I knew it was a problem when I liked it more than I liked doing anything else."" She eventually ended up at a rehab center for drug and alcohol addicts when she was 18. Ben Affleck Affleck first checked into rehab in 2001 and has continued to work on his sobriety through the years. In March 2017, the actor took to his Facebook page to talk about going back to rehab. ""I have completed treatment for alcohol addiction; something I've dealt with in the past and will continue to confront,"" he wrote. ""I want to live life to the fullest and be the best father I can be."" His ex-wife, Jennifer Garner, took him to rehab again in August 2018. In a 2020 interview with The New York Times, Affleck named Bradley Cooper and Robert Downey Jr. as ""guys who have been very supportive and to whom I feel a great sense of gratitude."" He also said that it ""took me a long time to fundamentally, deeply, without a hint of doubt, admit to myself that I am an alcoholic."" Brad Pitt In a 2017 interview with GQ, the actor talked about quitting drinking. ""I mean, we have a winery. I enjoy wine very, very much, but I just ran it to the ground,"" he said. ""I had to step away for a minute. And truthfully I could drink a Russian under the table with his own vodka. I was a professional. I was good."" Kristin Davis. Davis spoke with Health magazine about her addiction in 2010. ""I'm a recovering alcoholic,"" she said. ""I've never hid it, but I've been sober the whole time I've been famous, so it wasn't like I had to go to rehab publicly."" Keith Urban Keith Urban told Rolling Stone in 2016 that he turned to drugs and drinking in the late '90s. ""I stepped up my drinking. I started doing more drugs,"" he said. ""Yeah, man. The whole back end of the '90s were just awful."" He added: ""You know, early on in my sobriety, there was a period when I wished I hadn't succumbed to drugs and everything the way I did. It sucked up so much creative time, when I should have been in the studio working. But I don't know what came from that time, other than that I'm where I am because of, or in spite of, nobody knows and never will."" Joe Manganiello ""I battled with addiction at a young age and got to the other side of that,"" he told Haute Living in 2015. ""That's an ongoing battle. I think there's a story in there somewhere about trying to find my way through that and making it to where I am today."" In 2018, he accepted a Spirit of Sobriety award. ""Sixteen years ago … I crashed and washed ashore on the banks of sobriety,"" he said. ""When I was growing up, when I thought of an alcoholic, I thought of some toothless old guy in a trench coat in a basement somewhere. I just never thought that would apply to me. That type of stigma kept me from getting the help that I needed when I knew I needed it."" Gerard Butler Butler spoke to Men's Journal in 2012 about being 15 years sober then. He said he went to rehab before he could reach full-blown pill addiction. ""Maybe a stronger person wouldn't have needed to go,"" he said. ""When you hear the word rehab, you think, 'He's a mess, he's fucked up.' But I'm glad I did it. I've made a shitload of wrong decisions in my life. But I know I've made some right ones as well."" Tobey Maguire In 2003, the actor opened up to Playboy about being a recovering alcoholic and going to Alcoholics Anonymous. ""It's just all practical,"" he said. ""There are no holes in the program. It's so, so simple. I come in, I ask for help. It has totally changed my life."" Russell Brand Brand went on ""Megyn Kelly Today"" to discuss his recovery in 2017. He previously had an addiction to heroin and alcoholism. ""When I started, I took it one day at a time,"" he said. ""Ultimately, I found that spirituality worked for me."" He celebrated 20 years of sobriety in December 2022. ""I'm 20 years clean and sober today,"" the comedian said on Instagram. ""Thank you to all the people who have helped me to remain clean. It's never done on your own."" Ewan McGregor Ewan McGregor has been sober since 2001. He told Playboy in 2005 that he stopped drinking before it could ruin his life. ""I knew I was lucky, and somehow I knew that if I didn't stop, everything would go tits up — my career, my family, my everything,"" he said. Naomi Campbell Vogue reported that the model didn't know if she'd make it through the early 2000s. ""The time between 1998 and 2005 was especially bad,"" she said. ""During that time I avoided looking in the mirror, because I didn't like the person who was looking back at me. To be honest, there were times I thought I wouldn't survive. I used to have a lot of problems. Amongst others I drank too much so I joined Alcoholics Anonymous to get and stay sober."" She is also a member of Narcotics Anonymous. ""It doesn't matter what walk of life — addiction and alcoholism doesn't discriminate,"" she said at the Fortune Most Powerful Women International Summit in 2017. Colin Farrell During an appearance on ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show"" in 2017, Farrell celebrated his recovery. Farrell reportedly checked into rehab again in 2018 as a preventive measure when he began to feel urges, according to The Sun. He spoke about getting clean in a 2021 interview with The Irish Times, saying: ""After 15 or 20 years of carousing the way I caroused and drinking the way I drank, the sober world is a pretty scary world."" ""To come home and not to have the buffer support of a few drinks just to calm the nerves, it was a really amazing thing,"" Farrell added. Tim McGraw Tim McGraw quit drinking in 2008 when his family and friends began to worry about him. ""When your wife tells you it's gone too far, that's a big wake-up call,"" he told Men's Health.""That, and realizing you're gonna lose everything you have. Not monetarily, not career-wise, but family-wise. I drank too much. I partied too much. And did other things too much."" Tom Hardy Hardy has been sober since he was 25. The actor sobered up in 2003 by using a 12-step program. He told Esquire it was his ""first port of call."" ""It was hard enough for me to say, 'I'm an alcoholic,'"" he said. ""But staying stopped is fucking hard."" Kelly Osbourne Osbourne relapsed in 2021, after almost four years of sobriety. ""I am an addict and had thought that I had enough time under my belt and I could drink like a normal person, and it turns out I cannot and I will never be normal,"" Osbourne told Extra at the time. ""This is something I am going to battle for the rest of my life,"" she added. ""It's never going to be easy."" She celebrated one year of sobriety the following year. ""What a difference a year can make!"" she wrote on Instagram. ""If you would have told me 365 days ago that I would be sober, happy, and about to be a mumma I would have laughed in your face. Life is truly amazing when you do the work. Thank you to everyone that has supported me on this journey."" John Goodman Goodman struggled with alcoholism for years and even drank while filming the original ""Roseanne."" At one point, star Roseanne Barr confronted him about it. While on Howard Stern's SiriusXM show in March 2018, Goodman said, ""She was scared for me, but she was more confrontational. She'd already had a husband go through the process."" He added: ""The last four years were pretty bad, and I was drinking at work and [Barr] was scared for me. I was ashamed of myself, but I couldn't stop."" Dax Shepard In 2012, Shepard told Playboy that he struggled with an addiction to drugs and alcohol. He said that from the ages of 18 to 29, he was a ""heavy smoker, heavy drinker, drug addict, terrible eater, and philanderer."" ""I just loved to get fucked-up — drinking, cocaine, opiates, marijuana, diet pills, pain pills, everything,"" he told Playboy. ""Mostly my love was Jack Daniel's and cocaine."" He said that he'd get sober for some movie roles but then get right back into his drug and alcohol habits. Shepard's wife Kristen Bell wrote an emotional post on Instagram in September 2018 to celebrate his 14th year of sobriety. ""I know how much you loved using. I know how much it got in your way. And I know, because I saw, how hard you worked to live without it,"" she wrote. ""I will forever be in awe of your dedication, and the level of fierce moral inventory you perform on yourself, like an emotional surgery, every single night...'m so proud that you have never been ashamed of your story, but instead shared it widely, with the hope it might inspire someone else to become the best version of themselves."" In 2020, Shepard revealed on his podcast, ""Armchair Expert,"" that he relapsed after 16 years of sobriety following a motorcycle accident that resulted in him using painkillers. At the time of the episode's release, the actor was seven days sober. Stephen Moyer The ""True Blood"" star stopped drinking and went into rehab after the birth of his first son. ""I got to a point in my life where I was totally out of control,"" he told The Telegraph in 2017. "" I was shocked into doing something about it and fatherhood was definitely a big aspect of that —the catalyst that shook me. And I would never want to go back there."" He added: ""People, say, 'When are you going to be able to have a drink again?' And my answer to that is, 'I've already drunk all the drinks that I was supposed to drink in one lifetime.'"" John Mayer Following Drake's 30th birthday party, Mayer was hungover for six days. It was after that experience that he decided to stop drinking. ""I looked out the window and I went, 'OK, John, what percentage of your potential would you like to have? Because if you say you'd like 60, and you'd like to spend the other 40 having fun, that's fine,"" he told Complex. ""'But what percentage of what is available to you would you like to make happen? There's no wrong answer. What is it?' I went, '100.'"" During a 2022 interview on the podcast ""Call Her Daddy,"" Mayer said that he hasn't really dated since getting sober. ""I don't think I have to, to be quite honest,"" he said. ""I quit drinking like six years ago, so I don't have the liquid courage. I just have dry courage."" Dennis Quaid Quaid opened up about his cocaine addiction in an interview with The Sunday Times in 2018. ""I liked coke,"" he said. ""I liked it to go out. I missed it for quite a while. I was doing about two grams a day."" He said he was ""lucky"" to get a sign that led him to rehab. ""I had one of those white-light experiences where I saw myself being dead and losing everything I had worked for my whole life, so I put myself in rehab,"" he said. He stopped drinking for 10 years while kicking his drug addiction but later got back into alcohol. ""I started drinking again, because alcohol was never my problem,"" he said. ""I never liked the feeling of being drunk. I would do coke and I would use alcohol to come down."" Charlie Sheen Sheen has struggled with alcohol and drug addiction for years. He quit doing cocaine and drinking for 11 years, but he told Dr. Oz in 2016 that he relapsed following his HIV diagnosis. ""It was to suffocate the anxiety and what my life was going to become with this condition and getting so numb I didn't think about it,"" he said. ""It was the only tool I had at the time, so I believed that would quell a lot of that angst. A lot of that fear. And it only made it worse."" The actor told Us Weekly in 2019 that his daughter helped him realize he needed to get sober. ""It was a Sunday. My daughter called and said, 'I need to get to this appointment immediately,' and I'd already had a few drinks,"" he said. Sheen called a friend to drive because he couldn't. ""On the drive back, I was just like, 'Damn, man, I'm not available. I'm just not responsible, and there's no nobility in that,'"" he said. ""It was that night, I just sat with all that."" Sheen continued: ""If you can't be available for the basic necessity of being there for your children, then something really needs to shift. It was that next day that I said, 'All right. It's time. Let's give this a shot.' And then a month went by, a couple months went by, I'm [like], 'Alright. This feels good. This feels good.'"" The actor also told Jay Leno in 2019 that his sobriety ""didn't require anything super dramatic and crazy and front-page news."" Zac Efron Back in 2013, Efron went to rehab for an alcohol addiction. ""I was drinking a lot, way too much,"" he told The Hollywood Reporter about a year after his stint at rehab. ""It's never one specific thing. I mean, you're in your 20s, single, going through life in Hollywood, you know? Everything is thrown at you."" He joined Alcoholics Anonymous and started seeing a therapist to help him on his journey, but added that battling addictions is a ""never-ending struggle."" He told Elle in 2016 that getting sober provided him with ""structure"" in his life.  Jamie Lee Curtis Curtis has been sober for more than 20 years. In an interview with People magazine in 2018, Curtis revealed that she became addicted to opioids for 10 years following minor plastic surgery in 1989. ""I was ahead of the curve of the opiate epidemic,"" Curtis told the magazine. ""I had a 10-year run, stealing, conniving. No one knew. No one."" Her husband didn't even know until she went to her first recovery meeting in 1999. ""Getting sober remains my single greatest accomplishment,"" Curtis said. ""Bigger than my husband, bigger than both of my children, and bigger than any work, success, failure. Anything."" Josh Brolin Brolin entered rehab in 2013 and honored his five-year anniversary of being sober with an emotional Instagram post detailing a horrific night he was drunk. ""Drunk: when you think you're having a rip roaring time and the next morning you wake up and your brain has broken into a frenzied beehive, and your body is shattered shards of sharp glass desperately searching for what fits where and your spirit is being eaten by worms with great white bloodied teeth and your heart has shriveled into a black prune churning your intestines to the point where dysentery feels attractive,"" he wrote. He continued: ""And you can't remember anything you did so you roll out of bed over last night's urine and you dial your best friend's phone number because you recall him lifting you over his head, your whole self, before you hit and broke through the drywall and, you think, a large aquarium and the phone on the other end rings and he picks it up, that clambering for a phone, the clumsiness of a hardline, and you say: 'What did I do last night?!' and he answers, after a great pause: '…Dude…'. #5years."" In 2021, he celebrated his sobriety by posting a photo of his younger self, accompanied by a lengthy caption. ""Sobriety is finally loving without every thought being about how it affects only you,"" he said in part. ""Sobriety is a moment of being able to love and be consumed by the glee it brings someone else. Sobriety is knowing the difference between selfishness and integrity."" In his 2024 memoir ""From Under the Truck,"" Brolin said that he hit rock bottom when he visited his sickly 99-year-old grandmother while intoxicated. ""I knew that was going to be the last time I drank,"" he wrote. ""I love being sober,"" Brolin added. ""I have more fun. There's nothing that I go through that I am absolutely certain wouldn't be worse if I was drinking."" Rob Delaney ""It's almost two decades,"" Delaney shared on Instagram in February 2022. ""And I'm shocked and overwhelmed and grateful."" ""Twenty years ago I was in jail in a wheelchair and now I'm on a couch, with a lovely quilt, and my life is unrecognizable,"" he said. ""I got a lot of help from a lot of wonderful people,"" the actor added. ""I started doing volunteer work after I'd been sober for a while, and through that I met my wife 18 years ago, and we've had so many children together. And I had the courage to pursue the career that I really wanted to."" Delaney lost his two-year-old son Henry in 2018 and credited his sobriety with helping him experience grief. ""Sobriety allowed me to be a reasonably good dad, husband, and worker through it all,"" he said on X in 2019, when he celebrated 17 years. ""Sobriety allows me to grieve fully, and grief is an expression of love."" John Stamos The actor spoke about his sobriety while presenting ""Full House"" costar Jodie Sweetin with the Writers In Treatment's Experience, Strength and Hope Award for her advocacy work for people in recovery.

Elton John In a 2019 Instagram post, John wrote that ""29 years ago today, I was a broken man. I finally summoned up the courage to say 3 words that would change my life: 'I need help.'"" ""Thank you to all the selfless people who have helped me on my journey through sobriety,"" he said. ""I am eternally grateful."" John reflected on his addiction in a 2019 interview with Variety, saying that he ""had reached the lowest ebb in my life — the absolute bottom."" ""I hated myself so much,"" he said. ""I was consumed with shame. All I wanted to do was get well. I put all of the energy I had left toward my recovery."" Kit Harington In an interview with GQ Hype, Kit Harington said that pre-sobriety, it was ""physically and emotionally impossible for me not to drink again,"" and he's ""lucky"" he got clean before parenthood. (Harington shares a son and a daughter with his wife and ""Game of Thrones"" costar Rose Leslie.) ""The very fact that I can be proud of it is an achievement,"" he said, explaining that he used to be self-loathing and despise himself. ""So the fact that I am proud of getting sober is in and of itself a mark of being an entirely different person."" Harington added that his sobriety has positively affected his work life, too. ""And now, every set I step onto, whatever work I do, I'm proud of, because I know I put everything into it,"" he said. ""Whereas before I had this huge monkey on my back that was just, like, weighing me down. So yeah, the whole nature of being proud of myself is a relatively new prospect for me."" Flavor Flav Flavor Flav, whose real name is William Jonathan Drayton Jr., has been sober since 2020. On World Mental Health Day in October, he shared an Instagram post days ahead of celebrating four years of sobriety. ""My mental health is an important part of my sobriety journey,"" he said. The musician said that he speaks to two therapists: a real one and an AI therapist, whom he uses between his hectic schedule and work travels. Anthony Hopkins Days before turning 87 in late December, Hopkins shared an encouraging message about his sobriety and the moment he had a wake-up call. ""I was having such fun,"" Hopkins said in a video shared on Instagram. ""But then I realized I was in big, big trouble because I couldn't remember anything and I was driving a car drunk out of my skull."" ""Then on that fatal day, I realized I needed help. So I got it,"" he added. ""I phoned up a group of people like me — alcoholic. And that was it. Sober. I've had more fun these 49 years than ever.""

During this time, some individuals entered the Capitol, took photos, and explored the building before leaving,” Collins continued,  sanewashing the violent siege that led to the deaths of five people, cost taxpayers more than $2 million, and set off a delayed-released coup that finally came to fruition with Trump’s return to the White House. The Georgia Republican stayed strapped to the soapbox, lamenting the “peaceful protestors” who’d been tried for their participation in the violent insurrection. “Since then, hundreds of peaceful protestors have been hunted down, arrested, held in solitary confinement, and treated unjustly. Countless hours and taxpayer dollars have been spent pursuing innocent grandmothers and raiding President Trump’s home, while terrorists and millions of illegal immigrants continue to cross our nation’s borders, causing havoc in our communities,” Collins wrote. “Thankfully, President Trump has announced that, on day one of his presidency, he will grant pardons to nonviolent defendants.” Collins has a penchant for pathetic posting. In October, he inexplicably posted a highly-edited “Chad”-ified image of JD Vance that slimmed down his jaw and brought his chin to a point implant-like point. Trump has repeatedly vowed to mass-pardon his supporters who ransacked the U.S. Capitol within his first days in office, a promise that inspired his supporters to try—so far unsuccessfully—to get their sentences delayed until after he officially enters office later this month.",52,[],2025-01-06 23:04:35,2025-01-06 23:04:35

Conventional wisdom is that the windfall skyrockets the Netflix musical to frontrunner status for Best Picture at the Oscars. It also primes the film for what typically accompanies that designation: becoming award season’s biggest villain. Every award season, a major contender emerges as the film that the Very Online among movie fans love to hate, for various reasons on a spectrum of legitimacy and fairness. Sometimes it seems to tangibly affect a movie’s awards hopes. (See: Maestro last year.) Sometimes it doesn’t matter at all. (Dear God, Green Book.) Especially after its Globes haul, the Emila Pérez dissent, which had already been bubbling throughout the fall festival season, has been amplified. The film, which can now be streamed on Netflix, is a largely Spanish-language musical written and directed by French filmmaker Jacques Audiard. It centers around a Mexican cartel leader who enlists the help of a lawyer to help her relocate and rebuild her life safely, and then achieve her dream of transitioning to a woman. (Again, it’s a musical…) Zoe Saldaña, Selena Gomez, and Karla Sofía Gascón star, with Gascón currently predicted to be the first transgender performer to be nominated for Best Actress at the Oscars. The wild swings in tone, set to song, isn’t for everybody. And there has been a groundswell of criticism over what some argue is the film’s superficial handling—or, some say, mishandling—of gender and cultural identity. After Sunday night’s Globes telecast, one clip of a musical number in particular has gone viral and, at least out of context, is being roasted as proof that the film doesn’t deserve its accolades. In the clip, Saldaña’s character speak-sings (raps?) with doctors because she wants “to learn about sex-change operations.” As they do a choreographed walk through a hospital patient bay, the doctor explains, “Man to woman. Woman to man.” And then, deepening his voice for flair, “Penis to vaginaaaaaaa.” The clip is, again, out of context from the rest of the film, and therefore especially cringey. That also makes it, however, perfect fodder for Emilia Pérez critics to roast the film and complain about its awards sweep. “*this* winning over wicked in this particular category is laughable,” one X user posted. “THIS just won the #goldenglobe for best picture over anora, the substance, wicked and challengers…” another posted. For people who haven’t seen the film, the viral clip isn’t making the best first impression: “this is the first clip i’ve ever seen of emilia perez (not even watched the trailers) and what on earth is this.” Those who have seen the movie are more specific and pointed in their critiques. “Emilia Perez a film about mexicans, directed by a french man, played by americans, with a protagonist from spain, with a sinopsis [sic] that portrays harmful stereotypes of mexican/latin culture, winning best international film seems like a joke,” one user posted. “For my friends who follow me but aren’t tapped into movies as much this movie is technically the front runner for winning the Oscar now, a transphobic liberal co-opt of gender and race in a year filled with incredible movies about trans and poc stories,” posted another. Reactions to the clip and the movie’s Globes success have otherwise run the gamut from shock at the content of the scene to bemusement over the inevitable backlash its awards haul would get from people on Film Twitter. It remains to be seen what effect Globes night will have on Emilia Pérez’s awards chances. The evening is a tangible, valuable boost for the film, which, while it’s been a fixture of the festival season, is now on a mainstream radar in a way that it hadn’t been before. That means that more people will watch it, especially since it’s readily available to stream on Netflix. Is a higher profile a good thing for its prospects? Or does it leave the film open to more, forgive the word, discourse. It’s worth noting that a film this polarizing has, by the nature of what it means to be polarizing, passionate supporters. (Clearly. It’s won and been nominated for a slew of awards.) The Globes telecast also gave its cast and creative team an opportunity to speak to the historic nature of what it would mean for the film and its stars to continue to win trophies and be given televised platforms. “I chose these colors tonight—the Buddhist colors—because I have a message for you,” Gascón, who was the last person to speak during the telecast before host Nikki Glaser said goodnight, said. She was the first openly trans performer to be nominated in her category. “The light always wins over darkness. You can put us in jail, you can beat us up, but you can never take away our soul or our resistance or our identity. I want to say to you, raise your voice and say that I won, I am who I am, not who you want [me to be].” In an interview with Vanity Fair that was published Monday, Gascón addressed the backlash, saying, “Many are running a negative, nasty campaign against the film, so anything that I say, they will use it to make their case bigger.” As for the clips that have been taken out of context, Gascón said, “When something has a big impact and is liked by many, others hate it just for existing.”",0,[],2025-01-06 23:04:35,2025-01-06 23:04:35

Instead of going home for Christmas, I ditched my family for my dream trip to Ireland.",,Lifestyle,INSIDER,4 min read,"After moving from the US to Spain, I decided not to go home for the holidays, which gave me plenty of time to take a dream trip to Ireland.",Shayna Conde,2025-01-06T20:04:01.000Z,"I moved from the US to Spain, and instead of going home for the holidays, I went to Ireland. I didn't do a ton of planning, but I decided to limit my trip to West Cork and Dublin. I had such a great time and met lots of friendly fellow travelers along the way. Last year, I moved from New Jersey to Spain. As much as I love my family, being in the US stresses me out. Instead of flying home, I wanted to experience something new this holiday season that would hopefully be a salve to the constant political disappointment I've been feeling as a Black woman living in the country. Although Barcelona (my current city) comes alive during December with Christmas markets, festive lights, and a wave of tourists, I was craving greenery, the tranquility of nature, and maybe a sprinkle of luxury (at least for a few days). I knew I'd find that in Ireland, which I've loved every time I've visited. Less than a month before Christmas, I did some last-minute planning to make my dream trip a reality. I've been to Ireland a few times, and multiple people I've met abroad have encouraged me to visit West Cork. The somewhat underrated foodie destination is covered in farmland and remnants of Ireland's once-abundant temperate rainforests. My curiosity was fully piqued, so I booked an extended weekend at Liss Ard Estate in the town of Skibbereen. The luxurious estate was a bit of a splurge for me — the cheapest suites start at 160 euros, or about $166, a night — but I considered it a Christmas gift to myself. I hoped to spend time in nature during my trip, but I wasn't expecting to see greenery similar to ""Jurassic Park"" in the winter Irish countryside. I spent most of my time in West Cork wandering the Irish Sky Garden, which James Turrell created in the 1990s. I didn't even know about the internationally renowned masterpiece of interactive natural art when I booked my stay, but it's safe to say I was forever changed by the beautiful installation. The Sky Garden is basically just a giant concave oval. When standing inside it, the sounds of nature are amplified, and the sky turns into a massive portrait. As I lay on the rock slab, staring at the sky and hearing blades of grass shuffle in the breeze, I was reminded how wonderful it is to just be present in the moment. I loved the solitude of West Cork, but I planned on spending Christmas Day in Dublin, more specifically, at Jacob's Inn. I've stayed in this hostel every time I've visited Dublin. As an avid solo traveler, I rarely find accommodations that organically create the feeling of family among strangers, but this place does it for me every time. Immediately after entering and putting my bags in storage, I met a travel buddy at the bar who mildly peer-pressured me into going to a reggaeton club (something I didn't even know existed in Dublin). We had a blast. Although Dublin was crowded with a wave of holiday tourists and locals gathering with friends and family, I was still able to carve out dedicated time to rest, regroup, and explore the city at my own pace. Two of my favorite adventures were finding The Little Pig Speakeasy and visiting the city's museums. The four properties of the National Museum of Ireland and the National Gallery are all free to the public, so I took my time wandering through as many exhibits as I could. The speakeasy was the most authentic-feeling one I've been to in years. To enter, my hostel buddy and I had to find a pay phone, type three numbers, say a code that we got from a local store owner, enter a trick wall, and then follow the neon pig. The tasty cocktails were worth the effort we spent getting into the bar. Other than talking to my mom on Christmas Day, everything about this holiday was new for me. At times, it was a bit overwhelming. However, not knowing what each day would bring during a season that's usually steeped in tradition was also exciting. Whether I return to Ireland in December 2025 or set off to another country, I'm excited to make solo travel my new holiday tradition.

Enrique Tarrio, the former leader of the fascist Proud Boys organization, was convicted for seditious conspiracy for helping to orchestrate the attack on Congress during the certification of the 2020 presidential election and sentenced to 22 years in prison, the longest of any January 6 defendant. Tarrio made a request for a pardon through his lawyer Nayib Hassan, who wrote a letter to the Department of Justice which was posted to X Monday morning by his mother, Zuny Tarrio. In 2023, federal prosecutors described Tarrio as the main force behind bringing hundreds of Proud Boys to Washington in 2021 to protest the election results and march to the Capitol building. Several of the organization’s leaders were the first rioters to break into the Capitol, including one lieutenant, Dominic Pezzola. Trump has repeatedly promised to pardon rioters involved in the attacks, even hiring one for his transition team, but has also said that some rioters were “out of control” and may still face consequences. However, as the leader of the Proud Boys at the time, Tarrio is arguably the most extreme of the defendants, and pardoning him would show that Trump wants to reward the insurrectionists rather than make a token gesture to his supporters.",0,[],2025-01-06 23:04:35,2025-01-06 23:04:35

Video footage shows a drone striking the facility and causing a massive fireball. Russia's Ust-Luga port is used to support a murky and deceptive ""shadow fleet."" Ukrainian forces carried out an attack on a major commercial port in Russia over the weekend, using long-range drones to target and disrupt the operations of Moscow's sanctions-evading ""shadow fleet."" The Security Service of Ukraine, known as the SBU, carried out the attack Saturday on Ust-Luga, a port in northwest Russia near the city of St. Petersburg, a source in the agency confirmed to Business Insider on Monday. The SBU source said the drones flew over 550 miles and ""successfully hit"" their targets, with one drone striking containers filled with gas condensate, causing an explosion that severely damaged one container and sent shrapnel into three others nearby. Video footage obtained by BI appears to show the moment the drone hits the containers. Sporadic gunfire can be heard ringing out in the background, suggesting Russia attempted to shoot down the drone as it drew closer to its target. However, these efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, and the drone slammed into the Russian infrastructure, causing a massive fireball and a loud blast. The SBU source, citing unspecified experts, said repairing this facility will take a while and will cause a disruption to the port's operations. BI could not independently verify the SBU-provided details of the attack. Ust-Luga is Russia's largest commercial port in the Leningrad region and a key logistics hub along the Baltic Sea. The SBU source said Moscow uses the facility to sell oil and gas using its so-called ""shadow fleet."" The ""shadow fleet"" refers to the collection of vessels that Moscow uses to evade the international sanctions on its energy exports placed in response to its invasion of Ukraine and sustain significant cash flow to support its war efforts. According to the European Parliament, this murky, deceptive network consists of aging and poorly maintained vessels with unclear ownership and origins. The ships employ various tactics to conceal movements and operations, like transmitting false data, ship-to-ship transfers, automatic identification system blackouts, and other deceptive practices. ""As Russia depends increasingly on its 'shadow fleet' to maintain oil exports,"" the European Parliament wrote in a briefing published last year, ""the EU and allied nations have implemented measures to counter these evasive tactics."" It said the approaches include sanctions on specific vessels and greater international collaboration to disrupt the malign activity that helps to boost Russia's war chest. However, Ukraine appears to favor direct military action. ""Drone sanctions from the SBU reduce the currency that Russia needs to wage war,"" the security source said, according to a translation of their remarks shared with BI. The attack on Ust-Luga over the weekend marks the latest long-range Ukrainian strike on Russian soil. Kyiv has heavily relied on its arsenal of domestically produced drones for cross-border operations, using these explosive-packed uncrewed systems to target Moscow's energy and military facilities. In recent months, Ukrainian drones have struck Russian ammunition depots, airfields, and weapons storage facilities.

According to a new report by the Bezos-owned Washington Post, the Amazon exec’s solution to the company’s mass influx of orders and returns from Black Friday through January is to implement “Mandatory Extra Time” that forces some employees to work five eleven-hour shifts rather than their usual four ten-hour shifts. Despite a spokesperson for the company telling the Post that employees are paid overtime for additional hours, and explaining that workers can’t be asked to work more than 60 hours in one week, 12 hours in a one day, or six days in a row, the company’s peak season policies led to managers in one Amazon warehouses feeling the need to remind workers to practice basic personal hygiene. Amazon, employees reportedly claim, uses incentive pay, free drinks from 7-Eleven, raffles to win water bottles, and stress balls from roving “swag carts” to keep staff motivated amid strenuous demands. The raffle prizes, however, have seemingly declined in quality compared to previous years. “The stuff they was giving out wasn’t worth it,” one longtime employee told the Post. “It’s like, y’all done made a billion dollars, and this is all you can offer for a prize?” For Amazon delivery drivers, who work for contractors, not the online retailer itself, peak season entails longer hours and extra packages. This year, some drivers received $5 tips from customers who were prompted to thank their drivers via Amazon’s app, and coupons for free drinks from 7-Eleven each week to help them “stay warm and refreshed.” Meanwhile, over the holidays, Bezos and his fiancée, Lauren Sanchez, were spotted partying in Aspen with Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump, and Kevin Costner before jetting off to St. Barths, where customs officials conducted a surprise raid on his $500 million superyacht, Koru. Amazon spokesperson Steve Kelly told the Post that, during peak season, the company places “an extra emphasis on recognizing, honoring, and celebrating our employees for their commitment to safety, teamwork, and service to our customers,” and that employees are encouraged to share ideas for new appreciation programs with local managers. A Senate report in July, however, found that workplace injuries increase during Amazon’s busy seasons with the company seeing more than 10 annual injuries per 100 workers, double the industry average. These injuries, the report detailed, were part of Amazon’s “corporate culture obsessed with speed and productivity” which has “resulted in systemic safety failures and high rates of injury.” The report’s findings were echoed just before Christmas when an Amazon delivery driver in Massachusetts described being “stressed” after abandoning more than 80 packages in the woods. The exhausting environment within Amazon facilities led to workers at more than seven delivery stations and fulfillment centers in New York, California, Illinois, and Georgia walking off the job to demand higher pay, better working conditions, and for Amazon to bargain on a contract with workers who’ve voted to unionize with the help of the Teamsters. In 2023, the company generated more than $36.9 billion in profits, and Bezos himself is the second richest person in the world, with a net worth of approximately $238.6 billion, according to Forbes. All the while, Amazon opposes union organizing efforts, deploying tactics like delaying elections or having employees attend captive-audience meetings. The company Amazon is said to have recently spent over $17 million on union avoidance consultants, at times hiring them directly as managers.",16,[],2025-01-06 23:04:35,2025-01-06 23:04:35

Trump campaigned on aggressive tariffs despite many economists’ warning about subsequent price increases for American consumers. Now, sources familiar with the matter have told WaPo that they will only cover critical imports. Industries deemed vital to national and economic security will now be targeted instead of the original proposal of “universal tariffs” going ahead, the insiders said. WaPo reported that the change in tone “would jettison a key aspect of Trump’s campaign pledge,” but cited the insiders who said that nothing is set in stone yet. It is likely, however, that industries that Trump wants to return to the U.S. will be the main focus of the import duties. Tariffs on steel, iron, aluminum and copper, were earmarked by aides, the sources said. So too were critical medical supplies like syringes, needles, vials and pharmaceutical materials; and energy production implements like batteries, rare earth minerals and even solar panels, they added. Trump’s campaign promise would have seen the price of food imports and cheap consumer electronics skyrocket, but the latest reported tweaks mean producers in these fields may be able to breathe a sigh of relief. However, people familiar with the matter said slated tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China could be imposed along with the universal tariffs. “The sector-based universal tariff is a little bit easier for everybody to stomach out the gate. The thought is if you’re going to do universal tariffs, why not at least start with these targeted measures?” one of the people told WaPo. “And it would still give CEOs a massive incentive to start making their products here.” It comes after a host of billionaires enjoyed an audience with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in recent weeks. Among them was Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos, who reportedly jostled for the president-elect’s attention with his right hand man Elon Musk. Bezos has pledged to donate $1 million to the Trump inauguration through Amazon, while Musk, the SpaceX CEO and X owner, is believed to have poured at least $277 million into backing his main ally. Apple’s Tim Cook dined with Trump at the Florida resort a few weeks ago, and just last week announced that he too plans to donate $1 million. Among the others to bend the knee was OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, who pledged to personally donate $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund. “President Trump will lead our country into the age of AI, and I am eager to support his efforts to ensure America stays ahead,” Altman said in a statement. Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, also plans to send $1 million towards the kitty. The inaugural committee is projected to raise more than $150 million, according to reports. “There is an absolute deluge of interest,” a Republican fundraiser told ABC News. Even Bill Gates, who reportedly backed Kamala Harris to the tune of $50 million, is said to have courted Trump. Writing on Truth Social last month, Trump said the former CEO of Microsoft—whom Forbes says is the 16th richest in the world—personally asked for an audience with him. “In the first term, everyone was fighting me,” Trump said at Mar-a-Lago last month. “This time, everyone wants to be my friend.” Meanwhile, Trump addressed the Washington Post tariffs story on Truth Social, calling it “fake news.” He wrote on Monday morning: “The story in the Washington Post, quoting so-called anonymous sources, which don’t exist, incorrectly states that my tariff policy will be pared back. That is wrong. The Washington Post knows it’s wrong. It’s just another example of Fake News.”",10,[],2025-01-06 23:05:59,2025-01-06 23:05:59

The initiative, the first of its kind in the U.S., charges most drivers $9 during peak hours. It affects vehicles entering Manhattan south of 60th Street and covers areas that are typically clogged with traffic, including Times Square, the theater district, Hell's Kitchen, Chelsea and SoHo. New York City had the world's worst traffic in a 2023 scorecard from INRIX, a transportation data analytics firm, NPR reported. Other congested cities are following the results of the tolling program to determine its viability. Congestion pricing was an idea born in New York City, conceived by Columbia University professor William Vickrey in the 1950s, The New York Times reported. It has been used in London, Stockholm and Singapore, but didn't gain enough momentum in New York until the State Legislature approved it as part of the 2019 state budget, per The Times. The plan was to charge passenger vehicles $15 beginning last June. But Gov. Kathy Hochul canceled the start of the program, saying it could hurt the city's economy. Facing pressure from transit advocates, Hochul revived congestion pricing in November with the reduced fee of $9. Motorcyclists will pay less, while commercial truck drivers will pay up to $21.60. Discounts are offered overnight to all drivers. Transit officials expect the program will reduce the number of vehicles in the area by at least 13%, and that it will raise $15 billion to pay for repairs to subways and increase the number of electric buses, per The Times. Opponents of congestion pricing say they're not done fighting. The measure has survived several legal challenges but could still be upended by pending lawsuits from New Jersey, where officials have challenged environmental aspects of it, and from suburban counties surrounding New York City, where drivers have fewer mass transit options and say the toll is unfair. President-elect Donald Trump has said congestion pricing could hurt the city's tourism and business industries and pledged to end it after he takes office on Jan. 20.",1,[],2025-01-06 23:05:59,2025-01-06 23:05:59

CHP officials said phone scammers have been contacting parents posing as “Amber Alert representatives,” offering to register their children in a database in the event that the child goes missing or is taken. The scammers ask for confidential information and even ask to meet the parent at their home, officials said. But law enforcement officials are urging parents not to fall for those tactics, emphatically stating that this is now how the Amber Alert system works. In California, the CHP is the sole agency authorized to activate Amber Alerts, which do not require prior registration. There are no “Amber Alert representatives” and no exclusive database for children who have been “registered.” Authorities urge parents to remain vigilant and skeptical when receiving any calls from unknown numbers or calls that show up as “possible scam.” You should never provide personal information to those callers, CHP said, and if you’ve been contacted by a scammer, you should report it to local law enforcement immediately. “Stay informed and protect yourself,” CHP said. The Amber Alert system was founded in the 1990s in Texas in response to the kidnapping and killing of 9-year-old Amber Hagerman. Since then, all 50 states have established alert systems and the federal government has partnered with telecom and social media companies to help widely broadcast the emergency in hopes of preventing further tragedies. As of December 2024, more than 1,200 children were successfully recovered through the Amber Alert system and 195 children were rescued because of wireless emergency alerts, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.

But not only has eating out almost every night taken a toll on my wallet, but it’s also taken a toll on my waistline, which led me to do some research to find the best meal delivery services for weight loss and healthy eating. Frankly, I could care less about not fitting into my 2019 jeans, but I just feel off (sluggish, heavy, and less focused) as of late, and I am almost positive my current disposition is, at least in part, due to my less-than-stellar diet. This is precisely why I decided to look into some healthier (yet still convenient) meal delivery options this year. Yes, I would love to subscribe to those meal kit plans like Hello Fresh that supply you with new recipes and all of the ingredients necessary to make your meals, but I know having to dedicate even a half-hour every weeknight to cooking isn’t sustainable for my life (and work) schedule. Sure, ordering takeout or prepared meals from healthy restaurants is always a solid option, but if you’re like me and have realized that the majority of the money you’ve shelled out over the last year has gone directly to the pricey contactless restaurant and lazy-day fast food orders, you may also be looking to pull back a bit on relying on these delivery apps to feed you. Fortunately, there are plenty of affordable meal delivery services that are both healthy, affordable and, yes, actually tasty. Of course, it goes without saying that the meal delivery services listed below may not be quite as budget-friendly as shopping for your own groceries and preparing the food in your own kitchen, but they’re ridiculously convenient nonetheless.

During an appearance on The Howard Stern Show Monday morning, Glaser told Stern the version of the joke she opted out of using: “The Golden Globes is the only show where you can see the biggest stars and movies and television joined together with the same goal—getting out of here tonight before Dax Shepard asked them to do his podcast. This is the last time all of you will be in the same room together until the Diddy trial.” Glaser explained why she chose the milder version of the joke by saying, “That one you don’t want to do, because it’s like you’re accusing the people of that room of being involved in that, and they might turn on you.” Glaser drew rave reviews for her hosting gig, with critics pretty much unanimous that she “boosted” the awards show broadcast. As promised, Glaser treaded more lightly than some roast fans might have expected with most of her material, though she did manage to squeeze in a Diddy joke in in some way, quipping that Challengers was “more sexually charged than Diddy’s credit card.” She also shared that she was “upset” that “the after-party is not going to be as good this year” in Diddy’s absence. Diddy is currently being held without bail as he awaits trial for federal sex trafficking and racketeering charges and fights several lawsuits from alleged victims who say he drugged, raped, trafficked, and otherwise abused them—some during his alleged “freak-offs.” Glaser commented her faux disappointment Sunday night at the disgraced mogul’s incarceration since “a Stanley Tucci freak-off just doesn’t have the same ring to it.” There were other potential Diddy mentions, Glaser told Stern. Another that didn’t make it to air, she said, “Amy Adams is nominated for her performance in Night B----, while I was totally snubbed for my performance in Day Slut. The documentary category is tough, though, by the way, ‘Night, b----’ is what Diddy hears every evening before it lights out.” Other jabs Glaser saved in her “Stern file,” to reveal on the show poked fun at Nicole Kidman as a “Wild Robot” after “two wines” and Ben Affleck for “ruining” women named “Jennifer” amid speculation about his relationships with ex-wives Lopez and Garner. Glaser also admitted to flubbing the Affleck joke that did make it into her set. “Wicked, Queer, Nightb----. These are not just words Ben Affleck yells after he orgasms. These are some of the incredible movies nominated tonight,” the comedian said in the live broadcast. But as she told Stern, “It was supposed to be ‘when he orgasms’ and I said ‘after’ and it really bugged me. It still works. It’s just less clear. It’s two percent more funny [the other way].” Matt Gaetz’s alleged sex scandal nearly made it to the Globes too, as Glaser originally planned to joke that the film Anora has “been called the most unflinching look at sex work since Matt Gaetz’s payment history.” Though all of the left out material was brutal, there was only one Glaser admitted was “not nice,” as she nearly called out Alec Baldwin in a quip about the death of Rust cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. “Please know that I know this is not nice,” she prefaced on the show Monday, “Michael Keaton was so great in Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice and Alec Baldwin, sadly, did not come back to play a ghost because he was too busy making them.” Glaser left that one out because it was “too mean” and she didn’t want to “re-traumatize” Baldwin.

Johnson, who portrays Luke Hobbs, joined the high-speed franchise in the fifth installment, released in 2011.

Widely regarded as one of the best installments in the franchise, Johnson played an agent for an elite force known as the Diplomatic Security Service. After the deaths of three DEA agents at the start of ""Fast Five,"" Hobbs was hired to bring in Dominic Toretto (Diesel) and Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker). For most of the movie, Hobbs spent time tracking down Dom and his associates. At one point, Dom and Johnson's character fought one-on-one. But after Hobbs' team was eliminated, he made a truce with Dom's crew and sided with them. To avenge his fallen team, Hobbs shot Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) dead and further defied the law by allowing Dom's team to steal Reyes' vault loaded with millions. May 24, 2013: Dom and Hobbs join forces to take down the main antagonist of ""Fast & Furious 6."" Hobbs recruited Dom and his crew to help put an end to Owen Shaw's (Luke Evans) globe-trotting, destructive heists. At the end of the film, after succeeding, Hobbs told Dom, ""Til next time"" before departing. April 3, 2015: In ""Furious 7,"" Dom and Hobbs find a new enemy in Deckard Shaw, the big brother of Owen Shaw. Once again, Hobbs turned to Dom and his team to do whatever was required to take down a villain, played by Jason Statham. By the end of the movie, Hobbs captured Deckard and escorted him to a heavily guarded solitary cell made of concrete and steel. August 8, 2016: During his final week on the set of the eighth movie, Johnson publicly calls out his male costars for being unprofessional. In his since-deleted posts on Facebook and Instagram, Johnson applauded the movie's ""incredible hard working crew"" and the partners at Universal Studios. But he had some choice words for other people involved. ""My female co-stars are always amazing and I love 'em. My male co-stars however are a different story,"" he wrote. ""Some conduct themselves as stand up men and true professionals, while others don't. The ones that don't are too chicken shit to do anything about it anyway. Candy asses."" He continued: ""When you watch this movie next April and it seems like I'm not acting in some of these scenes and my blood is legit boiling — you're right. Bottom line is it'll play great for the movie and fits this Hobbs character that's embedded in my DNA extremely well."" November 19, 2016: Johnson says that he had no regrets about his post. ""I was very clear with what I said. I've been in the game a long time,"" Johnson told the LA Times. ""Would Universal have preferred that didn't happen? Sure, we talked about it. The irony is after that and as they do their tracking and all their analysis, the interest shot through the roof to a whole other level."" April 7, 2017: Ahead of the release of ""The Fate of the Furious,"" Diesel tells USA Today that he and Johnson's tension was ""blown out of proportion."" ""I don't think the world really realizes how close we are, in a weird way,"" Diesel said. ""I think some things may be blown out of proportion. I don't think that was his intention. I know he appreciates how much I work this franchise. In my house, he's Uncle Dwayne."" ""I protect the franchise,"" added the actor, who also serves as producer for the franchise. ""I protect everybody including Dwayne. I protected Dwayne more than he'll ever know. And it doesn't matter. He doesn't have to know. But he appreciates it. He knows it."" ""Dwayne has only got one Vin in his life,"" Diesel continued. ""Dwayne Johnson only has one big brother in this film world and that's me."" April 14, 2017: ""The Fate of the Furious"" hits theaters. Hobbs called on Dom and his associates to intervene when a new threat presented itself. During their mission, Dom went rogue and helped the antagonist, Cipher (Charlize Theron). That led to tension between Diesel and Johnson's characters. But in true ""Fast"" tradition, Dom's crew celebrated another win with a family BBQ at the end of the movie. Hobbs' record was cleared and he was offered his old job back, but he declined so he could take a break and spend time with his daughter. April 21, 2017: A week after the eighth movie's release, Deadline reports that a spin-off centered on Johnson and Statham's characters is in the works. At the time, Deadline reported that the movie was in the early stages and details were sparse. September 2017: Franchise star Tyrese Gibson inserts himself into the drama and discourages Johnson from pursuing his spin-off. ""If you move forward with that Hobbs movie you will have purposely ignored the heart to heart moment we had in my sprinter,"" he wrote in a since-deleted Instagram post. ""I don't wanna hear from you until you remember what we talked about."" In a follow-up post that was also erased, Gibson, who plays Roman Pierce, said he was unable to reach Johnson. ""He won't call me back about this solo #HobbsMovie,"" Gibson said. ""I want you to shoot it just not right now cause the #Fast9 Date has already been announced and we can't let our loyal fans down on any level."" October 4, 2017: Gibson blames Johnson for delaying the ninth ""Fast & Furious"" movie. The movie was pushed back a year and Gibson pinned the delay on Johnson and his spin-off,  ""Hobbs & Shaw."" In his Instagram post, Gibson congratulated Johnson and Hiram Garcia, one of Johnson's producing partners, for ""making the fast and the furious franchise about YOU."" ""Gn folks see you in 2020 April #FastFamily right? Nah..... it's about #TeamDewayne #3yrs will it be worth the wait?"" he added.      October 6, 2017: Diesel takes to Instagram to urge fans not to blame the delay on anyone in particular. Diesel posted a photo of him and Johnson in character and wrote, ""I know there has been a lot of speculation as to why the Fast 9 release date was pushed... but it would be unfair to say it is anyone's fault."" ""As we plot the course to expand the Fast & Furious universe, one must be mindful to take stock of the roads we took to get here,"" he continued. ""The pillars of authenticity, family and most importantly, our loyal fan's perspective has been instrumental in procuring success.However, like any vehicle that has run around the globe 8 times, the franchise is in need of maintenance."" April 4, 2018: Johnson addresses his feud with Diesel in a candid interview with Rolling Stone. Johnson confirmed to Rolling Stone that he and Diesel's scenes for ""The Fate of the Furious"" were filmed separately. ""We were not in any scenes together,"" he said. Johnson said that he and Diesel disagreed about their approaches to their work. ""Vin and I had a few discussions, including an important face-to-face in my trailer,"" he said. ""And what I came to realize is that we have a fundamental difference in philosophies on how we approach moviemaking and collaborating. It took me some time, but I'm grateful for that clarity. Whether we work together again or not."" Johnson also cast doubt on whether he'd return for the ninth ""Fast & Furious"" movie. He said that he was ""concentrating"" on his spin-off with Jason Statham. ""But I wish him all the best, and I harbor no ill will there, just because of the clarity we have,"" Johnson said of Diesel. ""Actually, you can erase that last part about 'no ill will.' We'll just keep it with the clarity."" August 2, 2019: ""Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw"" is released in theaters. The titular characters formed a reluctant, unlikely alliance in order to save Deckard's sister Hattie (Vanessa Kirby) and stop a modified antagonist named Brixton Lore (Idris Elba). June 22, 2021: In a cover story for Men's Health, Diesel says that he gave Johnson ""tough love"" to elicit the performance he wanted from the wrestler-turned-movie-star. ""It was a tough character to embody, the Hobbs character,"" Diesel told the Men's Health. ""My approach at the time was a lot of tough love to assist in getting that performance where it needed to be. As a producer to say, OK, we're going to take Dwayne Johnson, who's associated with wrestling, and we're going to force this cinematic world, audience members, to regard his character as someone that they don't know — Hobbs hits you like a ton of bricks."" ""That's something that I'm proud of, that aesthetic,"" Diesel added. ""That took a lot of work. We had to get there and sometimes, at that time, I could give a lot of tough love. Not Felliniesque, but I would do anything I'd have to do in order to get performances in anything I'm producing."" June 25, 2021: ""F9"" is released, and Johnson is noticeably absent from the ensemble movie. Even though Hobbs didn't appear in the film, Johnson was busy promoting other films that year. He starred alongside Emily Blunt in "" Jungle Cruise,"" had a cameo in ""Free Guy,"" and starred in the action film ""Red Notice."" July 21, 2021: Johnson tells The Hollywood Reporter that he ""laughed hard"" at Diesel's ""tough love"" remarks. ""I laughed and I laughed hard,"" Johnson told The Hollywood Reporter. ""I think everyone had a laugh at that. And I'll leave it at that. And that I've wished them well. I wish them well on 'Fast 9.' And I wish them the best of luck on 'Fast 10' and 'Fast 11' and the rest of the 'Fast & Furious' movies they do that will be without me."" October 12, 2021: Johnson tells Vanity Fair that he regretted making his feud with Diesel public, but meant what he said. ""I shouldn't have shared that,"" Johnson said in his November 2021 cover story for Vanity Fair. ""Because at the end of the day, that goes against my DNA. I don't share things like that. And I take care of that kind of bullshit away from the public. They don't need to know that."" ""Nothing specific happened, just the same old shit,"" he said about why he spoke publicly. ""And that just wasn't my best day."" Still, the ""Jungle Cruise"" star wouldn't take back his words. ""I meant what I said. For sure,"" Johnson said. ""I mean what I say when I say it. But to express it publicly was not the right thing to do."" The actor also said that he agreed to be in ""The Fate of the Furious"" as long as he and Diesel didn't share any scenes together because he ""wanted to forgo drama. ""I thought that that was the best thing to do. For everybody,"" he said. November 7, 2021: Diesel implores ""little brother"" Johnson to return for the 10th ""Fast & Furious"" film and ""not leave the franchise idle."" ""My little brother Dwayne... the time has come,"" Diesel wrote in an Instagram post. ""The world awaits the finale of Fast 10. As you know, my children refer to you as Uncle Dwayne in my house. There is not a holiday that goes by that they and you don't send well wishes... but the time has come. Legacy awaits."" ""I told you years ago that I was going to fulfill my promise to Pablo,"" Diesel continued, referring to late costar Paul Walker. ""I swore that we would reach and manifest the best Fast in the finale that is 10!"" ""I say this out of love... but you must show up, do not leave the franchise idle you have a very important role to play,"" he said. ""Hobbs can't be played by no other. I hope that you rise to the occasion and fulfill your destiny."" December 30, 2021: Johnson tells CNN that he was surprised by Diesel's public plea. ""This past June, when Vin and I actually connected not over social media, I told him directly — and privately — that I would not be returning to the franchise,"" he told CNN. ""I was firm yet cordial with my words and said that I would always be supportive of the cast and always root for the franchise to be successful, but that there was no chance I would return. I privately spoke with my partners at Universal as well, all of whom were very supportive as they understand the problem."" Johnson then accused Diesel of ""manipulation."" ""Vin's recent public post was an example of his manipulation,"" the actor said. ""I didn't like that he brought up his children in the post, as well as Paul Walker's death. Leave them out of it. We had spoken months ago about this and came to a clear understanding."" Johnson continued: ""My goal all along was to end my amazing journey with this incredible 'Fast & Furious' franchise with gratitude and grace. It's unfortunate that this public dialogue has muddied the waters."" ""Regardless, I'm confident in the 'Fast' universe and its ability to consistently deliver for the audience, and I truly wish my former co-stars and crew members the best of luck and success in the next chapter,"" he concluded. May 19, 2023: In a shock to the fandom, Johnson reprises his role for the end-credits scene of ""Fast X."" Jason Momoa joined the franchise as Dante, the son of ""Fast Five"" antagonist Hernan Reyes and the villain seeking revenge in ""Fast X."" In the ""Fast X"" end-credits scene, over the phone, Dante warned Johnson that he'd face consequences for killing his father. ""You took the most important thing in my life from me,"" Dante said. ""Dom drove the car, but you? You pulled the trigger and now I'm gonna make you suffer."" ""Fast X"" director Louis Leterrier told The Hollywood Reporter that it was a team effort to get Johnson on board. ""I didn't know Dwayne, personally, but we reached out to Dwayne and Dwayne's team,"" he explained. ""We sort of looked at each other from across the room and winked a few months back, saying, 'We should work together.' And then I had this idea and I presented it to the producers and the studio."" He continued: ""And then we reached out to Dwayne and his team and said, 'Just come and watch the movie. You have to love the movie first.' So he came to see the movie and really loved it, and then we started talking."" Diesel also told THR in a separate interview that conversations regarding Johnson and Gal Gadot's return as Gisele ""have been going on for a while."" ""The conversations are what makes the best movie? What feels right for a franchise? How do you make as many people happy in this world? And both of them clearly make people happy,"" Diesel said. June 1, 2023: Another ""Fast"" installment is announced, centered on Johnson's return as Hobbs. The movie is intended to be a bridge between ""Fast X"" and the upcoming second part. Johnson reacted to the news by sharing a message on X (formerly known as Twitter). In his post, the actor said that he and Diesel put their history behind them and will ""lead with brotherhood and resolve."" ""The next Fast & Furious film you'll see the legendary lawman in will be the HOBBS movie that will serve as a fresh, new chapter & set up for FASTX: Part II,"" Johnson wrote. ""Last summer Vin and I put all the past behind us. We'll lead with brotherhood and resolve - and always take care of the franchise, characters & FANS that we love. I've built my career on an  'Audience First' mentality and that will always serve as my North Star."" January 5, 2025: Diesel and Johnson have an awkward interaction at the Golden Globes. Diesel and Johnson both attended the show to present different awards. Before Diesel presented the cinematic and box office achievement award to ""Wicked,"" he looked over at Johnson in the crowd and said, ""Hey, Dwayne."" As the crowd laughed, Johnson awkwardly smiled back. Read the original article on Business Insider",0,[],2025-01-06 23:36:18,2025-01-06 23:36:18

https://www.yahoo.com/news/tiktok-ban-debate-reaches-the-supreme-court-this-week-heres-what-to-expect--and-what-could-happen-next-215222200.html,TikTok ban debate reaches the Supreme Court this week. Here’s what to expect — and what could happen next.,,Politics,Yahoo News,5 min read,The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments on Friday challenging a law that seeks to ban TikTok in the U.S. on Jan. 19.,Katie MatherReporter,2025-01-06T21:52:22.000Z,"The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments this week in a case challenging a law that seeks to ban the popular app TikTok in the United States if it is not sold by its owner, Byte Dance, which is based in China. The law, which was signed by President Biden in April 2024 and upheld by a Washington, D.C., federal court in December, is set to go into effect on Jan. 19. TikTok has argued that the law is a violation of First Amendment rights. The federal government has claimed in its responses that the fact that ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, is owned by China is a potential threat to national security. However, ByteDance has said since April that it has no plans to sell TikTok to an American company, as required by the law. Donald Trump, who will be inaugurated for his second term in the White House one day after the ban goes into effect, has taken varying positions on TikTok. When he was president in August 2020, he threatened to ban the app if ByteDance didn’t sell it, but multiple federal judges blocked his attempts at the time. However, while running for reelection in 2024, he launched his own TikTok account and told followers he would “save TikTok in America” if he won the election. As recently as Jan. 3, Trump asked, “Why would I want to get rid of TikTok?” However, he may not ultimately have a say in the matter, especially if the Supreme Court chooses not to block the ban from taking effect. Ahead of the oral arguments scheduled for Friday, here’s what you need to know about what could happen next for TikTok. In December, the Supreme Court declined to grant a request by TikTok and ByteDance for an emergency injunction to block the ban, choosing instead to first hear oral arguments. On Thursday, lawyers for both sides will have the opportunity to make their case to the justices for and against banning TikTok. In their filing to the Supreme Court, TikTok and ByteDance argued, ""If Americans, duly informed of the alleged risks of 'covert' content manipulation, choose to continue viewing content on TikTok with their eyes wide open, the First Amendment entrusts them with making that choice, free from the government's censorship."" On Dec. 27, Trump filed a legal brief asking the Supreme Court to delay their decision on the TikTok ban until after he is officially in office on Jan. 20. The filing argues that the Supreme Court should allow Trump and his incoming administration to look into the political questions involved in the case, especially whether the ban is a violation of Americans’ First Amendment rights. The filing also argues that Trump could find an alternative solution to the national security concerns associated with ByteDance. As of reporting, the Supreme Court has not publicly responded to Trump’s filing. However, the Department of Justice has publicly asked the justices to reject it, saying the filing took “no position” on the First Amendment debate, which is the foundation of TikTok and ByteDance’s argument. If the Supreme Court allows the ban to take effect on Jan. 19, is there anything Trump can do to reverse that decision once he is inaugurated on Jan. 20? The law does include a provision that allows the president to pause the TikTok ban for 90 days if ByteDance proves it is in the process of selling the app, Forbes reported. Trump could try to pause the ban himself for the first 90 days of his administration, but without evidence that ByteDance is actively working to divest from TikTok, his decision could be challenged in court. Another option would be for Trump to ask his Justice Department and attorney general not to enforce the ban, Alan Z. Rozenshtein, an associate law professor at the University of Minnesota Law School wrote at Lawfare Media. However, in that case, most companies and individual users would probably be discouraged from using the app, since doing so would still technically be considered to be breaking the law. If you do not have TikTok on your phone by Jan. 19, you will not be able to download it once the ban takes effect. On Dec. 13, the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the U.S. and the Chinese Community Party wrote letters to Apple and Google — which own the two main mobile app stores — reiterating that they must remove TikTok from their stores when the ban takes effect. If you are one of the 170 million current U.S.-based TikTok users, the Department of Justice has stated that the ban will “not directly prohibit the continued use of TikTok” and won’t immediately eliminate the app from individuals’ phones. Instead, over time, without updates or technical help from TikTok, the app will slowly become “unworkable.” India had about 200 million TikTok users before it banned the platform and dozens of other Chinese-owned apps four years ago, following a military clash along the India-China border. In response to the ban, India’s former TikTok users instead migrated to platforms like Google’s YouTube Shorts and Instagram’s Reels. The only way to avoid a full ban on TikTok in the U.S. is if ByteDance either sells the app or at least proves it’s trying to divest from the app. Multiple American companies and entrepreneurs have offered to buy TikTok from ByteDance, including, most prominently, former Los Angeles Dodgers owner and Project Liberty founder Frank McCourt. Companies like Oracle, Walmart and Microsoft expressed interest in buying TikTok back in 2020. However, ByteDance has made it clear since April that it has no intention of selling TikTok, despite the U.S. ban.",4,[],2025-01-06 23:48:10,2025-01-07 00:39:27

It’s since been reported that she’s engaged to long-time love Tom Holland. True to their efforts in keeping their love life private, they haven’t officially announced their engagement, but both TMZ and People confirmed the news through sources close to the pair. TMZ said it happened at one of her homes over the holidays and it was an intimate moment between just the two of them. The pair, both 28, are a match made in Hollywood — more specifically, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Zendaya was cast as “MJ,” the love interest of Holland’s Peter Parker/Spider-Man, in 2017’s Spider-Man: Homecoming. Real-life romance rumors swirled around the pair almost immediately. Their relationship wasn’t confirmed until four years later when they were photographed kissing in a car, and since then they’ve shared aspects of their love story. She popped up in the British actor’s Instagram for the first time. Fans quickly anointed them with a couple nickname: “Tomdaya.” It was lost on nobody that past Spider-Man co-stars Kirsten Dunst and Tobey Maguire as well as Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone found love on the set — at least for a while. The connection between the Billy Elliot actor and Disney Channel alum was apparent while they promoted the film around the globe. In July, People and Us Weekly reported that they were secretly dating. A source told People, “They’ve been super careful to keep it private and out of the public eye but they’ve gone on vacations with each other and try and spend as much time as possible with one another.” They laughed it off on social media, but the rumors persisted. Wait wait...my favorite is when it says we go on vacations together HA! I haven't been on a vacation in years!😂😭🤣hbu @TomHolland1996 ??? https://t.co/zSkvcfzzTa — Zendaya (@Zendaya) July 13, 2017 @Zendaya Does the press tour count 😂😝 https://t.co/2WsstZPyde — Tom Holland (@TomHolland1996) July 13, 2017 In August, the Euphoria actress denied they were dating, but called Holland “one of my best friends.” Four months later, they were spotted at a restaurant with her parents. They worked on their second Spidey film — and showed one another a lot of love on social media, including his praise of her Met Gala look, but fans were left wondering: Are they or aren’t they? Their characters locked lips for the first time in Spider-Man: Far From Home. While promoting the film, they made headlines when Holland accidentally tagged Zendaya over his male anatomy in a photo and she had a funny response. At some point, whatever was going on between them fizzled. Soon after, he was linked to Olivia Bolton and she spent time with Jacob Elordi. During COVID, they reunited in Atlanta to work on the film. Fans erupted when they were spotted making out in a car in July with a paparazzo capturing the intimate moment. Holland posted a birthday tribute to “My MJ” — and she had a flirty reply. Holland discussed his discomfort over the paparazzi kiss pix, telling GQ, “I’ve always been really adamant to keep my private life private, because I share so much of my life with the world anyway. We sort of felt robbed of our privacy” Zendaya added to the outlet, “It was quite strange and weird and confusing and invasive. The equal sentiment [we both share] is just that when you really love and care about somebody, some moments or things, you wish were your own. I think loving someone is a sacred thing and a special thing and something that you want to deal with and go through and experience and enjoy amongst the two people that love each other.” Spider-Man: No Way Home hit the big screen. No longer ""in hiding,"" the pair briefly held hands at a London photocall. Holland described Zendaya as “beautiful” in an interview with the Associated Press and talked about their deep connection, saying, “The biggest way is just companionship, you know, like two friends coming together, experiencing this world, going through the same problems at the same times, having a shoulder to cry on, has been a huge thing for the pair of us.” Zendaya posted her own birthday tribute to “My Spider-Man.” They continued to let their guard down a bit in front of photographers. Zendaya not only accompanied Holland to the premiere of his film Unchartered, but they openly held hands. When Zendaya won the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for Euphoria, she told E! News that the first person she texted was her “boyfriend.” They went on public dates, including one at a New York Rangers hockey game. Before she got her engagement bling, Zendaya debuted a ring with Holland’s initials. She told Elle that year that she was done hiding the relationship, saying, “Parts of my life, I accept, are going to be public. I can’t not be a person and live my life and love the person I love. But also, I do have control over what I choose to share. It’s about protecting the peace and letting things be your own but also not being afraid to exist. You can’t hide. That’s not fun, either. I am navigating it more than ever now.” Holland told the Hollywood Reporter that he was still apprehensive about letting the world in, saying, “Our relationship is something that we are incredibly protective of and we want to keep as sacred as possible. We don’t think that we owe it to anyone, it’s our thing, and it has nothing to do with our careers.” Holland told BuzzFeed that he had no need for charisma because his girlfriend had it in spades. “I’m happy and in love,” he said. “I have no rizz whatsoever. I have limited rizz.” Zendaya laughed off engagement rumors sparked by a ring she was wearing in an Instagram video. At the start of the year, Holland told TMZ the rumors that he and Zendaya split were ""absolutely not” true. While promoting Dune, Zendaya was asked by Buzzfeed which of her co-stars has the most rizz — and she took the opportunity give a shout out to her boyfriend: “I think someone who has beautiful charisma, not on the Dune cast, but personally works for me, is Mr. Tom Holland. … He’s got that natural gift.” Zendaya told Vanity Fair that working with her boyfriend was never awkward. “It’s actually strangely comfortable,” she said. “It’s like second nature, if anything. You feel extra safe with the person you’re acting beside. I love working with him. He’s so talented, and so passionate about what he does. He always gives things one thousand percent, even if he’s absolutely worn down. I really appreciate that about him. It feels pretty normal. That’s how we met. Literally, at a chemistry read.” At the end of the year, Holland said on The Dish podcast that he was excited to spend the holidays with “my girlfriend’s family.” We now know it was over the holidays that he popped the question. The Challengers actress showed up at the Jan. 5 awards show without Holland but with a sparkling diamond. She didn’t comment on her new hardware — even when a Los Angeles Times reporter asked her outright: “Are you engaged?” According to the outlet, she kept showing her ring, smiling and “shrugged her shoulders mysteriously.” Yahoo Entertainment’s Taryn Ryder observed that Zendaya made no effort to hide what was on her left hand and showed it off to The Bear actress Ayo Edebiri. Fans also noticed a “T” tattoo on her ribs. One day later, TMZ and People reported that she’s engaged to Holland, who had popped the question over the holidays at Zendaya’s home. People reported that the ring appears to be a Jessica McCormack diamond.",0,[],2025-01-06 23:48:10,2025-01-06 23:48:10

A LIFE-THREATENING, DESTRUCTIVE, Widespread Windstorm is expected Tue afternoon-Weds morning across much of Ventura/LA Co. Areas not typically windy will be impacted,"" the National Weather Service in Los Angeles said in a message posted to social media on Monday. The areas ""of greatest concern"" include the San Gabriel, Santa Susana and Santa Monica Mountains and foothills, as well as the San Fernando Valley, Pasadena, Burbank, Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Simi Valley, Sylmar, Porter Ranch, Altadena, La Crescenta and Malibu, the National Weather Service said. Wind gusts between 50-80 miles per hour are expected across the region, with gusts of up to 100 mph possible for some mountainous regions that haven’t seen significant rainfall in months. “A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions are either occurring now, or will shortly. Use extreme caution with anything that can spark a wildfire,” the National Weather Service said. “Residents near wildland interfaces should be prepared to evacuate if a wildfire breaks out.” High wind watches have also been posted in the mountains of Riverside and San Diego counties, which will have an elevated risk of wildfire. For residents of Southern California, Santa Ana winds are nothing new. “Santa Ana winds are dry and warm (often hot) winds in the Southern California area that blow in from the desert — which includes the Great Basin of the western United States, incorporating Nevada and part of Utah,” Robert Fovell, a professor of atmospheric and oceanic sciences at UCLA, said in an FAQ posted to the university’s website. The winds can blow any time when the Great Basin becomes cooler than Southern California. Most typically, that occurs between September and May. “The Great Basin resides at a higher elevation than the L.A. Basin, which is near sea level. The air flowing into Southern California, forming the Santa Ana winds, is subsiding. When air descends, it is compressed, and its temperature rises,” Fovell explained. Author Joan Didion introduced many Americans to the famous winds in her 1969 essay “The Santa Anas.” “It is hard for people who have not lived in Los Angeles to realize how radically the Santa Ana figures in the local imagination. The city burning is Los Angeles's deepest image of itself,” she wrote. The warnings come as much of the southern half of the state has had a drier than normal weather pattern. The affected areas are currently experiencing moderate drought conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, and Ventura, Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties are abnormally dry or worse. But that hasn’t been the case for the entire state. “Portions of San Diego County have seen their driest start to the season (and 9-month period overall) in over 150 years; the contrast between (anomalously wet) NorCal and (record dry) SoCal is even more anomalous than either the northern wet or southern dry anomalies on their own,” UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain wrote on his blog, Weather West. “It is truly a matter of the precipitation 'haves' and 'have nots' at the moment—and there is no real prospect for this to change in the short term; even in the long term, it remains possible this overall dipole persists for the rest of the season (though hopefully with less extreme intensity).” With such dry conditions in place in the southern half of the state in combination with strong Santa Ana winds, residents of Southern California are bracing for the worst. “Here we go again. Another wind event. … So, fire concerns are going to be the main story for us,” KTLA meteorologist Henry DiCarlo said Monday.",13,[],2025-01-06 23:48:10,2025-01-06 23:48:10

She seemingly debuted the diamond at Sunday's Golden Globe awards.,Taryn RyderReporter,2025-01-06T17:55:57.000Z,"It was the question on everyone's mind at Sunday's Golden Globes: Are Zendaya and Tom Holland engaged? According to reports, the answer is yes. The 28-year-old actress sparked engagement speculation when she wore a diamond ring on that finger. Inside the ballroom at the Beverly Hilton, the Challengers star made no effort to hide what was on her left hand. She was pictured seemingly showing friends, like The Bear star Ayo Edebiri, her new hardware. According to TMZ, which was first to report Holland and Zendaya's engagement, the actor proposed over the holidays at one of her homes ""in a very intimate setting."" The Spider-Man co-stars have been together since at least 2021. People magazine later confirmed the two were engaged. Zendaya was decked out in Bulgari jewelry at the Globes, according to a press release, but there was no credit for the sparkler on her left hand. People magazine reported that the ring appears to be a Jessica McCormack diamond that is listed in the engagement rings section of the company website. If Zendaya's ring is the one speculated about online, it's 5.02 carats and is a Georgian-style cut in 18k white-and-yellow gold. The brand posted about actress-filmmaker Zoë Kravitz wearing its jewelry to the Golden Globes, but there was no mention of Zendaya's hardware. Yahoo Entertainment contacted the designer but did not immediately receive a response. A rep for the actress did not comment. Los Angeles Times reporter Amy Kaufman, herself recently engaged, had an interesting interaction with the Dune star at the Globes when it came to the supposed engagement ring. “As Zendaya exited the ballroom, a recently engaged Times reporter held up her left ring finger and pointed at it,” Kaufman wrote on Sunday. “The actor responded by flashing her own bling on her left hand, doing a sort of jazz-fingers motion.” ""Are you engaged?” the Los Angeles Times asked. According to the report, Zendaya ""smiled coyly and shrugged her shoulders mysteriously."" Zendaya and Holland have starred in three Spider-Man films together. However, they do not walk red carpet events with each other if they are not related to those movies, hence his absence on Sunday night. ""It’s not my moment, it's her moment, and if we go together, it’s about us,"" Holland recently told Men's Health. Neither Holland nor Zendaya has made a public statement about their relationship status. A rep for Holland did not respond to Yahoo's request for comment.",401,[],2025-01-06 23:48:10,2025-01-07 01:19:40

Officials in Jackson County, Mo., said a 61-year-old man died on Sunday when he was struck by a sliding dump truck. In Wichita, Kan., a 24-year-old man and 26-year-old woman were killed in a rollover crash, when the vehicle they were traveling in spun out on the interstate and flew down an embankment, police said. States of emergency were declared in seven states and the District of Columbia, where 16 inches of snow was forecast. Up to 18 inches of snow fell in Kansas, forcing the closure of I-70. More than 5 feet of snow was reported in western New York. More than 1,900 flights in and out of the U.S. were canceled on Monday, and more than 5,000 were delayed. Hundreds of thousands of utility customers were without power. The storm’s arrival comes as an Arctic air mass is expected to send temperatures plunging as far south as the Gulf Coast. Forecasters say those frigid temperatures will likely remain through mid-January. Hundreds of schools across the middle of the country will remain closed on Tuesday as crews continue to clear roadways amid plummeting temperatures. The Alton Telegraph in Alton, Ill., reported that several districts in Central Illinois would keep their doors closed Tuesday. Schools will also remain closed in the Kansas City metro area, KMBC News reported. The same will be true for schools in the Cincinnati, Ohio, area, WLWT5 News reported. Schools and some businesses in and around Roanoke, Va. will also remain closed on Tuesday, WFXR reported, as will they in Cumberland County, Tenn., according to 3BMediaNews.com.

Ronald Reagan National Airport announced this evening that it would be temporarily closing down its runways to allow for a crew to clear out snow and ""prevent refreezing on the airfield."" Reagan National Airport (DCA) is outside Washington, D.C. Although the announcement, posted to X, did not include specific times, FlightAware said all inbound flights into DCA were held until 8 p.m. ET. Earlier today, it was reported that ""almost all flights"" out of DCA had been canceled as the airport itself had almost 5 inches of snow by 9 a.m. ET. Bao Li and Qing Bao, the two new giant pandas at the Smithsonian's National Zoo in Washington, D.C., were spotted playing around in the snow earlier today. The pair were both born in China in 2021 and moved to D.C. in October. They will make their public debut on Jan. 24. While portions of the Midwest and the mid-Atlantic region grapple with heavy snow, Southern California is bracing for a different weather threat. The National Weather Service has issued a red flag warning for Los Angeles and parts of Ventura County through Thursday evening, meaning that conditions for wildfires will be at their highest, thanks to low humidity, an ongoing drought and the arrival of strong Santa Ana winds. ""HEADS UP!!! A LIFE-THREATENING, DESTRUCTIVE, Widespread Windstorm is expected Tue afternoon-Weds morning across much of Ventura/LA Co. Areas not typically windy will be impacted,"" the National Weather Service in Los Angeles said in a message posted to social media on Monday. Read more from Yahoo News. On Monday the governors of seven states — Maryland, Arkansas, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Virginia and West Virginia — declared a state of emergency in response to the winter storm that had paralyzed much of the midsection of the country, Sky News reported. More than 60 million people have found themselves under winter weather alerts issued by the National Weather Service since Saturday. The city of Richmond, Va., and the Virginia Department of Health issued a Boil Water Advisory Monday after the massive winter storm knocked out power to the city's water reservoir system. ""Our top priority is the health and safety of our residents and neighbors. I am asking all Richmonders to limit their water usage as the team at the Department of Public Utilities works around the clock to get our water system back online,” Mayor Danny Avula said in a statement posted to the city's website. “I’m also asking residents to consider their neighbors and only use as much water as they need – we’re all in this together, and our team is vigorously working to restore full function to our water system in the near term.” City officials provided a checklist to ensure the consumption of ""safe drinking water during this time"" that included the following: Do not drink tap water during this boil water alert. Do not drink from water fountains in parks, public or private buildings that receive water from the City of Richmond Department of Public Utilities. Do not use ice made from water today. Discard the ice and sanitize the ice machine and/or ice trays. Likewise, do not use water dispensed directly from a refrigerator. Do not use tap water to make drinks, juices, or fountain soft drinks. Do not wash your dishes using tap water — use boiled water or use paper plates for the next few days. Do not wash your fruits and vegetables with tap water — use boiled or bottled water. Do not brush your teeth with tap water — use boiled or bottled water. Do not cook with tap water, unless your food will be boiled vigorously for three minutes. The National Weather Service is advising residents in the states affected by the winter storm to stay off the roads. However, if you must drive, here's how to make sure your car stays free of ice and snow: Check to see that your vehicle has plenty of gas and necessary emergency supplies, such as a first aid kit, a flashlight and bottled water. Remove all the snow from your car, including the roof. Clear off windows to maximize visibility; do the same for your headlights to ensure that others can see you. More than a dozen states have been affected by the winter storm since it started traversing over the U.S. on Jan. 4, with several deaths reported as a direct consequences of the snow and ice. Missouri State Highway Patrol reported three deaths: A 33-year-old man who died after a parked truck slid down the road and hit him early on Jan. 4; a 61-year-old man who stepped out of his car and was hit by a truck that ""began to slide on the roadway"" and a 28-year-old man who was hit by a trailer ""swerving due to slick road conditions"" on Jan. 5. Kansas Highway Patrol wrote in a crash report that two people died after their car slid off the interstate. In Illinois, the Macon County Sheriff's Office said that a 10-year-old, who had been riding an inner tube in the snow with a friend, hit a boulder. He was taken to the hospital but died from his injuries. Kentucky is one of several states where officials have been urging people to stay off the roads due to icy conditions. According to the Associated Press, a truck stop in Florence, Ky., was ""jammed with big rigs"" driven by truckers who decided not to risk it. ""It was too dangerous. I didn't want to kill myself or anyone else,"" Michael Taylor, a long-haul driver from Los Angeles who was carrying a load of rugs to Macon, Ga., told the AP. He said he saw numerous cars and trucks stuck in ditches before deciding to pull off the interstate. ""It was crazy,"" Taylor said. ""I know when it's time to get off the roads."" The winter storm that has wreaked havoc across a large swath of the country ""will be quickly exiting eastward into the western Atlantic tonight,"" the National Weather Service said in its latest updated forecast. ""While the bulk of accumulating snowfall has ended, light additional accumulations will be possible across portions of the central Appalachians to the Mid-Atlantic coast early tonight,"" the weather service said. ""High pressure and colder temperatures will filter eastward from the central U.S. through Wednesday supporting relatively tranquil weather for much of the central and eastern U.S."" Meanwhile, an arctic blast moving in behind the storm will cause temperatures to be ""roughly 5 to 20 degrees below climatological daytime maxima"" from the Great Plains to the East Coast through Wednesday. With a snow emergency declared in Washington., D.C., hundreds of people turned out for a planned snowball fight at Meridian Hill Park on Monday. According to the D.C. Snowball Fight Association, which organized the event, it marked the 15th year of ""snowbilizing the masses on DC snow days."" According to the National Weather Service forecast, 6 to 12 inches of snow was expected to fall in the D.C. metro area. The winter storm has created some eye-popping snowfall totals from Kansas to New York. According to the National Weather Service, here are the highest 24-hour accumulations by state as of 2 p.m. ET: Stokes Corner, N.Y.: 75 inches Chapman and Saint George, Kan.: 18 inches Saint Joseph, Mo.: 16 inches Dawson, Neb.: 12.5 inches Cementville and Palmyra, Ind.: 12 inches Godfrey and Elsah, Ill.: 12 inches Easton, Md.: 11.5 inches Hebron, Ky.: 10.4 inches Covedale, Ohio: 10.3 inches Bridgeville, Del.: 10 inches Several deaths have been reported on icy roads during the storm. In Jackson County, Mo., officials announced Monday that a public works employee was killed while performing snow removal operations. The man, identified as Everett Carter, 61, died on Sunday afternoon when he was struck by a sliding dump truck, according to the Missouri State Highway Patrol. “This incident serves as a solemn reminder of the dedication and risks faced by public servants like Mr. Carter, who worked tirelessly to ensure the safety and well-being of our communities,” Jackson County officials said in a press release cited by NBC News. In Wichita, Kansas, the Kansas Highway Patrol said a 24-year-old man and 26-year-old woman were killed in a rollover crash, when the vehicle they were traveling in spun out on the interstate and flew down an embankment. The storm has caused severe air travel disruptions. According to FlightAware, more than 1,800 flights in and out of the U.S. have been canceled so far, including nearly 500 at Reagan National and more than 250 at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, which issued a temporary ground stop earlier Monday due to snow and ice. The Federation Aviation Administration warned that ground delays are possible this afternoon at New York's LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy International Airport and Newark Liberty International in New Jersey because of the icy conditions. More than 1,800 flights in the U.S. have been canceled so far Monday, according to FlightAware, with the vast majority due to the storm. According to federal law, airlines are required to provide refunds to customers whose flights are canceled. Here (from the Associated Press) are five tips for navigating flight cancelations: Most airlines will rebook you on a later flight for no additional charge. That depends, however, on the availability of open seats. You can ask to be put on another airline, but airlines aren’t required to put you on another carrier’s flight. If you no longer want to take the trip, or you find another way of getting to your destination, the airline is legally required to refund your money, even if you bought a nonrefundable ticket. It can help to reach out to airlines’ customer service representatives on X, the site formerly known as Twitter. You also can try calling your airline’s international help number — usually available online — since those agents can make changes to your itinerary too. On the heels of the winter storm, an arctic air mass will send temperatures plunging in 40 states this week, Fox Weather reported. ""More than 200 million people will see temperatures Monday that range from 5-30 degrees below average,"" Fox Weather said. ""Temperatures will then drop overnight below freezing for everyone across the country except the West Coast and Florida."" And it's shaping up to be a cold January, as ""frigid temperatures are expected to remain in place across the eastern half of the country for at least the next two weeks."" The storm is wreaking havoc on the nation's roadways. Virginia State Police said they responded to more than 200 vehicle crashes in a 12-hour period between 4 p.m. Sunday and 4 a.m. Monday, though not all accidents were storm-related. Similar figures were reported in Kentucky, where dispatchers responded to more than 170 vehicle accidents and over 280 stranded motorists. Officials in those states and others are urging people to stay off the roads. “This is a significant snow and ice event, so the roadways are still dangerous,” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said. “You might be able to see the pavement, but that doesn’t mean that it’s not slick."" The ongoing winter storm has knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of people, from Illinois to Virginia. According to PowerOutage.us, here are the five states with the most outages as of 12 p.m. ET: Virginia: 108,114 Kentucky: 75,708 Indiana: 53,407 West Virginia: 50,518 Illinois: 35,855 This storm is the Washington, D.C., area's first substantial snowfall of the winter season, with the National Weather Service reporting that the city has been hit with around 5 inches of snow as of early Monday morning. While federal offices are closed today because of the weather, Congress is still set to meet later this afternoon on Capitol Hill to certify President-elect Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 election. In addition to heavy snow in the mid-Atlantic, other areas of the country will see moderate to severe weather on Monday. According to the latest forecast from the National Weather Service, severe thunderstorms will develop over parts of the Southeast, which could produce isolated tornadoes. Lake-effect snow will continue to fall across the Great Lakes and parts of the Northeast Monday. In the Pacific Northwest, coastal rain and higher-elevation snow will continue through Tuesday.",672,[],2025-01-06 23:48:10,2025-01-07 01:51:55

(AP) — Donald Trump Jr. is heading to Greenland, visiting the Danish territory weeks after his father renewed suggestions that the U.S. could somehow take control of it. The younger Trump is going for a day trip to shoot video content for podcasting and will not be meeting with any government officials or political figures, according to a person familiar with the plans who was not authorized to speak publicly. Danish broadcaster DR cited the head of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Mininnguaq Kleist, in reporting that Trump Jr. would be arriving Tuesday for a private visit, and there are no inquiries about a meeting with the Greenland government. Greenland's prime minister, Múte B. Egede, hasn't commented. The island is an autonomous territory that is part of the Kingdom of Denmark. The visit comes after President-elect Donald Trump again made comments about controlling the area in a statement last month as he announced his pick for U.S. ambassador to Denmark. “For purposes of National Security and Freedom throughout the World, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity,” he said in a statement. Trump’s eldest son has become a prominent player in his father’s political movement and has served on his presidential transition team, helping to select the people who will staff the incoming White House. But Trump Jr. has said he has no plans to join his father’s administration, instead intending to stay a key supporter of his father and his agenda from the outside. He’s especially vocal online, where he often indulges in trolling and sharing memes and hosts his own twice-a-week podcast, “Triggered With Don Jr.” Greenland media also say Trump Jr. could potentially meeting with Erik Jensen, who is chairman of the governing party Siumut and the island’s equivalent to finance minister – though that hasn’t been confirmed. Also Monday, Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of Tesla and a close advisor to the president-elect, said on X, the social media site he owns, that “The People of Greenland should decide their future and I think they want to be part of America!” During his first term, Trump mused about purchasing Greenland, which gained home rule from Denmark in 1979. He even canceled a scheduled trip to Denmark in August 2019 after its prime minister dismissed the idea. The world's largest island, Greenland sits between the Atlantic and Arctic oceans and is 80% covered by an ice sheet and is home to a large U.S. military base. In response to Trump's December statement, Egede said, “Greenland is ours.” ""We are not for sale and will never be for sale,” he said in a statement. “We must not lose our years-long fight for freedom.” Greenland has its own parliament and government headed by Egede. New elections are expected to take place no later than April 6. Aaja Chemnitz, a member of Greenland’s parliament wrote in a post on Facebook that people in Greenland need to get better at saying no to the president-elect, writing that it is “incredible that some can be so naive to think happiness is made by us becoming American citizens” and that she doesn’t “want to be a piece of Trump’s hot dreams of expanding his empire to include our country."" ""Don’t let Trump control the Greenland election campaign and leave the population as losers in that game,” Chemnitz wrote. ___ Price reported from New York.

Chip Roy, a hardline Republican from Texas, told BI that it's time to put his ""foot on the gas"" for a stock trading ban.",Bryan Metzger,2025-01-06T21:06:25.000Z,"There's been little movement in recent years, especially in the House, on banning stock trading. That could change this year, with a group of hardline Republicans now pushing the issue. ""I need to put my foot on the gas a little bit,"" said Rep. Chip Roy. ""Let's deal with it."" For years, lawmakers in both parties have tried to pass legislation to ban members of Congress from trading stocks. It's popular with the American public. Both outgoing President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump support it. A bipartisan group of senators came together around a single stock trading ban bill this past summer, and two years ago, the House almost took a vote on a bill hastily put forward by House Democratic leadership. However, an actual floor vote in either chamber has long remained elusive. Now, some hardline House Republicans are hoping to change that. ""I'm tired of my colleagues sticking their heads in the sand on it. It needs to be dealt with, sooner rather than later,"" Rep. Chip Roy of Texas told Business Insider in a brief interview on Friday. Roy and 10 other members of the House Freedom Caucus board sent a letter to Speaker Mike Johnson on Friday expressing their ""sincere reservations"" with his tenure. Many of those lawmakers initially withheld their votes for Johnson, only to relent out of deference to Trump. In that letter, the GOP hardliners outlined a series of rule changes they wanted to see, along with policy items that they expected Johnson to put up for a vote. Among those items: Ending stock trading by members of Congress. ""If that's what it takes to gain some confidence by the public in the fact that members of Congress work ethically, then I think that's a small price to pay,"" Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, told BI. Today, the Board of the House Freedom Caucus released the attached letter to their Republican colleagues regarding today's vote for Speaker. pic.twitter.com/lV1ZLnT0aC — House Freedom Caucus (@freedomcaucus) January 3, 2025 Roy has long been the leader GOP cosponsor of one of the leading bills to ban stock trading, the TRUST in Congress Act, and he told BI that it was his idea to add that demand to the letter. He also happens to be one of Johnson's chief critics, and could — in coordination with the other Republicans — threaten the speaker with a vote on his ouster if the House doesn't take up that legislation. As of now, it's not clear whether that will happen. Roy said that banning lawmakers from trading stocks is ""not as existential to the functioning of the average American family on a daily basis"" as some of the other priorities laid out in the letter, including steep cuts to federal spending and enacting tough border security and immigration measures. The Texas Republican did express frustration with the lack of progress on the issue over the last several years while hinting that this year could be different. ""It's been sitting out there for three or four years, we kind of keep dragging feet, and it's time to deal with it,"" said Roy. ""I need to put my foot on the gas a little bit, and so I'm putting my foot on the gas."" As of now, Roy says that ""foot on the gas"" involves laying out the demand and talking with Johnson and other relevant committee chairs about moving the legislation. Johnson, for his part, has not publicly expressed a position on a stock trading ban, and a spokesperson did not provide a position when contacted by Business Insider on Monday. His predecessor, former Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, did express support for a stock trading ban. ""The perception of Congress, whether true or not, is that some may take advantage of insider information,"" Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee, another Freedom Caucus letter signatory, told BI. ""This is a gesture to say, 'Hey, look, we're not treated any differently.'"" Despite widespread agreement on the principle, the details of an eventual ban aren't widely agreed upon, and different bills propose different things. Some legislation would ban the ownership of stocks altogether, but Ogles said that ""active day-trading"" is the real problem. ""It doesn't mean you can't own stock, so that you can't have mutual funds,"" Ogles said. Meanwhile, some House Freedom Caucus members still trade stocks, and one — Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida — violated a federal law requiring timely disclosure of stock trades in the fall of 2024. A September 2024 report from the Campaign Legal Center found that 44% of House members and 54% of senators own stock.

(AP) — President-elect Donald Trump is promising to replace the head of the National Archives, thrusting the agency back into the political spotlight after his mishandling of sensitive documents led to a federal indictment. “We will have a new archivist,"" Trump told radio host Hugh Hewitt on Monday. The agency piqued Trump's ire after it alerted the Department of Justice about potential problems with Trump’s handling of classified documents in early 2022. That set in motion an investigation that led to a dramatic FBI search of Trump's home at Mar-a-Lago, which culminated in him becoming the first former president charged with federal crimes. The current archivist, Colleen Shogan, the first woman in the role, wasn't in the post at that time. David Ferriero, who had been appointed by President Barack Obama in 2009, announced in January 2022 that he'd be retiring effective that April. Shogan was nominated by President Joe Biden in August 2022, just days before the FBI search at Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, Florida. But she was not confirmed until May of the following year, after a monthslong partisan battle over the agency’s role in the documents investigation. The national archivist can be removed from office by the president, who can choose a successor who is then confirmed by the Senate, so Trump's promise to do so is not unusual. Still, Trump has vowed to smash what he calls the “ deep state,” a nebulous term referring generally to the federal government, including civil servants and bureaucrats he argues are hostile to his ideological views and those of Republicans more broadly. Presidents are legally required to provide most of their records to the National Archives once they leave office. When the National Archives realized that some documents were missing from its collection after Trump left office, they made repeated demands for him to return them, according to the federal indictment. Trump eventually turned over some of the documents but hid others, the indictment charged. He was indicted by special counsel Jack Smith on charges including willful retention of national defense information, conspiracy to obstruct justice and false statements and representations. He pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing. Prosecutors moved to abandon the case after his Election Day victory in November. That was consistent with long-standing Justice Department policy that says sitting presidents cannot face criminal prosecution.",931,[],2025-01-07 00:17:41,2025-01-07 00:17:41

The 46-year-old mother of three shared two unedited photos of herself proudly posing in a bright orange bikini along with a lengthy message about her evolving relationship with her appearance. “This year I became aware of the aesthetic pressure of my work in a brand new way, while simultaneously I experienced new levels of self-love and genuine confidence from within,"" Furtado wrote. The “Say It Right” singer added that she took legal action “against a few charlatans online selling health and beauty myths” using her likeness. “For whoever cares, I have never had any face or body surgeries or augmentation, besides for veneers on the top row of my teeth quite recently,” she wrote. Furtado said she hasn’t had any face or lip filler “so far” but does have a facialist who she has trusted for more than 20 years. Aside from drinking plenty of water and sleeping on her back before photoshoots a red carpet appearances, Furtado said she sometimes relies on a tried and true Hollywood beauty trick: Face tape. “Sometimes on the red carpet or at photo shoots my makeup artist uses face tape to give my eyes, skin and makeup more lift,” she wrote. Face tape has been a beauty hack for Hollywood makeup artists for decades as non-surgical way to temporarily lift the face. Strategically placed tape can be placed at the temples to lift the eyes and brows for the perfect cat-eye or to help lift and sculpt the cheeks and jawline. Lady Gaga, Bella Hadid and Chrissy Teigen are a few A-list celebs who have relied on face tape to alter their appearance on the red carpet. “Sometimes my stylist uses body tape to give a certain look to different silhouettes. Body makeup can also sometimes be contoured to achieve a certain look,"" she continued. ""Makeup can do magical things ! So can great eyebrows! So can a great hairstylist! So can great underthings!"" The star says she's also learned to embrace her body. ""I have spider veins and they remind me of my mom and aunties and life so I think that’s why I haven’t parted with them so far,"" she wrote. Furtado encouraged her followers to step into the New Year with confidence. ""...Express yourself freely, celebrate your individuality and know that it’s perfectly OK to be OK with what you see in the mirror and it’s also OK to want something different."" The post earned praise from fans and followers who thanked the star for being candid about beauty and body image. ""Wish more celebrities would explain the tricks of the trade to both women old and young...,"" a follower wrote. ""As a nearly 40-year-old woman who knows these things, I still find myself wishing for body standards that are impossible to achieve by even those who appear to have them. I wonder what would have happened if more celebrities spoke out as I was growing up."" ""You're amazing Nelly, thank you for teaching us such an important lesson,"" another added. ""You're beautiful the way you are, and it is even more beautiful seeing you love and embrace yourself publicly the way you're doing it."" ""Hats off for this honest post!"" someone echoed.

Until the Liberals appoint a new leader, Trudeau will stay on as Canada's prime minister. ""I intend to resign as party leader, as prime minister, after the party selects its next leader through a robust nationwide competitive process,"" Trudeau said. ""Last night, I asked the president of the Liberal Party to begin that process. This country deserves a real choice in the next election, and it has become clear to me that if I am having to fight internal battles I cannot be the best option in that election."" In his announcement, Trudeau said that he made a request for Parliament to be prorogued, one that will be granted until March 24. It means MPs won't meet in the House of Commons for any parliamentary activities, as the Liberals remain in power. Both the Conservatives and NDP have signalled that they'll call for a non-confidence vote the first chance they get, which would trigger an election. Party leaders Pierre Poilievre and Jagmeet Singh both called on Canadians to not trust the Liberals any further, despite who they end up choosing as their leader, and that instead it's time to put their faith in a new party. South of the border, U.S.-President-elect Donald Trump also weighed in, as he furthered his agenda of making Canada the ""51st state."" Many Canadians took to social media to thank Trudeau after his nine years of service as prime minister. Over the past month, Trudeau has faced increased scrutiny since former finance minister Chrystia Freeland resigned in December, as she wrote a letter calling out his ""political gimmicks"" in the face of Trump's tariff threats. Calls for Trudeau to resign have grown among MPs of all parties, including the Liberals. The prime minister’s resignation comes at a bad time for the party, with polls showing that they would lose to Poilievre's Conservatives. In his resignation announcement, Trudeau answered questions from reporters, as he warned Canadians about a future in which Polievre and the Conservatives are in charge. The next federal election must take place on or before Oct. 20, 2025. Below, you'll find more reaction and analysis from throughout the day, in what was a historic moment in Canadian politics. With Trudeau announcing that he will step down as leader of the Liberal Party, it starts the process of finding his replacement. As part of the Liberals' constitution, party president Sachit Mehra has called a meeting, which will be held this week in order to begin a ""nationwide democratic process of selecting a new leader of the party."" When it comes to who's eligible to run, there are several criteria that need to met, like being registered Liberals and being allowed to run in a federal election. Their written nominations also must feature 300 signatures from registered Liberals. As of publication, no one has formally announced that they'll be running for the position. However, some popular names have been circulating among political circles, including former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, current Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc, former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney, Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly, former Liberal MP Frank Baylis, and former B.C. premier Christy Clark, according to the CBC. With Parliament prorogued until March 24, it creates a small window in order for the Liberals to find their new leader and appear united. For more on the process of finding a new replacement, read CBC's comprehensive coverage here. In the wake of a ""critical moment,"" Ontario Premier Doug Ford has taken to X to share his belief that the federal government needs to focus on doing whatever it takes to avoid possible U.S. tariffs. The post came just after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced he would be resigning as leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. ""The federal government needs to do everything humanly possible to avoid these tariffs,"" Ford wrote. ""Canada needs to demonstrate stability and strength at this critical moment, and the federal government must urgently explain to Canadians how they will avoid tariffs that could have devastating effects on our economy."" Ford has been vocal about the need for a proper approach in dealing with Trump's tariff threat, considering the impact it would have on Ontario. President-elect Trump continues to make real threats about imposing sweeping tariffs that would devastate Canada’s economy. In two weeks, the president-elect will be sworn in as America’s next president and will have every opportunity to make his threats real. Between now and… — Doug Ford (@fordnation) January 6, 2025 As political leaders react to his resignation announcement, Canadians are taking to social media to thank Justin Trudeau for his work as Canada's prime minister over the past nine years. Many are applauding his role during the COVID-19 pandemic, how he weathered Canada's relationship with the U.S. during Donald Trump's first presidency, and also his ability to help advance social issues.

""Justin Trudeau's Liberals have let down Canadians,"" Singh said in a Monday afternoon press conference. ""They have let you down when it comes to the cost of homes. He's let you down when it comes to the cost of living. And frankly, it's not just Justin Trudeau, it's every Liberal minister, every Liberal MP who looked down their nose at you when people were saying 'We can't make ends meet, we are struggling with the cost of living.'"" ""So it doesn't matter who the next Liberal leader is. They have let you down. They do not deserve another chance. They're more interested in themselves than the struggles of Canadians."" Singh re-iterated the serious threat of Donald Trump's second presidency and his promised tariffs on Canadian goods and how the Liberals are more concerned with securing their jobs. The NDP leader is also warning against the threat of Pierre Poilievre and the Conservatives, who are leading in vote intention polls. ""They want to cut your pensions. They want to cut health care. They want to cut dental care, all to make their rich CEO buddies even richer,"" Singh said. He added: ""Canadians, give us a chance. Give us the honour of leading this country."" Below is my statement on Justin Trudeau’s resignation.  If you oppose callous Conservative cuts. If you oppose the rich getting richer while everyone else falls further behind. Stand with the NDP this time: https://t.co/7rFS9LdsDh pic.twitter.com/hQRB4XvRZu — Jagmeet Singh (@theJagmeetSingh) January 6, 2025 Singh has faced criticism over the past few months. It started in September, when he ended the NDP's supply and confidence agreement with the Liberals. However, he was reluctant to join the Conservatives in their motion for a non-confidence vote. On Dec. 20, just after the closing of Parliament for the winter holiday break, Singh said he would now support a non-confidence motion. With Justin Trudeau's announced resignation, U.S.-President elect Donald Trump took to his Truth Social platform to suggest ""many"" Canadians would ""LOVE being the 51st State."" ""The United States can no longer suffer the massive trade deficits and subsidies that Canada needs to stay afloat. Justin Trudeau knew this, and resigned,"" Trump wrote. Trump said ""no tariffs"" would be imposed if ""Canada merged with the U.S.,"" a threat he's been making ever since being elected in November. A poll from Leger last month found that only 13 per cent of Canadians are warm to the idea of the country becoming the ""51st state."" More leaders in Canada's political landscape reacted to Trudeau's news, including Chrystia Freeland, Pierre Poilievre and Jagmeet Singh. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre says Justin Trudeau's announcement that he will resign does not change the outlook for the Liberal Party of Canada. ""Canadians desperate to turn the page on this dark chapter in our history might be relieved today that Justin Trudeau is finally leaving. But what has really changed?"" Polievere asked. ""Every Liberal MP in power today and every potential Liberal leadership contender fighting for the top job helped Justin Trudeau break the country over the last nine years."" Nothing has changed. Every Liberal MP and Leadership contender supported EVERYTHING Trudeau did for 9 years, and now they want to trick voters by swapping in another Liberal face to keep ripping off Canadians for another 4 years, just like Justin.The only way to fix what… pic.twitter.com/YnNYANTs1y — Pierre Poilievre (@PierrePoilievre) January 6, 2025 Polievere cited the carbon tax, government spending, as well the Liberals' immigration, housing and crime policies. ""Their only objection is that [Trudeau] is no longer popular enough to win an election and keep them in power,"" Poilievre said. ""They want to protect their pensions and paycheques by sweeping their hated leader under the rug months before an election, to trick you and then do it all over again."" Trudeau has faced increased pressure to step down since his former finance minister Chrystia Freeland resigned on Dec. 16 in a letter to the prime minister. Initially, Trudeau had asked Freeland to step down from the post of finance minister for another position in his cabinet. Instead, Freeland decided to leave altogether, citing that she could not do her job while having a lack of ""confidence"" from the PM. Some view Freeland's resignation, and her scathing letter, as the ""catalyst"" to what led to Trudeau's decision on Monday. When asked to comment on his side of what happened, Trudeau said he isn't ""someone who's in the habit of sharing private conversations."" ""Chrystia has been by my side for close to 10 years now,"" Trudeau said. ""She has been an incredible political partner through just about everything we have done as a government and as a party over the past decade I had really hoped that she would agree to continue as my deputy prime minister and take on one of the most important files that not just this government but this country is facing, but she chose otherwise."" On Monday, Trudeau was asked how the Liberals can be in a position to protect Canadian businesses from the threat of Donald Trump's tariffs, as the party looks to appoint a new leader in the next two months. Trudeau's resignation comes just two weeks before U.S.-President-elect Donald Trump gets sworn into office.Since his election win in November 2024, Trump has repeatedly made threats that the U.S. will impose high tariffs on Canadian goods. ""The Cabinet will still be very much focused on doing the job that Canadians elected us to do in 2021, which is fight for their interests, stand up for their well being, and make sure that they are good and that Canadians are protected and strong. ""There will be a leadership process and the rules will unfold over the coming weeks, but I can assure you that the tools and the need to stand up for Canadians, to protect Canadians and their interests and continue to fight for the economy is something that everyone in this government will be singularly focused on."" With all eyes on Justin Trudeau, the prime minister stepped out at his residence, Rideau Cottage in Ottawa, to announce his decision to step down as the Liberal leader. When Parliament resumes March 24, it's expected that calls for a non-confidence vote will continue. If that vote takes place and the government fails, then an election will be triggered. This will put the new Liberal leader front and centre in the race against the Conservatives and Pierre Poilievre, who are favoured to win the election according to polls. Trudeau believes that stepping down gives his party a better chance. ""There is always going to be the challenge of having a leadership race while a Parliament would face confidence votes in the course of delivering supply to the government,"" Trudeau said. ""So this is something that we're going to navigate through. But I truly feel that removing the contention around my own continued leadership is an opportunity to bring the temperature down, have a government that will focus on the complex issues that are coming forward in the coming months, while the party gets to have a full national process that brings in people from right across the country and makes a determination about the best person to carry the progressive, Liberal standard into the next election."" With Trudeau's granted request to prorogue Parliament, it stops MPs from being able to pass a non-confidence vote, which would trigger a federal election. The Conservatives have tabled many motions seeking a non-confidence vote against Trudeau and the Liberals since fall 2024. Following Freeland's resignation, Jagmeet Singh and the NDP said they would join the Conservatives in passing a non-confidence vote. On Monday, Trudeau defended his decision to prorogue Parliament, saying that it's ""time for a reset."" ""Anyone who's been watching politics closely over the past months will know that Parliament has been entirely seized by obstruction and filibustering and a total lack of productivity. ""It's time for the temperature to come down, for the people to have a fresh start in Parliament, to be able to navigate through these complex times, both domestically and internationally. And the reset that we have is actually two parts. One is the prorogation, but the other part is recognizing that removing me from the equation as the leader who will fight the next election for the Liberal Party should also decrease the level of polarization that we're seeing right now in the House and in Canadian politics, and allow people to actually focus on serving Canadians in this House and with their work the way Canadians deserve."" Trudeau “absolutely” believes that there is another Liberal leader who can defeat Pierre Poilievre’s Conservatives in an upcoming federal election. Before giving his answer, the PM took time to remind Canadians of who he believes Poilievre truly is. “Poilievre’s vision for this country is not the right one for Canadians,” Trudeau said. “Stopping the fight against climate change doesn't make sense. Backing off on the values and strength and diversity that Canada has always worked to pull itself together on, is not the right path for the country. Attacking journalists, the CBC institutions, that's not what Canadians need in this moment. ""We need an ambitious, optimistic view of the future, and Pierre Poilievre is not offering that, and I look forward to the fight as progressives across this country stand up for the kind of vision for a better country that Canadians have always carried despite the tremendous pressures around the world to think smaller, to veer towards the far right and to be less ambitious for what we can be and do as a country when the world really needs Canada.” Justin Trudeau has requested that Parliament be prorogued, which Governor General Mary Simon has granted until March 24. ""Parliament has been paralyzed for months after what has been the longest session of a minority Parliament in Canadian history,"" Trudeau said at his press conference on Monday. Justin Trudeau says he will step down as prime minister and leader of the Liberal Party of Canada after a new leader has been selected. He made the statement Monday morning at Rideau Cottage. It remains unclear if Justin Trudeau will stay on as prime minister, even after stepping down as the Liberal leader. He could wait until a new party leader is selected. According to The Globe, the Liberal Party national executive plans to meet next week, likely after Wednesday's national caucus session, where they will make their leadership decision. The Liberals can either appoint an interim leader or hold a shortened leadership contest. In the event that they choose the latter, it wold require the Governor-General Mary Simon to prorogue Parliament, which isn't a guarantee. The prime minister will hold an announcement at 10:45 a.m. ET at Rideau Cottage on Monday morning. CBC and the Toronto Star are reporting that Justin Trudeau will use this opportunity to formally announce his resignation. Yahoo News Canada will have the live feed as part of this article, so be sure to check back in.

Before then, the teams on the outside looking will likely be making headlines. Las Vegas Raiders: Antonio Pierce still has his job. As far as he knows, at least. The Las Vegas Raiders head coach told reporters at his Monday news conference that he hasn't ""heard anything different"" regarding his job status on the heels of a 4-13 campaign featuring more than its share of turmoil. Team owner Mark Davis had not addressed the Raiders' coaching job as of the time of Pierce's news conference. Jacksonville Jaguars: Jags owner Shad Khan released a statement Monday announcing the firing of Doug Pederson, a move that had been expected since the middle of the season. The 4-13 Jaguars started 2024 with a four-game losing streak, then lost five straight games from Week 8 through 13 while QB Trevor Lawrence had another injury-filled season. While Pederson has been fired, general manager Trent Baalke will remain in place. New England Patriots: The Patriots now need a new head coach after firing Jerod Mayo right after their Week 18 victory over the Bills, which meant they lost out on the No. 1 overall pick. With Drake Maye in place, it's an attractive opening, as much as the rest of the roster needs work. Team owner Robert Kraft will presumably have more patience with the next hire than Mayo, a former Patriots player who lasted just one season replacing Bill Belichick. New Orleans Saints: Dennis Allen was fired on Nov. 4 after a seventh straight loss that evaporated a strong 2-0 start. Allen went 18-25 in three seasons in New Orleans and failed to make the postseason. Darren Rizzi finished the 2024 campaign 5-12. Whoever takes the reins faces a rebuild amid the Saints' usual salary-cap headaches and uncertainty at the QB position. New York Jets: This is one of the messier positions in the league as the franchise is also looking for a general manager. The club fired head coach Robert Saleh on Oct. 8 after starting 2-3 and GM Joe Douglas was dismissed six weeks later. While the team has begun interviews, it's unclear whether QB Aaron Rodgers will be part of the new regime. Mike Vrabel reportedly interviewed for the job last week, along with Ron Rivera. ESPN analyst Louis Riddick interviewed for the GM position. Chicago Bears: The Bears made history by firing their head coach in-season for the first time, with Thomas Brown taking over as the team was amid a 10-game losing streak that ended with a win over the Packers in the season finale. Whoever replaces Matt Eberflus will be charged primarily with getting No. 1 overall pick Caleb Williams on track after a rocky rookie season. The list of head coach openings could grow in the coming days, but the New York Giants will not be looking for new leadership. Team co-owner John Mara announced Monday that head coach Brian Daboll and general manager Joe Schoen will remain in place for the 2025 season. However, the Dallas Cowboys (Mike McCarthy) may be among the teams that could make a change at head coach. As for the teams that will turn their attention to playoff preparation over the next two weeks, here's a look at next weekend's matchups. Follow along with Yahoo Sports as the NFL turns the page from the regular season to the playoffs. After a rough 4-13 season, the Jaguars have fired head coach Doug Pederson. But general manager Trent Baalke will stay in his position ""I strongly believe it is possible next season to restore the winning environment we had here not long ago,"" owner Shad Khan said in a statement. ""I will collaborate with general manager Trent Baalke and others, within and close to our organization, to hire a leader who shares my ambition and is ready to sieze the extraordinary opportunity we will offer in Jacksonville."" Click here to read more about Pederson's firing and his difficult tenure in Jacksonville. Rex Ryan is not only confident he's going to become the next head coach of the Jets, but he believes he can reign in Aaron Rodgers. ""If he's back, it ain't gonna be the country club, show up whenever the hell you want to show up,"" Ryan said. ""That ain't gonna happen. I'll just leave it at that.” The search for a new Chicago Bears coach is on in earnest with the conclusion of the NFL's regular season, and it reportedly includes a surprising new candidate. Per ESPN, the Bears have requested permission from the Dallas Cowboys to interview their head coach Mike McCarthy. Per the report, the Bears are now awaiting a response from the Cowboys and owner Jerry Jones. For more, read here. The Lions are off this week and will play the winner of the Vikings/Rams wild card game in the divisional round. The #Saints requested an interview with #Lions DC Aaron Glenn for their head coaching job, per source. A former New Orleans assistant, Glenn was the runner-up for the job last time. The #Bears and #Jets requested him too. — Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) January 6, 2025 Quarterback Jalen Hurts remains in concussion protocol as the Philadelphia Eagles prepare for Sunday's wild-card game against the Green Bay Packers. Head coach Nick Sirianni told the media on Monday that Hurts is still in the protocol following the concussion he sustained early in the Eagles' Week 16 game against the Washington Commanders. He missed the remainder of the game, which the Eagles lost, and didn't play in Week 17 or 18. Kenny Pickett filled in for Hurts in Week 16 and part of Week 17. Tanner McKee stepped in after Pickett took a nasty shot to the ribs in Week 17, then made his very first NFL start against the New York Giants in Week 18. Sirianni didn't give any details, which has been true of every ""update"" he's given since Hurts entered the protocol following Week 16. The Eagles haven't released any information on whether Hurts has been progressing through the various stages of the protocol, but Sirianni confirmed that Hurts was present at Saturday's walkthrough.

Bears requested head coaching interviews with Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores and Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith, per source. — Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) January 6, 2025 The Saints put in a request to interview Bills OC Joe Brady, per source. — Dianna Russini (@DMRussini) January 6, 2025 Las Vegas Raiders head coach Antonio Pierce spoke with media on Monday, and he still has his job. As far as he knows, at least. Pierce told reporters that he hasn't ""heard anything different"" about his job status on the heels of a 4-13 season. #Raiders HC Antonio Pierce says he hasn't ""heard anything different"" other than he's back for 2025. Says all of that talk is coming from the outside, not the inside. — Mike Garafolo (@MikeGarafolo) January 6, 2025 The Bears have requested permission to interview Giants offensive coordinator Mike Kafka for their open head coaching job. He'll be one of many interviewing for that open position, so there is a plan B in play... And that plan B could be the Seahawks, who just fired Ryan Grubb as their offensive coordinator. A year ago, the Seahawks and their new head coach Mike Macdonald had requested permission to interview Kafka to be their new OC, but the Giants blocked their request. With the Giants trying to remake themselves without replacing their head coach or GM, they're unlikely to want to hold on to coordinators like Kafka. If the Bears don't work out, Kafka might head for Seattle. Rex Ryan, former Jets head coach, wants to be their head coach again. He's got a chance, as he's on the growing list of candidates (now up to 12) the Jets are interviewing. But Ryan is exceedingly confident that he's going to get the job, as he said during a radio interview on Monday morning. Rex Ryan told @HDumpty39 and @RothenbergESPN that he loves his chances of landing the Jets head coaching job.pic.twitter.com/5zqfPRzJva — Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) January 6, 2025 The Seahawks are making a change at offensive coordinator, reportedly firing Ryan Grubb after one season with the team, his first coaching at any level in the NFL. Seahawks' first-year head coach Mike Macdonald hired Grubb onto his staff following a long career in offensive college coaching. He was hired by Kalen DeBoer as a member of the Sioux Falls coaching team, and followed DeBoer to Eastern Michigan, Fresno State, and finally to Washington, where DeBoer named him assistant head coach, offensive coordinator, and quarterbacks coach.

Flowers exited Saturday's game with an apparent leg injury after going down hard on a catch-and-run. The 24-year-old Flowers immediately grabbed at his right knee and was in visible pain. He was escorted to the medical tent with a pronounced limp, then went to the locker room. The Ravens initially announced Flowers as questionable to return with a knee injury, but later downgraded his status to out. The Ravens will host the Steelers on Saturday night at 8 p.m. ET. Ravens coach John Harbaugh said Pro Bowl WR Zay Flowers’ right knee injury is not a season-ending one.Flowers is considered “day to day” heading onto the wild-card game against the Steelers, according to Harbaugh. — Jamison Hensley (@jamisonhensley) January 6, 2025 The Jets are reportedly adding Chiefs offensive coordinator Matt Nagy to the interview request list for their head coaching opening. That's the same Matt Nagy who was head coach of the Bears from 2018 to 2021. The Jets already have Lions DC Aaron Glenn on their interview list. In addition to Nagy and Glenn, the Jets are reportedly requesting an interview with Steelers OC Arthur Smith, who was previously the head coach of the Falcons. The Jets have requested Chiefs OC Matt Nagy for the HC vacancy, per source — Dianna Russini (@DMRussini) January 6, 2025 The #Jets know Arthur Smith: He interviewed twice for the job four years ago, before Smith landed in Atlanta and New York hired Robert Saleh. https://t.co/re6JOXdIcq — Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) January 6, 2025 Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson and defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn are two of the most in-demand head coaching candidates. Thus far, the Bears have reportedly requested interviews with both of them for their HC opening. Johnson has also reportedly gotten an interview request from the Patriots, while Glenn has a request coming from the Jets. The #Patriots also put in a request to interview #Lions OC Ben Johnson for their head coaching job, per source. https://t.co/KjxWe3qjGZ — Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) January 6, 2025 Browns GM Andrew Berry announced Monday morning that QB Deshaun Watson has experienced a ""setback"" in his recovery from a torn Achilles. They don't have much information yet on the nature of the setback and how it might affect his overall timetable, but Berry said it will ""extend the recovery process."" Berry said it's ""too early to tell"" if Watson will be able to play in 2025.

But he's not going to interview for all of them. The Athletic's Diana Russini reported that Johnson is going to be picky about his options, and one team is already off the list: the Jets. Ben Johnson has made it very clear he’s not taking interviews with every organization looking for a HC. If the Jets had a better quarterback situation, there would be more interest. https://t.co/1jgZ9eYBuZ — Dianna Russini (@DMRussini) January 6, 2025 The Bengals had a sizzling offense this season, but their defense wasn't up to the same level. So it's not terribly surprising that Cincy has reportedly fired defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo, who had been in the position since 2019. They've also reportedly fired OL coach Frank Pollack, LB coach James Bettcher, and DL coach Marion Hobby. According to The Athletic's Diana Russini, Anarumo is expected to be a top candidate for several DC openings around the league. Click here to read more about the Bengals' staff shakeup. BREAKING: Sources confirm #Bengals part ways with DC Lou Anarumo, OL coach Frank Pollack, LB coach James Bettcher and DL coach Marion Hobby. — Paul Dehner Jr. (@pauldehnerjr) January 6, 2025 The Jaguars have fired Doug Pederson, but they aren't just changing their head coach. According to Fox Sports' Peter Schrager, there will be a new reporting structure in place for 2025. Instead of reporting to GM Trent Baalke, the new head coach will report directly to owner Shad Khan. Trent Baalke stays in JAX. As I said on @gmfb , the structure will be different -- new coach will report to owner, not GM-- but new coach will be inheriting GM from previous era. — Peter Schrager (@PSchrags) January 6, 2025 Unfortunately for Giants fans, the planes flying protest banners over MetLife Stadium did not change owner John Mara's mind about his team's leadership. Mara released a statement Monday morning affirming what fans feared most: general manager Joe Schoen and head coach Brian Daboll will continue in their roles next season despite a 3-14 record.

Chief among them: Will Antonio Pierce return for a second season as a head coach? His first full year after an interim stint didn't leave much to like. Then again, he didn't have a lot to work with. Now the Raiders are in position to revamp their quarterback room and add pieces in the offseason. Expect minority owner Tom Brady to have a huge say in their future. The first decision to come figures to be Pierce. Given the Raiders and other teams having legitimate interest in hiring Mike Vrabel, I believe he's the name of gravity concerning the Patriots' firing of Jerod Mayo. This will be New England's last shot to pursue him. He almost certainly will not be available down the line. After just one season, the New England Patriots are moving on from head coach Jerod Mayo. The Patriots fired their head coach just hours after their season-ending win over the Buffalo Bills on Sunday. For more on the Patriots' decision to fire Jerod Mayo, click here.

Browns' offense struggled mightily in 2024 The early window of Week 18 action is over, and 20 teams' seasons have ended. In years past, the first Monday after the regular season was known as Black Monday because of the coach firings. In recent years, some teams haven't even waited that long, turning Week 18's evening into Black Sunday.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/7-major-questions-alcohol-cancer-224259966.html,7 major questions about alcohol and cancer: What doctors think you should know,,Health,NBC News,7 min read,"After the surgeon general suggested that labels on alcoholic drinks should warn about cancer risk, here’s what doctors say you should know about drinking and cancer.",Aria Bendix,2025-01-06T22:42:59.000Z,"Doctors on Friday applauded a new report from the U.S. surgeon general that highlights links between alcohol consumption and seven types of cancer and suggests that alcoholic drinks should come with cancer warning labels. The association between alcohol and cancer is well established, and many doctors have long called on the federal government to make the connection clearer to the public. “For years, the AMA has said that alcohol consumption at any level, not just heavy alcohol use or addictive alcohol use, is a modifiable risk factor for cancer,” Bruce Scott, president of the American Medical Association, said in a statement. “And yet, despite decades of compelling evidence of this connection, too many in the public remain unaware of alcohol’s risk.” In the new report, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy outlines the scientific evidence linking alcohol to cancer and offers recommendations to reduce rates of alcohol-related cancers. In addition to proposing warning labels on alcoholic drinks, Murthy suggests reassessing the recommended limits for alcohol consumption in the U.S. Six in 10 U.S. adults report that they drink, but several doctors told NBC News that their patients generally aren’t aware that alcohol consumption can lead to cancers of the mouth, throat, esophagus, larynx, liver, breast and colon. “We have not done a good job with public health messaging about alcohol in the United States,” said Dr. Rotonya Carr, head of gastroenterology at the University of Washington. The new report may raise questions for some people about the long-term damage of drinking, safe limits and how to reverse the negative health effects. Here is what medical experts across the country think people should know. The World Health Organization says there’s no safe amount of alcohol consumption. As alcohol breaks down in the body, it can damage DNA and proteins in a way that may allow cancer to develop. It can also alter hormone levels and make it easier for the body to absorb other carcinogens like tobacco smoke, thereby increasing the risk of breast, mouth or throat cancers. “The safest thing for all sorts of health outcomes, not just cancer, is no alcohol consumption,” said Paul Gilbert, an associate professor at the University of Iowa College of Public Health. “But, of course, not many people go that route, because alcohol is such an important, central part of our social and cultural customs.” The health risks associated with drinking are lower if you drink less and higher if you drink more. A 2020 study found that among women, the risk of developing an alcohol-related cancer in one’s lifetime was 17% for those who consumed less than one drink per week, but 22% for those who consumed two drinks daily. For men, the risks were 10% and 13%, respectively. Alcohol is the third leading preventable cause of cancer in the U.S., behind tobacco and obesity, according to the surgeon general’s report. It estimates that alcohol contributes to nearly 100,000 cancer cases and about 20,000 cancer deaths annually. The WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies alcohol as a “Group 1” carcinogen, meaning there’s sufficient evidence that it can cause cancer in humans. Other carcinogens in that group include tobacco, asbestos and radiation. Given that, Carr said, people should be as worried about the health risks of drinking as they are about smoking. Compared to smoking, doctors said, there’s less research on how long it takes to see reductions in cancer risk after a person stops drinking. (Studies have estimated that people who quit smoking 10 years ago have half the risk of dying from lung cancer than someone who currently smokes cigarettes.) While some research has found that a single month of sobriety — a dry January, say — can lead to weight loss and improved blood pressure and cholesterol levels, the story is less optimistic when it comes to cancer risk, Carr said. She noted that it can take at least 20 years after someone stops drinking for their risk of liver cancer to equal that of a person who has abstained from alcohol. “Alcohol does do damage at the cellular level,” she said. “That damage sometimes can be undone, but over a very, very long period of time.” Dr. Frances Lee, a hepatologist at Mount Sinai in New York, said many factors could influence the degree to which a person might see benefits from reducing their drinking, including their family history. “For someone who has been binge drinking a lot, there is likely a lot of DNA damage,” she said. “If there’s a history of certain cancers, then perhaps they won’t be able to undo that risk.” The current guidelines recommend no more than one drink per day for women and two per day for men, based on an overall assessment of the health risks associated with alcohol. According to a study last year, about 83% of yearly alcohol-related cancer deaths could be prevented if adults lowered their consumption to within those limits. However, the guidelines also point to “emerging evidence” that even drinking within the recommended limits may increase the overall risk of cancer, heart disease or death. The guidelines are set to be updated this year, so Murthy’s suggestion that the alcohol limits be reassessed may factor into that process. A forthcoming report from a group within the Department of Health and Human Services will also likely inform the update. Last year, Canada issued new guidance stating that no amount of alcohol is healthy. Some studies over the years have pointed to potential health benefits of drinking in moderation. That includes research suggesting that the antioxidants in red wine could improve heart health, and a December report from the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine that said moderate drinking is linked to a lower risk of death than abstaining from alcohol. However, many doctors and scientists remain unconvinced. “There was lots of talk in years past about the benefit, potentially, of red wine. A lot of that has been difficult to validate in further studies,” said Dr. William Dahut, chief scientific officer for the American Cancer Society. Even if there were some health benefit to drinking, experts said, it would be offset by the risks. “I don’t think you’ll ever find a doctor who will tell a patient, ‘You don’t drink at all. Go ahead and drink two glasses at night,’” Lee said. Doctors said it’s most important to pay attention to the quantity or concentration of alcohol, as opposed to whether it’s liquor, beer or wine, since the alcohol molecules themselves are responsible for raising a person’s cancer risk. Several experts also cautioned that it’s not always easy to tell how much alcohol a drink contains. Dr. Kenneth Nahum, an oncologist at Hackensack Meridian Jersey Shore University Medical Center, said that spiked seltzers and teas in particular — which have become popular among young people — might be deceiving in terms of alcohol content. “They’re drinking it like it’s a soft drink,” he said. “They don’t even realize they’re drinking that much.” Gilbert said it’s unlikely that people will immediately change their drinking habits after Friday’s report, but he noted that it could eventually lead to changes in how people perceive their risk. “This advisory is a good step in the direction of just getting the word out so everybody can be better informed and make the best choice for themselves,” he said. Already, adults under 35 have become less likely to drink alcohol than that group was decades ago, according to a 2023 analysis. However, drinking has increased among those ages 55 and older. Experts suggested that young adults may be socializing in person less than earlier generations, or might simply prefer other substances. “Some are drinking less, and that might be because vaping and edibles are more available,” said Elizabeth Kovacs, a professor of surgery at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.

It's the first bird flu death in the US. Public health risk remains low, officials report.","Morgan McFall-Johnsen,Jessica Orwig",2025-01-06T23:47:02.000Z,"A 65-year-old patient has died of bird flu, Louisiana officials reported on Monday. The patient had underlying conditions and was likely infected by exposure to birds. This is the first death linked to the current outbreak of H5N1, avian influenza. Bird flu has claimed its first human death in the US. A Louisiana patient died from a severe case of the H5N1 avian influenza, state health officials reported on Monday. The patient, who was over 65 and had underlying conditions, is the only human case of H5N1 in Louisiana. There is still no sign that the H5N1 virus can spread between people. The Louisiana patient contracted the virus after exposure to wild birds and a non-commercial backyard flock, officials reported. The bird flu's proliferation through bird and animal populations worldwide has led to many human spillover cases over the years. There have been 939 cases of human H5N1 infections worldwide as of November 2024, according to the World Health Organization. Of those, 464 were fatal. ""I think it's pretty clear that we will continue to see severe disease,"" Richard Webby, a virologist at St. Jude and director of the WHO animal and bird flu center, told Business Insider. ""I guess the real question is are we going to see more? I don't know the answer to that one."" The Louisiana patient, who was hospitalized in late 2024, carried a new version of bird flu, which is unlike the bird flu that has been spreading in cattle across the US, the CDC reported. A teenager in Canada, who was hospitalized with severe bird flu in November, also carried that new version, which is called the D1.1 genotype. Public-health experts are concerned that H5N1 could develop mutations that allow it to adapt better to infecting mammals. That could set the virus on a path to human-to-human transmission. Webby said samples of the D1.1 genotype virus ""did look like they were starting to develop some of those mutations"" after infecting the Louisiana and Canada patients. Fortunately, the mutated virus did not appear to pass from those two patients to other people. ""To be honest, the last month, six weeks, have made me a little more uneasy about the situation,"" Webby said. The Louisiana Department of Health said in its report that the public health risk for the general public remains low, but ""people who work with birds, poultry or cows, or have recreational exposure to them, are at higher risk."" Still, Webby said the Louisiana case shows that ""the risk of catching this virus is not just for those that are in a milking parlor in California,"" who are some of the most at-risk due to the widespread outbreak in the state's cattle. Rather, he said, ""anywhere where there's birds, there is a risk to individuals who are in contact with those birds.""

When Michael Adams was researching health insurance options in 2023, he had one very specific requirement: coverage for prosthetic limbs. Adams, 51, lost his right leg to cancer 40 years ago, and he has worn out more legs than he can count. He picked a gold plan on the Colorado health insurance marketplace that covered prosthetics, including microprocessor-controlled knees like the one he has used for many years. That function adds stability and helps prevent falls. But when his leg needed replacing last January after about five years of everyday use, his new marketplace health plan wouldn't authorize it. The roughly $50,000 leg with the electronically controlled knee wasn't medically necessary, the insurer said, even though Colorado law leaves that determination up to the patient's doctor, and his has prescribed a version of that leg for many years, starting when he had employer-sponsored coverage. MORE: In Vermont, where almost everyone has insurance, many can't find or afford care ""The electronic prosthetic knee is life-changing,"" said Adams, who lives in Lafayette, Colorado, with his wife and two kids. Without it, ""it would be like going back to having a wooden leg like I did when I was a kid."" The microprocessor in the knee responds to different surfaces and inclines, stiffening up if it detects movement that indicates its user is falling. People who need surgery to replace a joint typically don't encounter similar coverage roadblocks. In 2021, 1.5 million knee or hip joint replacements were performed in United States hospitals and hospital-owned ambulatory facilities, according to the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ. The median price for a total hip or knee replacement without complications at top orthopedic hospitals was just over $68,000 in 2020, according to one analysis, though health plans often negotiate lower rates. To people in the amputee community, the coverage disparity amounts to discrimination. ""Insurance covers a knee replacement if it's covered with skin, but if it's covered with plastic, it's not going to cover it,"" said Jeffrey Cain, a family physician and former chair of the board of the Amputee Coalition, an advocacy group. Cain wears two prosthetic legs, having lost his after an airplane accident nearly 30 years ago. AHIP, a trade group for health plans, said health plans generally provide coverage when the prosthetic is determined to be medically necessary, such as to replace a body part or function for walking and day-to-day activity. In practice, though, prosthetic coverage by private health plans varies tremendously, said Ashlie White, chief strategy and programs officer at the Amputee Coalition. Even though coverage for basic prostheses may be included in a plan, ""often insurance companies will put caps on the devices and restrictions on the types of devices approved,"" White said. An estimated 2.3 million people are living with limb loss in the U.S., according to an analysis by Avalere, a health care consulting company. That number is expected to as much as double in coming years as people age and a growing number lose limbs to diabetes, trauma, and other medical problems. Fewer than half of people with limb loss have been prescribed a prosthesis, according to a report by the AHRQ. Plans may deny coverage for prosthetic limbs by claiming they aren't medically necessary or are experimental devices, even though microprocessor-controlled knees like Adams' have been in use for decades. Cain was instrumental in getting passed a 2000 Colorado law that requires insurers to cover prosthetic arms and legs at parity with Medicare, which requires coverage with a 20% coinsurance payment. Since that measure was enacted, about half of states have passed ""insurance fairness"" laws that require prosthetic coverage on par with other covered medical services in a plan or laws that require coverage of prostheses that enable people to do sports. But these laws apply only to plans regulated by the state. Over half of people with private coverage are in plans not governed by state law. The Medicare program's 80% coverage of prosthetic limbs mirrors its coverage for other services. Still, an October report by the Government Accountability Office found that only 30% of beneficiaries who lost a limb in 2016 received a prosthesis in the following three years. MORE: Americans are unhappy with the state of health care and insurance Cost is a factor for many people. ""No matter your coverage, most people have to pay something on that device,"" White said. As a result, ""many people will be on a payment plan for their device,"" she said. Some may take out loans. The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has proposed a rule that would prohibit lenders from repossessing medical devices such as wheelchairs and prosthetic limbs if people can't repay their loans. ""It is a replacement limb,"" said White, whose organization has heard of several cases in which lenders have repossessed wheelchairs or prostheses. Repossession is ""literally a punishment to the individual."" Adams ultimately owed a coinsurance payment of about $4,000 for his new leg, which reflected his portion of the insurer's negotiated rate for the knee and foot portion of the leg but did not include the costly part that fits around his stump, which didn't need replacing. The insurer approved the prosthetic leg on appeal, claiming it had made an administrative error, Adams said. ""We're fortunate that we're able to afford that 20%,"" said Adams, who is a self-employed leadership consultant. Leah Kaplan doesn't have that financial flexibility. Born without a left hand, she did not have a prosthetic limb until a few years ago. Growing up, ""I didn't want more reasons to be stared at,"" said Kaplan, 32, of her decision not to use a prosthesis. A few years ago, the cycling enthusiast got a prosthetic hand specially designed for use with her bike. That device was covered under the health plan she has through her county government job in Spokane, Washington, helping developmentally disabled people transition from school to work. But when she tried to get approval for a prosthetic hand to use for everyday activities, her health plan turned her down. The myoelectric hand she requested would respond to electrical impulses in her arm that would move the hand to perform certain actions. Without insurance coverage, the hand would cost her just over $46,000, which she said she can't afford. Working with her doctor, she has appealed the decision to her insurer and been denied three times. Kaplan said she's still not sure exactly what the rationale is, except that the insurer has questioned the medical necessity of the prosthetic hand. The next step is to file an appeal with an independent review organization certified by the state insurance commissioner's office. A prosthetic hand is not a luxury device, Kaplan said. The prosthetic clinic has ordered the hand and made the customized socket that will fit around the end of her arm. But until insurance coverage is sorted out, she can't use it. At this point she feels defeated. ""I've been waiting for this for so long,"" Kaplan said.

The patient remains the only human case of bird flu confirmed in Louisiana. The U.S. has seen an increase in human cases of bird flu, or avian influenza, since April, when the first human case was reported. As of Jan. 3, there have been 66 human cases of bird flu reported in the U.S., according to CDC data. Signs and symptoms of infection in humans often include sore throat, cough, fever, runny or stuffy nose, headache, muscle or body aches, fatigue and shortness of breath, the CDC says. Less common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and seizures. Infections can range from no symptoms or mild illness, such as flu-like symptoms, to more severe illness, such as pneumonia that could require hospitalizations, the CDC says. Almost all confirmed cases have had direct contact with infected cattle or infected livestock. Aside from the case confirmed in the Louisiana patient, cases have been mild, and patients had all recovered after receiving antiviral medication, according to the CDC and state health officials. One previous case in Missouri was hospitalized, but health officials pointed to other health conditions aside from bird flu infection involved in the patient's admission to the hospital.

State health officials announced the death on Monday, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed it was the nation's first due to bird flu. Health officials have said the person was older than 65, had underlying medical problems and had been in contact with sick and dead birds in a backyard flock. They also said a genetic analysis had suggested the bird flu virus had mutated inside the patient, which could have led to the more severe illness. Few other details about the person have been disclosed. Since March, 66 confirmed bird flu infections have been reported in the U.S., but previous illnesses have been mild and most have been detected among farmworkers exposed to sick poultry or dairy cows. A bird flu death was not unexpected, virus experts said. There have been more than 950 confirmed bird flu infections globally since 2003, and more than 460 of those people died, according to the World Health Organization. The bird flu virus ""is a serious threat and it has historically been a deadly virus,"" said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at the Brown University School of Public Health. “This is just a tragic reminder of that.” Nuzzo noted a Canadian teen became severely ill after being infected recently. Researchers are still trying to gauge the dangers of the current version of the virus and determine what causes it to hit some people harder than others, she said. “Just because we have seen mild cases does not mean future cases will continue to be mild,” she added. In a statement, CDC officials described the Louisiana death as tragic but also said “there are no concerning virologic changes actively spreading in wild birds, poultry or cows that would raise the risk to human health.” In two of the recent U.S. cases — an adult in Missouri and a child in California — health officials have not determined how they caught the virus. The origin of the Louisiana person's infection was not considered a mystery. But it was the first human case in the U.S. linked to exposure to backyard birds, according to the CDC. Louisiana officials say they are not aware of any other cases in their state, and U.S. officials have said they do not have any evidence that the virus is spreading from person to person. The H5N1 bird flu has been spreading widely among wild birds, poultry, cows and other animals. Its growing presence in the environment increases the chances that people will be exposed, and potentially catch it, officials have said. Officials continue to urge people who have contact with sick or dead birds to take precautions, including wearing respiratory and eye protection and gloves when handling poultry. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Part of an effort to reduce exposure to a toxic metal that causes developmental and neurological issues in children, the action announced on Monday offers only voluntary — not mandatory — limits for food manufacturers. But the agency can take enforcement action if it finds foods that surpass its recommended limits. The FDA guidance caps lead levels for children younger than 2 at 10 parts per billion for fruits, most vegetables, grain and meat mixtures, yogurts, custards and puddings, and single-ingredient meats. It sets a limit of 20 parts per billion for single-ingredient root vegetables and for dry infant cereals. The directive covers packaged processed foods sold in jars, pouches, tubs or boxes. By contrast, the new limits don't cover grain-based snacks like puffs and teething biscuits, despite some research indicating the products have higher levels of lead. It also doesn't limit other metals like cadmium that have been found in baby foods. ""FDA's actions today are a step forward and will help protect children,"" said Thomas Galligan, a scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest. ""However, the agency took too long to act and ignored important public input that could have strengthened these standards."" Between October 2023 and April 2024, more than 560 children fell ill after consuming lead-tainted apple cinnamon puree, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The amount of lead detected in those products were more than 2,000 times higher than the FDA's maximum allowable limit. Exposure to lead in utero, infancy and early childhood can lead to harmful neurological effects like learning and behavior disabilities and lowered IQ.

The patient, the first in the U.S. to die from bird flu, also known as H5N1, was over 65 and reported to have underlying medical conditions. The person became ill after contact with a combination of a backyard flock and wild birds, the health department said in a news release. The department declined to release any more information about the patient to protect their privacy. No one else appears to have been infected with bird flu, either from birds or from the sick patient, in Louisiana, the department said. While the current public health risk for the general public remains low, people who work with birds, poultry or cows, or have recreational exposure to them, are at higher risk. To avoid exposure, avoid direct contact with wild birds and other potentially infected animals. Bird flu has been traveling around the world since 1997. It was largely confined to wild birds until recent years. It has infected more than 60 people in the U.S. this year, though most have had mild disease, typically the red eyes of conjunctivitis. The Louisiana patient was the first to suffer severe disease, likely because of their age and other health conditions. The patient was also infected with a flu strain from wild birds, not the one circulating in dairy cows and most poultry farms, officials said last month. It's not clear if that strain is more dangerous or if the route of transmission made the infection more serious. Most of the others were farm workers, who were likely infected when they touched their eyes after touching infected animals. Around the world, bird flu has killed about half of the people known to have been infected. If you believe you may have been exposed to bird flu either from wild birds or infected livestock, be on the lookout for respiratory symptoms or the red eyes charactistic of conjunctivitis, the Louisiana Department of Public Health advises. If you develop these symptoms within 10 days, call your healthcare provider to say that you have been in contact with sick animals and are worried you might have bird flu. This will help them provide advice on testing and treatment. Stay home and away from others while you have symptoms. The Louisiana Department of Public Health recommends the following: Do not touch sick or dead animals or their droppings and do not bring sick wild animals into your home. Keep your pets away from sick or dead animals and their feces. Do not eat uncooked or undercooked food. Cook poultry, eggs and other animal products to the proper temperature and prevent cross-contamination between raw and cooked food. Avoid uncooked food products such as unpasteurized raw milk or cheeses from animals that have a suspected or confirmed infection. If you work on poultry or dairy farms, talk to your provider about getting your seasonal flu vaccination. It will not prevent infection with avian influenza viruses, but it can reduce the risk of coinfection with avian and flu viruses.

Federal and state officials have said the risk to the general public remains low. The ongoing bird flu outbreak, which began in poultry in 2022, has killed nearly 130 million wild and domestic poultry and has sickened 917 dairy herds, according to the CDC and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. An analysis of the virus taken from the Louisiana patient showed it belongs to the D1.1 genotype - the same type that has recently been detected in wild birds and poultry in Washington State, as well as a recent severe case in a teen in British Columbia, Canada, according to the CDC. It is different from the B3.13 genotype currently circulating in U.S. dairy cows, which has mostly been associated with mild symptoms in human cases including conjunctivitis, or pink eye. The CDC said the risk to the general public remains low. Experts have been looking for signs that the virus is acquiring the ability to spread easily from person to person, but the CDC said there is no evidence of that. People who work with birds, poultry, cows, or have recreational exposure to them, are at higher risk, Louisiana health officials said in a statement. Worldwide, more than 950 human cases of bird flu have been reported to the World Health Organization, and about half have resulted in death.

Here's what you need to know about HMPV, including what it is, how it spreads and how to treat it. HMPV is a virus that can cause upper and lower respiratory disease, according to the CDC. It was discovered in 2001 and is in the Pneumoviridae family along with respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, the CDC said. Over the years, there has been a better understanding and awareness of HMPV, which has led to broader testing, according to the federal health agency. ""Human metapneumovirus is another one of those respiratory viruses that we're now appreciating more because we have the diagnostic capability to actually diagnose it more readily in hospitals, emergency rooms and even in physicians' offices,"" Schaffner said. ""Now we have diagnostic panels that can tell you whether you have influenza or COVID or RSV or human metapneumovirus."" HMPV has an incubation period of three to six days, according to the CDC. Symptoms include cough, nasal congestion, fever and shortness of breath, the federal health agency said. ""It's oftentimes indistinguishable from the other respiratory viruses, because we don't usually check for it unless somebody is really ill,"" Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a professor of medicine and an infectious diseases specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, told ABC News. Young children and adults aged 65 and older are among those at the highest risk of HMPV progressing to bronchitis or pneumonia. MORE: Some hospitals seeing increase in RSV, 'walking pneumonia.' Here's what to know HMPV can spread through secretions from coughing and sneezing, close personal contact and touching objects that have the virus and then touching the eyes, nose or mouth, according to the CDC. In the U.S., like other respiratory viruses, HMPV cases typically rise in the winter and decrease in the spring. Chin-Hong said most people are exposed to HMPV by the time they're five years old. People can get reinfected, but symptoms are typically milder. Those who are immunocompromised or are older may experience more severe symptoms if they are reinfected. There are no antivirals to treat HMPV, so treatment consists of providing supportive care to patients with moderate or severe symptoms, the experts said. ""If you're wheezing, we'll give bronchodilators,"" Chin-Hong said, referencing a medication that relaxes and opens the airways and helps clear mucus from the lungs. ""If you're dehydrated, we give fluid; we reduce the fever."" Chin-Hong said that because people may develop co-infections, including bacterial infections, antibiotics may need to be given. There is no vaccine to prevent HMPV, so prevention includes following basic hygiene including washing hands with soap and water, covering the nose and mouth when coughing and sneezing and staying home when sick. ""People who are in this high-risk group for any of these viruses -- particularly older people, people who are frail, people who are immune-compromised -- if they go indoors where there are a lot of people, [they should] put their mask back on and also consider social distancing,"" Schaffner said. MORE: Despite 'game-changing' new RSV shots, uptake lagged among infants, adults: Experts Chin-Hong and Schaffner added that it's important for people to receive vaccines for other respiratory illnesses including COVID-19, flu and RSV. Getting vaccinated against other respiratory viruses can reduce the risk of co-infection and may help health care professionals rule out certain illnesses much sooner. ""Sure, you can get serious disease from HMPV itself, but if you get HMPV plus pneumococcus or HMPV plus influenza or RSV, it could be much worse,"" Chim-Hong said. ""During respiratory virus season, you want to minimize the probability of co-infection.""

I'm Dana Taylor. Today is Wednesday, December 11th, 2024, and this is a special episode of The Excerpt. Approximately 800,000 knee replacement surgeries are performed each year in the US, first pioneered back in 1968. It was a medical breakthrough for patients who were living with chronic pain and were unable to do their normal activities. But having a total knee replacement is also an invasive procedure, often involving a several days long stay in the hospital, followed by six months to a year of physical therapy. But what if there's another road to knee recovery, a less invasive one with a faster route to getting back to doing the things you love? CartiHeal implants made from coral exoskeletons may just be the magic bullet for thousands whose knees are only partially damaged. Joining us now to discuss these new treatment options is Dr. Cassandra Lee, an orthopedic surgeon and sports medicine specialist at UC Davis. Thanks for joining me, Dr. Lee. Dr. Cassandra Lee: Thank you for having me. Dana Taylor: Tell me about this CartiHeal or coral implant. What is it really, and how does it work? Dr. Cassandra Lee: I think for you to really understand how the CartiHeal implant works is, let's go back to what arthritis and cartilage is. So articular cartilage is that white pearly stuff that covers the end of your bones. It's what allows our joints to move very smoothly and allows us to jump, run, do anything active that we want to do. What can happen over time is that we can start getting little cracks and little fissures and then little potholes within that cartilage, and then it starts wearing down and eventually as you wear down, it can then become bone on bone arthritis, what you alluded to with knee replacements. Cartilage is an interesting tissue in that it cannot heal itself. It cannot regrow itself. So all the technologies we're trying to work with are trying to signal the body to see how well can we take the cells that we have in our bodies and try to regrow cartilage. Not perfect cartilage, but some kind of scar cartilage so that we can get back to being active for longer. So what the CartiHeal implant does is that it is a piece of coral, it's made out of calcium aragonite. That's the technical stuff that's in there. And what it can do is we put it into the bone within the knee joint and it can heal the bone, which is part of your knee joint. There's little holes on top that all those healing cells that are in your bone marrow can trickle up into that CartiHeal implant and then come up and then turn into a more cartilage type tissue. So it can heal that bone and cartilage and help regrow something that allows you to stay active for longer. Dana Taylor: Is this new coral treatment option expensive to produce? What does accessibility look like for patients from a cost perspective? Dr. Cassandra Lee: So this is something that is covered by your insurance. So like any type of surgical procedure when we take someone to surgery, we do work with insurance to get authorization, and then I think out-of-pocket expenses depended upon your insurance policy. It is available in the U.S. The clinical trial was several years ago. So I think over time... It's been FDA approved for a few years now. So it is something that is readily accessible and available throughout the United States. Dana Taylor: Dr. Lee, why not skip the cartilage replacement and just use the coral implants? Wouldn't that be an even faster road to recovery Dr. Cassandra Lee: If it were that easy, right? So cartilage replacement is not as easy as it sounds on paper. We have a lot of different technologies that we try to regrow cartilage and keep our patients active for longer. So if you think of a road, so if you have a small crack or a small pothole, those are something that we can kind of manage with just like a little spackling if you will. There isn't a version of that with cartilage replacement or regeneration, but then now imagine that pothole gets deeper and deeper so you get past the asphalt down into the dirt. And so there's a whole spectrum of how we look at cartilage defects into arthritis. And CartiHeal is just one of those many tricks or tools in our bag that we can help treat our patients. We have anything from cell-based therapies where we can actually take cartilage from you, your own tissue, we can grow it in a lab and then we can implant that into your joint and then help you grow new cartilage. So that's something like for smaller pothole, if you will. And then now imagine the pothole gets a little bit bigger and a little bit deeper and the road's a little bit more cracked up. So that's where you have a little more arthritis, and that's where something like CartiHeal implant would be more effective in that it has a little bit more area to heal. And then finally when you get to the point where you're just down to the dirt road, that's when you're on bone-on-bone arthritis and unfortunately we just don't have anything to fix that outside of a knee replacement. Dana Taylor: So we've focused on knee replacement specifically, but do the treatment options that you've described offer of new hope to those in need of something like a hip replacement as well, how else might this CartiHeal material or the others be used? Dr. Cassandra Lee: I think that's what the exciting thing is. I think knee arthritis is so common, but arthritis is everywhere in your body and millions of people around the world are affected by it. The knee is something that's the most studied, but certainly we're taking these technologies and apply it to the ankle, to the hip and even to the shoulder. But as of right now, at least in the United States, the FDA has approved a type of matrix like CartiHeal for the knee. We have also that cell-based therapy that is approved by our FDA for the knee. I know there's probably studies ongoing around the world looking at other parts. There are even mechanical implants, like metal implants that we can do that are like shock absorbers that is not quite a knee replacement, that is also FDA approved in this country. Dana Taylor: As a surgeon, can you tell us how cartilage replacement therapy with or without coral implants compare to a total knee replacement? Why would a doctor recommend one over the other? Dr. Cassandra Lee: So it depends on your philosophy of how to look at the knee joint. I think a lot of times we think about knee joint preservation, trying to keep the mechanics that are already there, how your knee feels to you, how your knee responds to you. When we do a total knee replacement, we are in effect resurfacing or cutting out the ends of those bones and recreating that shape with that end of the femur, end of the tibia, and then a plastic insert to be like the cartilage and meniscus. And it just doesn't act like your knee. It should take away pain. That is a great procedure for pain, but it doesn't quite perform the same way as your old knee. So I think as long as the knee joint isn't too far gone, if we're not talking about bone-on-bone and you're young, you're active. And young, that number is... I'm not saying 30, 40, I'm saying 50, 60, maybe even the 70s. I have plenty of patients coming in who are more active than I am. So if you're a young active patient and your joint isn't what we call end stage bone-on-bone, I think it's not unreasonable to go ahead and try to do a joint preservation technique so that we can keep you active for longer with a knee that feels like yours. Dana Taylor: When we look at all types of synthetic cartilage, has there been research on the long-term effects on the body overall, the joint and its surrounding tissue? Dr. Cassandra Lee: When you're saying synthetic, I'd like to say your natural tissue versus there's actually things that are being developed that is artificial cartilage. So that's an exciting field. So many people around the world are working on this articular cartilage problem. And so we have different perspectives and different approaches, right? Anything from cell-based of your own cells to even donor cells, something we called an allograft or we're talking about matrices, which are kind of like scaffolds, like this CartiHeal that we're trying to put into the bone and utilize your own body's cells to come up, like the bone marrow cells to come up and make new cartilage. And then even the last part of it is a truly artificial man-made plastic or some kind of biomaterial. So there are so many different approaches to this, and I would say cell-based therapies. So using your own tissue has been in use since the late '90s. So there's a lot of data on that. Scaffolds, depending on what you're looking at, there are some 10-year data outcomes depending on how old this technology is. We have good data for maybe 10 to 20 years, maybe up to 30. But some of the newer things that are being developed like that truly artificial plastic cartilage, it's just coming to first-in-human trials in the U.S. We're not quite there to give you more than two-year outcome right now. For things to become FDA-approved in this country, it has to go through first-in-human trials saying, is it safe? The second one is, does... The phase II trials or something where does your body reject it or you follow it for a certain amount of time? And then phase III trials go towards comparing it against what's already in practice to say, does it work? There is a lot of legwork, if you will, to show that these technologies are safe. That being said, have there been things that we've taken off the market because even though it's gone through these trials, something happened as we put them in more patients? Yes, there have been small things here and there that have happened that way. But in general, I think this is why we have an FDA, to make sure that things are safe for our patients and everyone around us. Dana Taylor: So how far off are we from stem cell therapy negating the need for joint replacements? Is the research there that promising? Dr. Cassandra Lee: Everything is promising. We're just not there yet, right? We're not at that Star Trek, inject something or wave something over your leg and then all of a sudden you have a great knee. I think stem cells are tricky because we're not talking about the same cells. And I think that's a big argument between where we are in scientific world and in the lay public. I'd love to say that there's one cell in your body that I can be like, ""Hey, turn into bone, turn into cartilage, do your job."" But we're not there yet. We can do that in a Petri dish. There's certain cell types that we're going to call multi-potential or pluripotential, meaning it has the ability to turn into a lot of tissues, but we don't have that one magic cell that turns into everything. There's a lot of room to learn about this and we're just not quite there yet. Dana Taylor: Are high impact sports and activities the primary cause of damage or loss of cartilage? Are there preventative measures that pro athletes take to protect their cartilage that the rest of us can also do? Dr. Cassandra Lee: There is prevention, but part of how arthritis comes about is yes, past trauma. So if you do something high impact, or unfortunately if you hurt that knee in that high school football game, that does come back and kind of haunt you a little bit down the road. But there's also genetic component, right? So if you look at your family members, and a lot of them had knee replacements early on, unfortunately that is a cartilage you have. But that's not something you can change, right? So what can you change? Cartilage likes to be loaded, but the question is how much? So we do want people being active. We want them doing weight-bearing exercises. We do want them doing cardiovascular exercises because that's good for your heart and lungs too. And then we also want you to be strong, balanced, and flexible. So everything is, we want you to stay active, be strong that your muscles can support the knee joints, and then also be flexible enough that you're not loading your knee, maybe crooked or something like that. So everything is maintenance and balance. Dana Taylor: The loss of cartilage can make mobility challenging. A lack of mobility then can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, which also poses health risks. What can you share with us about the health challenges that may be exacerbated by a loss of cartilage? Dr. Cassandra Lee: Yeah, that is a difficult problem, right? So the idea is that if you have breakdown of your cartilage, that leads to arthritis. And then what patients feel is anything from stiffness to swelling, to pain, to loss of emotion, all these don't make you get off the couch and go run, right? It hurts. So my analogy that I think about when I talk to patients is that think about an older piece of machinery. I'm not calling this old, but think about something that's been worn, has a little bit of rust. The more you use it, the more you put maintenance into it, the better and longer it can run, right? So there comes an age when we do have to put maintenance in. We do have to do strengthening exercises, we do have to do motion, and it doesn't have to be a high impact. It just has to be moving. So stationary bike, walking, elliptical, getting in the pool, taking away weight off of it. And then flexibility is going to be important because if it's too stiff, it's hard to move in that full range of motion, and then things get a little bit more stiff, if you will. And then balance. Balance is also an important part of it because you want to be able to load things evenly. So when we're talking about exercise, I'm not telling you to go run a marathon, I'm telling you to stay mobile. You can be on a stationary bike, do stretching and strengthening. So something like yoga, Pilates, anything where you're working on your flexibility and balance is all important in maintaining the joint and maintaining your overall health when you have osteoarthritis. Dana Taylor: Are there any ethical considerations here for pro athletes? I'd love to see Michael Jordan come out of retirement who we all feel good is new with this new therapy or others such as stem cell therapy. Dr. Cassandra Lee: Wow, that's a really tough question. So I want to caution against some of these technologies that we do have. We can try to slow the progression of arthritis, but we're not stopping the natural [inaudible 00:13:47]. We can't put something in there right now and regrow brand new articular cartilage that you had when you were two years old, we're just not there yet. Certainly that that is the holy grail, and that's what we want to strive for when we regenerate cartilage. But for now, a lot of this is maintenance on the patient's part in terms of what you can do from a nutrition and exercise standpoint. But also if this is hindering you and you have these isolated cartilage defects, but not severe bone-on-bone arthritis, we can try to intervene to try to slow down the progression. But the progression is inevitable. Right now with where our technologies are at, you will be looking at knee replacement. The hope is that we can slow that down and push that down the road.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/too-many-transgender-kids-given-193253163.html,Some say too many transgender kids are given hormones. Data finds otherwise.,,Health,USA TODAY,3 min read,A new study found less than .1% of transgender and gender-diverse teens are prescribed puberty blockers or gender-affirming hormones.,"Adrianna Rodriguez, USA TODAY",2025-01-06T19:32:53.000Z,"Despite public uproar over teenagers and children changing their genders, transgender teenagers and children rarely get prescribed gender-affirming medications, according to a new study. Just .1% of children ages 8 to 17 who identify as transgender or gender-diverse were prescribed gender-affirming hormones or puberty blockers, according to a study by researchers at Harvard University and FOLX Health, a healthcare provider for the LGBTQ+ community. The report, published Monday in JAMA Pediatrics, looked at five million private insurance claims filed between 2018 and 2022. “The politicization of gender-affirming care for transgender youth has been driven by a narrative that millions of children are using hormones and that this type of care is too freely given. Our findings reveal that is not the case,” said the Harvard study’s lead author Landon Hughes, a postdoctoral fellow at the university’s school of public health. The findings also showed that no patients under 12 received gender-affirming hormones and higher rates of puberty blockers were prescribed for patients assigned female at birth, whom study authors note typically experience an earlier onset of puberty than patients assigned male at birth. Tennessee ban on transgender care: What does the science say? The years studied predate most of the effort to block health care for transgender youth in some states, said Dr. Joshua Safer, an endocrinologist and executive director of the Mount Sinai Center for Transgender Medicine and Surgery in New York. While the study may have missed some Medicaid patients or those who paid in cash, most patients would have gone through the private insurance system, he said. About 3.3% of U.S. high school students identify as transgender and an additional 2.2% have questioned if they were at some point, according to the latest annual Youth Risk Behavior Survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Puberty blockers, originally approved for children whose sexual development occurs too early, are prescribed to delay the onset of puberty or pause it in its tracks. These medications, called GnRH agonists, stop the body from making sex hormones, such as testosterone and estrogen. In people assigned male at birth, such treatment slows down the growth of facial and body hair, prevents voice deepening and limits the growth of sex organs, according to the Mayo Clinic. In people assigned female at birth, it limits breast development and stops menstruation. Experts say delaying puberty gives transgender patients more time to explore and integrate their identity before coming off the puberty blockers. When they do, they may proceed to gender-affirming hormone therapy or resume puberty of their sex assigned at birth. However, the rate at which these teens receive hormone therapy is ""surprisingly low,"" said the study's senior author Jae Corman, head of analytics and research at FOLX Health. ""Our study found that, overall, very few (transgender and gender-diverse) youth access gender-affirming care,"" he said. ""Among those that do, the timing of care aligns with the standards outlined by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, the Endocrine Society, and the American Academy of Pediatrics.” Adrianna Rodriguez can be reached at adrodriguez@usatoday.com.

https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/doctors-worry-iodine-deficiency-dietary-191842254.html,Doctors worry that iodine deficiency — a dietary problem from the past — is coming back,,Health,Associated Press,4 min read,"A century ago, iodine deficiency affected kids across large swaths of the country.  Although most people are still getting enough, researchers have increasingly been reporting low levels of iodine in pregnant women and other people, raising concerns about an impact on their newborns.  “This needs to be on people’s radar,” said Dr. Monica Serrano-Gonzalez, a Brown University doctor who treated the boy in 2021 in Providence, Rhode Island.  What is iodine?",MIKE STOBBE,2025-01-06T19:18:42.000Z,"NEW YORK (AP) — The 13-year-old boy came to the clinic with a rapidly ballooning neck. Doctors were puzzled. Testing ruled out their first suspicion. But further tests pinpointed what they — and the boy — had been missing: iodine. A century ago, iodine deficiency affected kids across large swaths of the country. It essentially disappeared after some food makers started adding it to table salt, bread and some other foods, in one of the great public health success stories of the 20th century. But today, people are getting less iodine because of changes in diet and food manufacturing. Although most people are still getting enough, researchers have increasingly been reporting low levels of iodine in pregnant women and other people, raising concerns about an impact on their newborns. And there is also a very small, but growing, number of reports of iodine deficiency in kids. “This needs to be on people’s radar,” said Dr. Monica Serrano-Gonzalez, a Brown University doctor who treated the boy in 2021 in Providence, Rhode Island. What is iodine? Iodine is a trace element found in seawater and in some soils — mostly in coastal areas. A French chemist accidentally discovered it in 1811 when an experiment with seaweed ash created a purple puff of vapor. The name iodine comes from a Greek word meaning violet-colored. Later that century, scientists began to understand that people need certain amounts of iodine to regulate their metabolism and stay healthy, and that it’s crucial in the development of brain function in children. One sign of insufficient iodine is a swelling of the neck, known as a goiter. The thyroid gland in the neck uses iodine to produce hormones that regulate the heart rate and other body functions. When there's not enough iodine, the thyroid gland enlarges as it goes into overdrive to make up for the lack of iodine. At the beginning of the 20th century, goiter was very common in children in certain inland parts of the United States, especially in a “goiter belt” that stretched from Appalachia and the Great Lakes to the northwest United States. Some of the kids were unusually short, deaf, intellectually stunted and had other symptoms of a syndrome once known as “cretinism.” Adding iodine to salt Public health experts realized they couldn't solve the problem by feeding everyone seaweed and seafood, but they learned that iodine can essentially be sprayed on table salt. Iodized salt first became available in 1924. By the 1950s, more than 70% of U.S. households used iodized table salt. Bread and some other foods also were fortified with iodine, and iodine deficiency became rare. But diets changed. Processed foods now make up a large part of the American diet, and though they contain a lot of salt, it's not iodized. Leading bread brands no longer add iodine. In the case of the 13-year-old boy, he has mild autism and was a fussy eater, mostly only eating specific brands of bread and peanut butter. And for people who do salt their food, the fashion now is to use kosher salt, Himalayan rock salt or other noniodized products. “People have forgotten why there's iodine in salt,” said Dr. Elizabeth Pearce of Boston Medical Center. She is a leader in the Iodine Global Network, a nongovernmental agency working to eliminate iodine deficiency disorders. She noted a reported 50% drop in U.S. iodine levels in surveyed Americans between the 1970s and the 1990s. How much iodine is enough? Though iodine consumption is falling overall, most Americans are still getting enough through their diet, experts say. But doctors worry that's not the case for women and children, who are most vulnerable to iodine deficiency. The American Academy of Pediatrics and other medical societies recommend that all pregnant and breastfeeding women get 150 micrograms of iodine each day. You can get that from one-half to three-quarters of a teaspoon of iodized table salt. In the last 15 years or so, U.S. researchers have increasingly reported seeing mild iodine deficiency in pregnant women. A Michigan State University study of about 460 pregnant women in the city of Lansing found about a quarter of them were not getting enough. Many prenatal vitamins don't contain iodine, noted Jean Kerver, the study's lead author. That's why doctors recommend that pregnant or breastfeeding women check labels to ensure they are taking multivitamins or prenatal supplements with iodine. Some studies have linked even mild iodine deficiency to lower IQs and language delay in children, although there is debate about at exactly what levels problems start, Pearce said. Experts say there hasn't been enough research to establish what impact that iodine deficiency has actually been having on the U.S. population in recent years. Serrano-Gonzalez said she and her colleagues have seen four other cases in children in their clinic in Providence. “We’re concerned this may be increasing, especially in patients with restricted diets,"" she said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

The former coach and current ESPN analyst said on New York radio on Monday that he would shut down the “country club” and keep Rodgers in line. Among other things, Ryan slammed both Rodgers and the Jets for his unexcused absence from the team’s mandatory minicamp last summer. ""Clearly, when you have a guy that doesn't show up for mandatory minicamp — and, by the way, he's your quarterback, coming off an injury — I think that's an absolutely ridiculous message you send to the team,"" Ryan said on the DiPietro & Rothenberg Show. ""If he comes back, things would be different. If he's back, it ain't gonna be the country club, show up whenever the hell you want to show up. That ain't gonna happen. I'll just leave it at that.” Rodgers is undecided on his future with the organization after leading the team to just a 5-12 record this season, essentially his first with the team after he injured his Achilles on just the fourth play of his debut with the team last year. He has reportedly been quietly pushing for another season in New York, though the Jets don’t seem as thrilled about that idea. The 41-year-old missed minicamp last June in order to take a trip to Egypt, which he called a scheduling mix-up. The team fined him for the absence, but didn’t seem to mind much in the grand scheme of things. It marked just the latest off-field incident that Rodgers has found himself in recent years. Rodgers threw for 3,897 yards with 28 touchdowns and 11 interceptions this season, his 20th in the league. He surpassed the 500-touchdown mark on Sunday, too, which made him one of just five quarterbacks in league history to do so. The Jets are currently interviewing candidates to replace Robert Saleh as their next head coach. Ryan said he will meet with the organization on Tuesday in South Florida. The team requested to interview former Miami Dolphins head coach and current Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores on Monday. The team also reportedly plans to interview Josh McCown, Joe Brady, Aaron Glenn, Brian Griese, Vance Joseph, Matt Nagy, Ron Rivera, Bobby Slowik, Arthur Smith and Mike Vrabel. While that’s a big field of candidates, Ryan is openly confident that he’s the man for the job. He spent six seasons leading the team from 2009-2014, where he compiled a 46-50 record. The 62-year-old led the team to the AFC championship game in back-to-back years during his run, which was the last time they reached the playoffs. He was fired by owner Woody Johnson in 2014. “The reason I think I'm going to get it is because I'm the best guy for it. It ain't close,” Ryan said, via ESPN. “The thing you have to do is, you have to connect with your football team, you have to connect with your fan base. The way they play, that's the most important thing. ""It's not just the X's and O's and all that. This [Lions offensive coordinator] Ben Johnson, I love him, I absolutely love him, but I'm a better candidate for this job than he would be.""",741,[],2025-01-07 01:19:10,2025-01-09 00:34:12

Sure, it may be a bit early to do so, with just over 220-ish days until the biggest draft weekend of the year. However, preparedness is never a bad thing. Nor is sparking some early debate on which of 2024's stars (or budding stars) are worthy of an early-round selection next season. Here's our team's first way-too-early (never too early!) 2025 two-round fantasy football mock draft. Chase is a peak-of-his-powers receiver coming off a triple crown season, tied to an elite passer. He certainly has the talent and situation necessary to repeat as WR1. — Andy Behrens Jefferson was hurt in 2023 and didn't play a full season. His other four years in the NFL: WR6, WR4, WR1, WR2. I still think it's important to get a roster of fantasy wideouts who start themselves.— Scott Pianowski I suppose I could scream into the void about the likelihood of the RB1 in any given season repeating their production. Or, I could just draft the guy who just rushed for 2,000-plus yards as the featured back for an upper-tier offense. — Behrens Robinson was just starting to spread his wings over the final six weeks (RB2 over that period) and the Falcons should have improved quarterback play — and thus, more offensive buoyancy — next season. — Pianowski Lamb just caught 101 passes for nearly 1,200 yards over just 15 games, in a season in which everything went wrong. We only have to look to his dominant 2023 to see his upside. — Behrens You get a little nervous if OC Ben Johnson leaves, but the Sun God and Jared Goff have a ton of reps together. St. Brown's average haul the last two seasons speaks for itself: 117-1,389-11. — Pianowski Everything about his season has been shockingly great and he'd already earned a profit on his ADP before David Montgomery's injury. With or without Ben Johnson in 2025, he's the clear RB3 on my board. — Behrens The touchdown column has been a little light, but if you prorate Nacua's 2024 pace to a full season, you get 122 catches and 1,530 yards. Sean McVay schemes are very good to their featured players. — Pianowski On a per-game and per-play basis, Collins has simply been sensational. He was averaging 88.0 YPG and 2.83 yards per route run entering Week 18. — Behrens Nabers just posted a 109-1,204-7 rookie season despite horrible play from his quarterback room. The Giants surely will have better options there next season. — Pianowski When picking at or near the end of the first round, you should feel fortunate to find anyone with a reasonable path to finishing as the game's No. 1 overall RB or WR. We don't need to speculate on whether McCaffrey can reach that level because he's done it twice before. — Behrens I didn't know how to break the Nabers-Thomas Jr. tie, so I'm thrilled my mock rosters landed both of them. The story is the same: dynamite rookie production despite poor quarterback play. At least Thomas' club is getting a new coaching staff. BTJ is always open. — Pianowski I can see no reason why Jacobs won't have exactly the same role and workload next season that he had in 2024, with the same level of effectiveness. He's been one of the league's most elusive high-volume backs since his first season, and the Packers have made him the centerpiece of their offense. — Behrens He rallied nicely after that fumble gaffe, didn't he? His final three weeks: RB1, RB1, RB5. Taylor quietly has 20 touchdowns in his last 24 games, and he's merely entering his age-26 season. — Pianowski Jeanty is a do-it-all running back and ludicrously skilled, coming off a cartoonish collegiate season. His ADP could settle higher than this if he lands in a competent offense. — Behrens His rushing efficiency came down, predictably, but he made up for it with an increased receiving role. The Miami offense is at a crossroads but Achene is the most stable thing in the room. Into Year 3, his arrow still points up. — Pianowski After a record setting first season, Bowers has solidly established himself as a resident of the top tier at his position. If a capable quarterback somehow finds his way to Vegas, Bowers has a shot at a legendary year. — Behrens The Buccaneers made him the featured back after the bye, and he was the RB6 over the final seven weeks. I know older backs did shockingly well in 2024, but this is still a position where I want to bet on youth, front-nine players. — Pianowski Under normal circumstances, I might be sweating the fact that he's entering his age-31 season. But he's also coming off a year in which he gained over 2,000 scrimmage yards and averaged a career-best 5.8 YPC. Henry remains an impossible problem and he's the featured runner in an upper-tier offense. — Behrens Are these the ""boring value vet"" years for Brown? He's averaged 85.8 receiving yards per game since joining the Eagles, and despite the Hurts and Barkley Show he still scored seven times on 67 catches this year. A presumed full season of Brown belongs in anyone's second round. — Pianowski",32,[],2025-01-07 01:19:10,2025-01-09 00:33:57
https://www.engadget.com/ai/watch-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-deliver-his-ces-2025-keynote-live-here-174947969.html,Watch NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang deliver his CES 2025 keynote live here,,Business,Engadget,2 min read,Tune in at 9:30PM ET on Monday to watch NVIDIA's CES press conference live.,john falcone,2025-01-07T00:50:36.000Z,"NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang had an absolutely spectacular 2024. Consider that the chip giant's stock price finished last year up 178 percent, and its market cap of more than $3.66 trillion dollars — with a T — is currently second only to Apple. That's thanks to the fact that the ongoing AI revolution is powered largely by NVIDIA processors, which is raking in billions on its hardware even as its customers stay firmly in the red. But that's why his task at CES 2025 in Las Vegas is daunting. He needs to outline a 2025 game plan that can somehow one-up the past 12 months. You can watch Jensen Huang's CES keynote as it happens right here, and catch Engadget's real-time live blog commentary as well. Huang will be taking the stage at the Mandalay Bay on Monday, January 8 at 9:30PM ET. Ahead of Huang's keynote, the Engadget team is also covering the Samsung and Sony CES 2025 press conferences in our liveblog. You can follow along below. In about 10 minutes at 5pm PT, Sony will be hosting its press conference, and this liveblog will be handed off to the safe, gentle and expert hands of our deputy editor Nate Ingraham. We expect Sony to talk about the same car it's talked about at CES for the last few years, and maybe surprise us with news from across its very diverse product portfolio that spans gaming, audio and home entertainment. Stick around, it'll be absolutely riveting, I'm sure. In case you missed it, Google also shared how it plans to integrate Gemini AI into its smart home platform, which encompasses devices like the Nest Audio, Nest Hub and Nest Cameras. Specifically, Gemini will be woven into the Assistant for those devices, so that speaking with the digital helper will feel more natural. Our reporter Amy Skorheim got a preview of what this will look like at Google's booth today, and here's her quick takeaway: ""Possibly the most impressive trick I saw was the case of the missing cookies. The rep asked the Nest Hub the question, ""Hey Google, what happened to the cookies on the counter?"" Pulling footage from a connected Nest Cam, the Hub displayed a dog walking into a kitchen, swiping a cookie and scampering off. The Assistant meanwhile narrated the context of the video saying, ""A dog jumped on the counter and looked at the cookies on December 12th at 1:29PM."" Of course, this was a pre-recorded clip, as there was sadly no dog in the demonstration kitchen."" Read more about Gemini AI on the Google Assistant in smart home products in our full story. Stern Pinball has been a mainstay of CES for years, as well as multiple other conventions across the industry, bringing a new themed machine each year. For CES 2025, the Engadget team was stoked to learn that the company's offering was a loving tribute to Dungeons and Dragons to celebrate the franchise's 50th birthday. This machine in particular focuses on Dungeons & Dragons: The Tyrant's Eye, and Nathan Ingraham explains what caught his eye: ""The thing that caught my eye was the fact that you can pick a character and level them up over time, provided you use Stern's Insider Connected app. That app already lets you create a profile and keep track of achievements, games in your area, your top scores and other features (you ""log in"" by scanning a QR code from the app). But with Dungeons & Dragons, you can actually improve your character over time and save your progress through the game's many modes. When you first start, you choose a character and location, and those choices will affect the goals you need to achieve. Stern specifically say that its new ""PinSave"" system will let you save character experience points, inventory items and game campaign progress across multiple games."" Read more about the Dungeons and Dragon Stern Pinball machine in our full story. We were already intrigued by the description of Roborock's CES 2025 offering, but seeing the video that Karissa Bell took really adds to the experience. The Saros Z70 robovac has a built-in arm that folds out and picks up items on your floor, and can even put them away. Will this save domestic relationships and keep people happy? Based on what Karissa saw, the robot arm at least seems to work, so you will just have to work on communication. Roborock's new robo vac can pick up your dirty socks. #CES2025 pic.twitter.com/6TumFV6OJD — Engadget (@engadget) January 6, 2025 Karissa adds: ""Before you can use it, you will have to activate the arm through the Roborock app, where you can also set what kind of objects it can interact with and where they should be placed. While not quite Rosey the Robot, Saros Z70 has the potential to make tidying up a lot easier. And it's not just a prototype — Roborock is planning to make it available for purchase this year."" Read more about the Roborock Saros Z70 robovac in our full story. It wouldn't be CES without celebrity-endorsed launches, and those of us who have covered this event for awhile are all too familiar with will.i.am's efforts to develop a successful tech product. Who can forget the PULS bracelet, which launched as smartwatch and wearable fever was just taking off? Anyway, will.i.am continues to make his presence known here at the conference, but this time via a collaboration with LG. In fact, right before CES 2025 began, the company appointed the musician as its ""Experiential Architect,"" working together on the xboom line of audio products. This week, Billy Steele got to check out the LG xboom in person, which includes a trio of speakers. The Grab is the smallest of these, and here's what Billy thought: ""I was pleasantly surprised by how much bass the xboom Grab mustered during my demo, with punchy highs and solid mids holding the details. That low-end tone seemed slightly muffled to me, but I only got a quick listen, so a full review would confirm if that's actually the case. The other surprising thing is how loud the xboom Grab can be. At only 50 percent volume, the compact unit produced an almost uncomfortable level of sound for the room."" Read more about the LG xboom speakers in our hands-on. By the way, there were things we saw at CES Unveiled last night that we might have wanted to try but avoided due to hygiene and personal comfort reasons. For example, a mass of people crowded around the booth of a company called Kirin, with a product called Salt Spoon that was supposed to use electricity to deliver the flavor of umami. It had disposable versions of its spoon ready for people to use, and though I waited in line multiple times to try it out, I never got to taste it. Based on what I heard from various people at the booth though, the salty flavor did seem to come through. I plan on hunting down Kirin this week to get myself some salty spoon time. While CES has been raging on, there has been some interesting news happening outside of Las Vegas too. For instance, Apple has announced that it plans to release an update ""in the coming weeks"" that will make it clearer that notification summaries are generated by AI. In case of future incidents where Apple Intelligence has misrepresented an alert by a news organization's app, for example, people will be able to see more easily that it was Apple Intelligence (as opposed to, say, the BBC) that crafts the sentences in those summaries. Now that Samsung is wrapped, next up on our list of notable press conferences today is Sony, which is taking place at 5PM PT (aka in about 2 hours, if I've done my math right). Of course, there are other companies with events in between, like Zeekr. CES is a great place to learn of companies you might not have heard of before. But not before he teed up the date of the upcoming Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2025 event by showing the details on a slide. It'll take place on January 22, 2025. We're getting a summary of how Samsung has discussed the assistance AI will provide in the home. And that's it, he offered best wishes and closed the press conference. JH Han is back, which means we're probably about done. We're getting a rundown on various competitions and youth programs that help develop life skills for the workforce and more. Samsung AI now knows how to separate the volume of dialog, but not background noise, when performing translations in real time. Settings will sync to new appliances, including your preferences for Bixby. Voice guides will be available for customers with low vision on appliances with touch screens later this year. VP of the corporate sustainability center Inhee Chung is now on stage. Accessibility is the next topic on the agenda. We're getting a rehash of the Harman automotive announcements from last year, as well as upcoming avatars that will serve as travel companions. SmartThings will also lend a hand with Hyundai EVs in the near future. It will help with everything from charging to locating your care in a full parking lot. SmartThings is even coming to ships, he says. Lots of response from the crowd on that one. Here's to you, Boaty McBoatface. From earlier, here's the details on Samsung's Galaxy Book Pro5 lineup that the company talked about onstage a few minutes ago. He's talking about all the ways the platform can use AI to manage multiple stores or entire hotels. A SmartThings Pro enterprise solution is up first. This is a review of previous announcements. Sean Michael from display product marketing is now on stage. I'm guessing AI on TVs is next? Ballie, Samsung's AI home companion that we've heard about for years, will finally be available in the first half for 2025. There's a new washer/dryer combo that's tinged with AI, if you're into consolidated appliances. There's a Generative Wallpaper feature too, that will use AI to make art for your TVs based on your cues. Samsung's Art Store is coming to more TVs as well, after debuting on The Frame. There's a click to search feature on Samsung TVs that will give you info on whoever is on screen. And the AI mode will automatically optimize the sound for your preferences or viewing environment. For instance, she could check in remotely with the Jet Bot vacuum and It's another ""here's how your week could be better optimized by AI"" story. Now Samsung's Alana Gomez-Solis from Samsung Corporate Comms is taking the stage. The AI could also monitor diet and nutrition, utilizing data from a Samsung connected Pak is noting that data from Galaxy Ring or Galaxy Watch can be used by Samsung's AI to better optimize sleeping conditions — such as by adjusting the thermostat. After the PC focus, Hon Pak, the SVP and of Digital Health Team has taken the stage. Galaxy Book5 360 and Galaxy Book5 Pro are the latest AI PCs from Samsung, and you can read our coverage here. Home insight will give you a picture of your energy use from SmartThings devices, with the goal of helping you lower your electricity bill. Speaker recognition powered by Bixby will adapt to which family member is asking for things, and the system will know which devices to employ to complete the requests. We're back to Home AI, powered by SmartThings devices. Samsung wants all of your devices to work together though One UI, which first debuted on mobile devices. Now, the platform works across TVs and appliances. Edge AI will collect data from your connected devices, but keeps it on your local network, he explains. Data can only be encrypted and decrypted on the user's device, so only users can see it, according to Gabrio. Knox Vault will expand to home appliances, moving beyond mobile devices and TVs. Once again, Samsung is telling us how safe and secure your data will be in regards to its AI tech. Starting to sense a theme... Head of connected experiences Jonathan Gabrio is up next. According to Han, Samsung's AI journey will continue for the next century. Seems ambitious! Samsung is working on Home AI to help you save time and keep your home safe. Han says it will also offer recommendations and understand your needs, and ""infuse more comfort and joy in your life."" Rival chip giants Intel, Qualcomm and AMD have already had their bite at the CES apple, and now it's NVIDIA's turn. For 2025, look for the inevitable sequels, with rumors suggesting a blazing fast RTX 5090 for starters. Of course, Wall Street will be more focused on the details Huang will undoubtedly share on the status of NVIDIA's AI hardware. We're likely to hear more news on the company's Blackwell AI chips, which should begin shipping in greater volume this year after first entering the market in late 2024.

By the time Sophie Grégoire Trudeau sat down to write her book Closer Together: Knowing Ourselves, Loving Each Other, she had already done quite a bit of work on her own emotional well-being. “Years ago when I was suffering from anxiety and eating disorders, it was only the tip of the iceberg of what was going on,” she tells Yahoo Canada. “It was really about a lack of self-esteem and a need to be nourished. I dealt with my pain through food but when I decided to heal, I changed my life path.” As Grégoire Trudeau sits before me — wearing a cheerful print blouse that matches her sunny disposition — I sense that she’s someone who wears her heart on her sleeve. She also looks like someone, who, when she decides to do something, goes all in. “I’m a Taurus so I’m all about fire,” she informs me with a laugh. For two decades, Grégoire Trudeau has fuelled that passion into mental health advocacy — something she was known for long before she became the unofficial “First Lady” of Canada in 2015, when her husband (now separated), Justin Trudeau, became Prime Minister. “Mental health is much more than a cause — it is a reality,” she tells me. “It’s also a common denominator. I’ve met enough people over the years with high titles—or no titles at all—to know that these are just an illusion. It’s a construct, and it’s empty. Deep down, it doesn’t serve us. Mental health reminds us that we are all just one trauma away from each other.” The new book drives home this point more than once. “The homeless person you pass on the street, for example? That could be you or me after trauma,” she writes. “It takes just a single dramatic life event or a series of smaller traumas to affect our nervous system and brain. This is our shared truth.” Grégoire Trudeau uses her own truth and personal experience as a launching pad for a collective conversation in the book about mental health, self-knowledge and empowerment. She interviews thought leaders such as physician and addiction expert Dr. Gabor Maté, psychologist and writer Harville Hendrix, as well as people from all walks of life who have shared their own life-changing experiences, like Governor General Mary Simon, singer-songwriters Jewel and Chantal Kreviazuk, as well as Corporate Director and transgender advocate Katie Dudtschak, to name a few. “It was a labour of love and a team effort,” she emphasizes. “The lessons are so deep,” she says. “It was a journey of discovery.” The book is also an amalgamation of what Grégoire has been through herself, coupled with the knowledge she has acquired over the years out of a curiosity to figure out her personal wiring. “[It’s about] why I act and react the way I do in relationships—not just romantic love—but with my kids, with my family, and even with the people that I have just met.” Since her early years growing up in Montreal, Grégoire Trudeau says that she has always sought connection — primarily because she spent a lot of time alone as an only child. Her loneliness made her attuned more to her parents’ emotions: she sensed a sadness in her mother and tried to be sympathetic, but at the same time she also tried to understand her father’s “complete emotional absence.” She would learn years later that her father was suffering in his own way from family trauma which included the aftermath of a boating accident that took place when he was a young adult. “There’s a generational trauma that gets passed down,” she relates. “That’s what sets the tone for us.” Nobody’s childhood is completely behind them—this is what I learned in writing this bookSophie Grégoire Trudeau Whining wasn’t something that was tolerated in her household, so Grégoire Trudeau learned to quickly shift from one emotional state to another. “Did I disassociate from my emotions?” she muses when I put the question to her. “I’m sure I learned to push my emotions away. I don’t particularly like conflict. It makes me emotional now when you ask me that,” she says. “Every child wants to please their parents. We want their love.” Grégoire Trudeau can still relate to the little girl who would count the flowers on the wall-covering in her bedroom whenever her parents argued as a way to distract herself from the tension. “I’m aware of her and I do see her pop up,” she tells me. “Nobody’s childhood is completely behind them — this is what I learned in writing this book,” she says. “It doesn’t mean that we are childish or don’t evolve, but it means that the more aware we are of how the child within us is reacting; the more we can give ourselves the validation and nurturing we didn’t receive. It’s not a need that we invented, it’s what we actually need physiologically and neuro-biologically.” Her parents seemed like they had enough to worry about between themselves, so Grégoire Trudeau was determined to be “the perfect daughter” during her teenage years. “I wanted to save my mother from her own insecurities and save my dad from his relationship with himself,” she writes in the book. “I guess that was a lot to carry. I didn’t know then that we can sustain quality relationships only according to our own level of self-awareness. But I thought my strong shoulders and big heart could bear the weight.” On the surface, Grégoire Trudeau’s life at the private all-girls’ school she attended looked ideal. She excelled in her studies and in sports, and she enjoyed the freedom, independence, and social life that came with it. Still, something was off. She wasn’t big into drinking at parties like a lot of her peers (she saw what over-drinking did to some extended family members and had no desire to go down that road), but her addiction to food as a way to numb her feelings was growing. Then there was the irresistible pressure to be thin. “My mom was very obsessed with her physical appearance,” she tells me. “She was—she is—a very beautiful woman. She was very petite. I had integrated concepts of external beauty: the magazines I was looking at; the magazines my mother was buying. We’re all kind of sucked in by the machine, right?” But because having the “perfect” body could not coexist with eating to excess, it created the perfect storm for a full-blown eating disorder. “I got lots of positive reinforcement when I kept my weight on the low side,” she writes. “So I internalized that concept and the pressure that accompanied it. I hid from the outside world, and bathrooms became a twisted safe haven.” 'You don’t have to do this to yourself. You gotta get out.'Sophie Grégoire Trudeau By the time she was in her late teens, she said that nobody knew about this secret life — save for one best friend who couldn’t really help her because she was going through body struggles of her own. A turning point came one night during her second year of junior college. She was at home and had purged too long and too hard and was left shaken by the ordeal. “I was in my bedroom and I called my mom,” she tells me. “It started so intimately inside of me where I saw myself suffering. I think I parented myself at that moment. I talked to ‘Little Sophie,’ and I said: ‘Hey love, it’s enough. You don’t have to do this to yourself. You gotta get out.’” Grégoire Trudeau says the validating response she received from her mother was perhaps her greatest gift of all. Her father showed his love by launching into action and getting her the help she needed. “I never doubted his love,” she says emphatically. “I just needed him to express it more. The intrinsic quality of love is presence. You can’t replace that. That was his way of saying, ‘I got you. I got you, baby, you know?’” Grégoire started going to Sainte-Justine Hospital in Montreal and began to see a therapist. “I started wanting to change my situation. I’m a quick learner,” she says with a laugh. “And I think that I was kind of curious and adventurous enough to go inside.” When she was a young radio and television host, Grégoire Trudeau decided to go public about her past struggles with an eating disorder. This was 20 years ago — a time when people weren’t really talking about mental health, let alone eating disorders. “That’s when my friend who I went to school with asked me if I wanted to get involved with BACA [an eating disorder treatment centre in Montreal] which she founded. I said I would help out and she asked me if I would tell my story. I sat with it, but I knew it was the right thing to do.” Therapy has guided her along many intersections of her life—including when she was dating the former prime minister. She wanted to get counselling to unearth the deeper worries and emotional patterns that made her feel stuck in the relationship. “I don’t believe any relationship is perfect,” she says. “I would be very surprised to hear of a relationship that never had any kind of conflict. Let me know the secret!” she says with a hearty laugh. “But I was always curious. Because I started therapy when I was quite young, I didn’t lose that curiosity and I wanted to understand why I was struggling inside in different ways.” Grégoire Trudeau tells me that she didn’t “choose her father” in a life partner, so she didn’t relive that dynamic. “But I did choose a human being with qualities and flaws; [someone] who is willing to look within — who actually did years of psychotherapy to become more aware of his inner experiences.” She began experiencing panic attacks a few months before she married Trudeau. Not because she was anxious about getting married — but because her parents announced they were ending their marriage. She writes that she lost the anchor of her original family just before she was about to begin a new one. Just because you restructure a relationship, it doesn’t mean you have to kill it. We are still bound by loveSophie Grégoire Trudeau Grégoire Trudeau’s symptoms were typical of what many people who suffer from panic attacks feel. “All of the sudden I felt very overwhelmed; I felt weak, and had a very dry mouth. I also had a very fast heartbeat: it was a tachycardia issue,” she tells me. “I had to get checked up and everything, but now I know how to look for the signs.” Although she hasn’t had any “episodes” since then, she is very mindful of when she is feeling stressed or anxious. “I’ll slow down and practice conscious breathing,” she says. She also meditates and avidly practices yoga (she’s a certified yoga teacher). “I wouldn’t be sitting here in front of you with so much ease if I wasn’t practicing,” she says. Gregoire Trudeau's separation from her husband of 18 years has allowed her to understand herself on a whole new level. “I have never been more attuned and caring of my mental health than through this whole process,” she tells me. “I have been pushed to dig into my authenticity and to put my attachment issues aside. But just because you restructure a relationship, it doesn’t mean you have to kill it. We are still bound by love.” That doesn’t mean she’s past the pain. “It hurts,” she adds, her eyes filling up with tears. “But when you have love and respect for real, you learn that at some point, you have to set them free. But it’s hard. It’s hard. But still full of love.” The book comes out just in time for Grégoire Trudeau’s 49th birthday. As she looks at life on the cusp of a new decade, she feels there is a maturity in accepting the uncertainty of it. “I’m not fully enlightened, okay?” she quips. “But I know that life comes in chapters. I’m OK with the uncertainty.” As a fellow Taurus, I joke that not knowing what’s next has got to be her biggest pet peeve. “I don’t love it,” she acknowledges with amusement. “But I’m OK.” Let us know what you think by commenting below and tweeting @YahooStyleCA!

Scientists analyzed water samples flowing through eight large publicly owned wastewater plants across the US, all of similar size and using similar technologies to those serving 70% of the population. Even with advanced treatment technologies, they found forever chemicals and compounds able to transform into them were being discharged into rivers and lakes where they can reenter the drinking water supply. Roughly 23 million Americans could be exposed to these forever chemicals from wastewater alone, the study found. “We’re identifying really large amounts of chemicals that we know very little about,” said Bridger Ruyle, an environmental engineering scientist at NYU and an author of the study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. This is especially concerning as treated wastewater is expected to make up an increasing proportion of drinking water supplies as climate change-fueled drought shrinks water sources, Ruyle told CNN. Forever chemicals are so-called for their ability to stay in the environment — and in people’s bodies — for a very long time without breaking down. There are nearly 15,000 of them, known collectively as PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances. Since the 1950s, PFAS have been used in a huge range of consumer products, prized for their ability to resist oil, grease, heat and water. They make clothes waterproof, carpets stain-resistant and pans non-stick. But their prolific use has come at a cost. Even at very low levels, they have been linked to a range of health conditions, including thyroid problems, infertility and some cancers. People are exposed to PFAS in many ways, but drinking water is an important one. Almost half the tap water in the US is contaminated, according to a 2023 study. Wastewater treatment plants play a major role, Ruyle said. They receive PFAS-contaminated water from homes and industry and about 50% of drinking water plants in the US are downstream from one of them, he added. In 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency introduced rules to dramatically reduce concentrations of six PFAS in drinking water. However, the study found the chemicals the EPA regulates made up only about 8% of the potentially hazardous compounds found in the water samples analyzed. The majority comprised unregulated chemicals including other PFAS and pharmaceuticals. Drug companies use compounds classified as PFAS because they are very hard to degrade, Ruyle said. This can increase the concentration of drugs in people’s bodies. While that’s an advantage for the effectiveness of the drugs, it’s a problem everywhere else. A molecule that’s hard to degrade in the body, is also hard to degrade in a wastewater plant or in rivers and lakes, Ruyle said. The study also found climate change could increase exposure. Lakes and rivers shrink during drought, but the amount of wastewater humans produce does not, Ruyle said. This means there is less natural water to dilute the chemicals in wastewater before it enters drinking water plants. In many parts of the country, especially those susceptible to drought, water reuse is already an important source of drinking water, said David Andrews, acting chief science officer at the Environmental Working Group, which monitors exposure to chemicals including PFAS. “These water systems are particularly vulnerable,” said Andrews, who was not involved in the study. “This study highlights how wastewater treatment plants are not currently equipped to clean up the contamination,” he told CNN. Denis O’Carroll, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of New South Wales, also not involved in the research, said the study “suggests that many PFAS go undetected using traditional laboratory methods.” He told CNN the analysis was consistent with his own recent research which found PFAS levels in surface and groundwater around the world are being underestimated. The study is also significant because it quantifies different sources of PFAS at wastewater treatment plants and finds those from pharmaceuticals “may be of concern,” he said. It’s important to understand the sources of PFAS in order to reduce them he added. Much more research is still needed, Ruyle said. “There is a really large universe of PFAS that are much more prevalent, that are being found at these major sources, (and) we need to get an understanding of what their own health risks are,” he said. There are actions people can take, including filtering tap water. But experts say the best solution is find ways to stop PFAS entering the environment in the first place. “We need to address the problem at the source,” Ruyle said, “rather than installing even more advanced, more expensive, more resource-intensive technologies at drinking water utilities or asking people to buy specialized home treatment systems.” For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",0,[],2025-01-07 01:50:25,2025-01-07 01:50:25

After a successful engine burn test in October, Maine-based bluShift Aerospace is planning for its next big milestone: a suborbital flight test toward the end of 2025. The rocket company, located at Brunswick Landing in southern Maine, was founded over a decade ago. In January of 2021, the company carved its niche in space history when it became the first to commercially use non-toxic biofuel to power its inaugural rocket prototype, Stardust 1.0, on a successful test launch. According to bluShift CEO and founder Sascha Deri, the rocket's ""secret sauce"" fuel contains an agricultural byproduct that can be obtained from farms around the world. After its first successful test of the propulsion technology, bluShift now looks forward to throwing its hat in the commercial launch market, developing propulsion technologies that reduce costs, and even opening its own private launch site in Maine. At the end of October 2024, bluShift achieved its ""biggest milestone"" yet with the completion of a full duration burn of its engine, MAREVL (Modular Adaptable Rocket Engine for Vehicle Launch). ""We've had not one but two successful engine tests, and over the course of last year, we've done a massive overhaul of our test infrastructure. We built our flight-ready 30-foot-tall oxidizer tank and a scalable test infrastructure, which enables us to not only test Starless Rogue today, but also test lighter and lighter weight versions of our MAREVL engine technology in a full vertical stack down the road,"" Deri said in an interview with Space.com. ""We've also been working with the Department of the Air Force to enable us to broaden our market opportunities and sell our engines as booster rockets, non-toxic, re-usable, non-munitions rated boosters to larger launch vehicles, and we're really excited about that. Our MAREVL technology should drastically reduce the overall costs of boosters for this class of launch vehicles"" Deri said the company was able to raise more than $1.4 million recently through private investments and within just the last month, begin a $15 million equity round, which will support the goal of launching its suborbital rocket, named Starless Rogue, from commercially-licensed Spaceport America in New Mexico. ""By the end of [2025], we're looking to do a low altitude launch of Starless Rogue with paying customer payloads on board and we'll probably be doing it from Spaceport America,"" Deri said. ""And that's really the engineering launch, although it will also be revenue generating, and we will recover the rocket. We will re-fly that vehicle to space once we have a commercial launch license with the FAA, which we've kicked off the efforts for already, thanks in part to a grant from the Maine Technology Institute (MTI) ($150,000) to help fund the efforts to get our commercial launch license."" According to Deri, there's work to be done before now and then, starting with planning for more tests including a vertical stack burn of MAREVL during the first half of 2025. bluShift also aims to construct its launch vehicle, Starless Rogue, as well as the launch infrastructure that will be used at Spaceport America during the summer, allowing the company to stay on track to launch in late fall to early winter of 2025. ""If we get our FAA commercial launch license before then we'll just punch it right to space, but my anticipation is that we will still be waiting. We expect that by mid-2026, we'll have received the license and we'll do our launch to space initially targeting between 120 to 140 kilometers (75 to 87 miles) in altitude,"" Deri said. ""After our initial heavy duty Starless Rogue launch, we'll also be upgrading that vehicle with more lightweight components and some technology that will be used in our orbital vehicle to increase its performance further. That will enable us to ultimately go to 350 to 400 kilometers (~217 to 249 miles) in altitude, which means six to eight minutes of zero-G micro-gravity time for our customers' payloads."" In addition to rockets, bluShift hopes to focus in the next several years on establishing an orbital program to launch off the coast of Maine, making it the only private U.S. launch site with direct access to polar and sun-synchronous low Earth orbit (LEO). Deri says the process of establishing a launchpad off of a ""lift boat"" (a boat that can raise itself out of the water to become an offshore platform) this far north on the eastern seaboard will be dependent on funding, and include an environmental analysis and approval from the FAA. ""One of the approaches that we're taking on is crawl, walk, and run (and then dash). Crawl is to get to a supportable launch market and figure out where our competitors are not servicing customers. We found out that the number one niche was not sending people up, but sending research up for more time than anyone else is doing,"" Deri said. ""Walk, that's a clustered booster to enhance the upmass capabilities of medium lift rockets with reusable, less-expensive, non-munition rated engines.""

""Run, that's doing orbital. By that point, we've tested out their ability to launch, and we know how to do launch operations, sales, customer support, work with the FAA, and we've got manufacturing up and running."" ""We know how to run our engines in parallel and we're already working with customers who are even at a suborbital level creating small satellite systems, like CubeSats. And, we knew how to do recovery on the ocean,"" Deri added. Once up and running, bluShift hopes to expand its presence by adding more launch locations using its lift boat concept to allow the company to launch from more locations off the U.S. coasts. Such a capability would enable bluShift to offer versatile launch solutions to different orbits in a quick and responsive fashion.",0,[],2025-01-07 01:50:25,2025-01-07 01:50:25

SpaceX is ready for the next Starship flight test, aiming to make strides toward full reusability of the launch system at the start of what promises to be a massive year for the launcher. Launch from Starbase Orbital Launch Pad A in South Texas is currently scheduled for 5:00 p.m. Eastern (2200 GMT) Jan. 10. The launch window will be open for 97 minutes, with backup days running to Jan. 16. You'll be able to tune into the livestream on Space.com, if SpaceX makes it available as usual. Starship consists of the massive first stage called Super Heavy and an upper-stage spacecraft known as Starship, or simply ""Ship."" The launch from Boca Chica Beach will feature a number of new upgrades and objectives, building on the spectacular Flight Test 6 in November of last year. Most notably, this will be the first time SpaceX attempts to deploy payloads with Starship, using 10 Starlink simulators to test the system's ability to deploy active next-generation Starlink satellites in the future. Deploying next-gen, heavier and more advanced Starlink satellites will be one of the uses of Starship. The simulators will be on the same suborbital trajectory as the Starship upper stage, with Ship targeting a splashdown in the Indian Ocean. In terms of upgrades, the flaps on the Starship upper stage are reduced in size and closer to the tip of the vehicle, reducing their exposure to heat and allowing simplified protective tiling, while redesigns to the propulsion system allow a 25% increase in propellant volume, SpaceX revealed in a statement. ""The ship's heat shield will also use the latest generation tiles and includes a backup layer to protect from missing or damaged tiles,"" the statement says. Super Heavy, meanwhile, will be reusing Raptor engine number 314, which flew on Booster 12 and was spectacularly caught by the tower chopsticks on Flight Test 5, in a small step toward reusability. The aim is for Super Heavy — the 14th booster of its kind — to make a return to the pad for a catch attempt. If the necessary conditions are not met, however, the booster will instead head for the Gulf of Mexico for a landing burn and soft splashdown.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/pluto-captured-largest-moon-charon-160100417.html,How Pluto captured its largest moon Charon with a 10-hour icy 'kiss',,Science,Space,7 min read,"Pluto may have got romantic to capture its largest moon, colliding and engaging in a passionate but icy 10 hour kiss with Charon billions of years ago.",Robert Lea,2025-01-06T16:01:00.000Z,"When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission. New research suggests that billions of years ago, Pluto may have captured its largest moon, Charon, with a very brief icy ""kiss."" The theory could explain how the dwarf planet (yeah, we wish Pluto was still a planet, too) could snare a moon that is around half its size. The team behind this research thinks that two frigid worlds located in the Kuiper Belt, a ring of icy bodies located far from the sun at the edge of the solar system, collided together billions of years ago. Rather than mutually obliterating each other, the two bodies were united as a spinning ""cosmic snowman."" These bodies separated relatively quickly but remained orbitally linked to create the Pluto/Charon system we see today. This ""kiss and capture"" process represents a new theory of moon capture and cosmic collision. It could also help scientists better investigate the structural strength of frigid, icy worlds in the Kuiper Belt. ""We've found that if we assume that Pluto and Charon are bodies with material strength, Pluto can indeed capture Charon from a giant impact,"" team leader and University of Arizona lunar and planetary researcher Adeene Denton told Space.com. ""The process of this collisional capture is called 'kiss-and-capture' because Pluto and Charon briefly merge, the 'kiss' element, before separating to form two independent bodies."" Most planetary collision scenarios are classified as ""hit and run"" or ""graze and merge,"" meaning this ""kiss and capture"" scenario is something entirely new. ""We were definitely surprised by the 'kiss' part of kiss-and-capture,"" Denton continued. ""There hasn't really been a kind of impact before where the two bodies only temporarily merge before re-separating!"" The team's research was published on Monday (Jan. 6) in the journal Nature Geoscience. The reason Pluto's relationship with Charon has been challenging to scientists is because of the relatively small difference in size and mass between the two icy bodies. ""Charon is HUGE relative to Pluto, to the point where they are actually a binary,"" Denton explained. ""It's half Pluto's size and 12% of its mass, which makes it much more similar to the Earth's moon than any other moon in the solar system."" For comparison, our moon is just a quarter of the size of Earth, while the largest moon in the solar system, Ganymede, is around 1/28 the size of its parent planet, Jupiter. The University of Arizona researcher, who is also a NASA postdoctoral fellow, added that it's hard to get such a relatively big moon in a ""normal"" way. (""Normal"" being the gravitational capture of moons like Mars' moons Phobos and Deimos and the moons of the giant planets Jupiter and Saturn.) That means that the prevailing theory of the formation of the Pluto and Charon system is based on the collisional capture idea, similar to how a massive body is believed to have slammed into Earth to launch out material that our planet captured to birth our moon. ""Something big hits Pluto, and you get Charon, but like with the Earth-moon system, we don't fully know how that works and the conditions under which that occurs,"" Denton said. ""It's a pretty big question since a bunch of other large Kuiper Belt Objects also have large moons, so it seems like this is something that happens in the Kuiper Belt with some frequency, but we don't know how or why."" During a standard ""collision capture,"" a massive collision occurs, and the two bodies stretch and deform in a fluid-like way. This process explains the creation of the Earth/moon system well because the intense heat generated in the clash and the greater mass of the bodies involved causes them to act in a fluid way. When considering Pluto and Charon in a collision capture process, there is an extra factor to consider: the structural strength of the colder icy and rocky bodies. This is something that has been neglected in the past when researchers considered the collisional creation of Charon. To factor this into simulations, the team turned to the University of Arizona's high-performance computing cluster. When Denton and colleagues accounted for the strength of these materials in their simulation, something completely unexpected emerged. ""Because both bodies have material strength, Charon did not penetrate deep enough into Pluto to merge with it; this isn't true when the bodies are fluids,"" Denton explained. ""For the same impact conditions, if we assume Pluto and Charon to be strengthless, they do merge into one large body, and Charon is absorbed. With strength, however, Pluto and Charon remain structurally intact during their brief merger."" Because Charon couldn't sink into Pluto in this scenario, it remained beyond the so-called ""co-rotation radius"" of both bodies. As a result, it could not rotate as fast as Pluto, which meant the two bodies could not stay merged. As they separated and this icy kiss ended, the team thinks that Pluto would have torqued Charon into a close, higher circular orbit from which the moon would have migrated outward. ""The 'kiss' in this kiss-and-capture, the merger is very brief, geologically speaking, lasting for 10 to 15 hours before both bodies separate again,"" Denton said. ""Charon then begins its slow outward migration towards its current position."" The team thinks the initial collision happened very early in solar system history, probably tens of millions of years after the solar system formed, which would be billions of years ago. ""Typical large collisions are straightforward mergers, where the bodies combine, or both bodies remain independent,"" Denton said. ""So this was very new to us. It also raised a lot of interesting geological questions that we'd like to test, because whether kiss-and-capture works depends on the thermal state of Pluto, which we can then tie to Pluto's contemporary geology to test. ""I'd really like to determine how the initial Pluto-Charon impact can influence whether and how Pluto and Charon develop oceans."" Related Stories: —Why is Pluto not a planet? —James Webb Space Telescope deciphers the origins of Pluto's icy moon Charon — Celebrating 40 Years of Pluto's Largest Moon, Charon Denton explained that there are two avenues the team can follow to build upon this development. ""The first is looking at how this applies to the other large Kuiper Belt Objects with large moons, like Eris and Dysnomia, Orcus and Vanth, and the others,"" Denton explained. ""Our initial analysis suggests that kiss-and-capture can also be the source of these other systems, but since they're all different in their compositions and mass, it's critical to learn how kiss-and-capture may have operated across the Kuiper Belt.""The second avenue the team intends to follow involves looking at the long-term tidal evolution of Charon to confirm their formation theory. ""To really be sure that this is the process that formed Pluto and Charon, we need to make sure that Charon migrates to its current location at around 8 times the width of Pluto away,"" Denton said.

Astronomers have captured a breathtaking new image of thousands of galaxies, thanks to the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) mounted on the U.S. National Science Foundation's Víctor M. Blanco 4-meter Telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. Focused on the Antlia Cluster — a dense assembly of galaxies within the Hydra–Centaurus Supercluster located around 130 million light-years from Earth — the image captures only a small portion of the 230 galaxies that make up the cluster, revealing a diverse array of galaxy types within as well as thousands of background galaxies beyond. The Dark Energy Camera (DECam) was originally built for the Dark Energy Survey (DES), an international collaboration that began in 2013 and concluded its observations in 2019. Over the course of the survey, scientists mapped hundreds of millions of galaxies in an effort to understand the nature of dark energy — a mysterious force thought to drive the accelerated expansion of our universe. The universe's acceleration challenges predictions made by Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, making dark energy one of the most perplexing mysteries in modern cosmology. Dark matter, meanwhile, refers to the mysterious and invisible substance that seems to hold galaxies together. This is another major conundrum scientists are still trying to fully penetrate. Observations made of galaxy clusters have already helped scientists unravel some of the processes driving galaxy evolution as they search for clues about the history of our universe. In this sense, galaxy clusters act as ""cosmic laboratories"" where gravitational influence driven by dark matter and cosmic expansion driven by dark energy can be studied on incredibly large scales. Galaxy clusters, like the Antila Cluster, are prime hunting grounds for clues about dark matter in particular because, while these clusters contain hundreds of thousands of galaxies, they account for only about 5% of the cluster's total mass. An estimated 80% is thought to be invisible dark matter, whose gravitational pull binds the entire structure together. Thanks to its large size and exceptional sensitivity, DECam has provided astronomers with unprecedented insights into these regions of space. These include detailed observations of the super-heated plasma that fills the space between galaxies — known as the intracluster medium — and faint light emitted by a nearby supernova remnant.

They serve as windows into the fundamental forces shaping our universe. By studying the intricate balance between dark matter and dark energy within these colossal structures, scientists inch closer to understanding the mysterious mechanisms driving cosmic evolution. Each observation brings us a step nearer to answering some of the most profound questions in cosmology, reminding us of the immense complexity and beauty of the universe.",18,[],2025-01-07 01:50:25,2025-01-07 01:50:25

""Yesterday, as we went through our normal player medical process, we did learn that he did have a setback in his Achilles recovery,"" Berry told reporters. ""We don't have all the details and everything yet, but it will obviously extend the recovery process for him. It is new information, [I] just learned about it in the past couple of hours."" According to Berry, Watson, 29, told doctors during his exit physical something did not feel right. Watson is still early in his recovery from the injury and the team did not have a definitive timeline yet for him to resume football activities. Berry said he's still collecting information about Watson's setback, including how it happened. As for the implications for how this could affect Watson's status for training camp or even the start of the 2025 regular season, Berry said, ""it's too early to tell."" Watson planted his right leg in the first half of the Browns' 21-14 loss as he started to scramble and immediately crumpled to the turf in pain. Athletic trainers tended to him on the field as backup quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson warmed up. Watson eventually left the field on a cart. In December, Watson and the Browns agreed to a contract restructure that will not affect the $92 million in fully guaranteed money Watson is owed for the 2025 and 2026 NFL seasons, nor the $72.9 million salary-cap hit he'll have for each season, but it will allow Cleveland to spread his dead money over multiple seasons if he stays with the team through 2026. The alternative was a sizable cap hit in 2027, when Watson will no longer be under contract with the team. Watson has yet to play more than seven games in a season since joining the Browns — having played 19 in total after signing a five-year, $230 million contract in 2022 — and finished his second straight season on the injured list.",393,[],2025-01-07 01:51:55,2025-01-09 00:34:02

Why Nelly Furtado, 46, is embracing body neutrality.",,Lifestyle,Yahoo Life,4 min read,"The 46-year-old singer says she's experienced ""aesthetic pressure"" by the industry.",Kerry JustichReporter,2025-01-06T23:49:21.000Z,"Nelly Furtado is off to a good start with her New Year’s resolutions. “Have a body neutral 2025,” she wrote on Instagram. “Express yourself freely, celebrate your individuality and know that it’s perfectly OK to be OK with what you see in the mirror, and it’s also OK to want something different.” The “Maneater” artist, 46, shared her message on Instagram alongside two bikini photos. In the caption, she reflected on the revelations she’s had about her body and beauty standards. “This year I became aware of the aesthetic pressure of my work in a brand new way, while simultaneously I experienced new levels of self-love and genuine confidence from within,” she said. The photos are a testament to exactly that. “[In] these photos I have no makeup and there is no editing or filters.” While she doesn’t often bare it all on her social media, Furtado seemed to be influenced to do so after revealing that she allegedly pursued legal action against companies who were selling beauty and health services based on “myths about me.” “For whoever cares, I have never had any face or body surgeries or augmentation, besides for veneers on the top row of my teeth, quite recently,” she wrote to set the record straight. Then she went on to practice more transparency about her beauty routines. “So far, I have not had any face or lip injections or fillers of any kind, but I do have a loving, old school facialist who I purchase serums and creams from and I started that when I was 20. The day before photo shoots and red carpets, I drink a lot of water and sleep on my back.” The pressure that celebrities face to look a certain way is no secret. But the tactics that they leverage to appear flawless often are. Here, Furtado pulls back the curtain on some and experts say it’s important. Although the singer says she hasn’t gone under the knife to permanently change her body or face, Furtado is open about other ways that her appearance has been altered. “Sometimes on the red carpet or at photo shoots my makeup artist uses face tape to give my eyes, skin and makeup more lift. Sometimes my stylist uses body tape to give a certain look to different silhouettes,” she wrote. “Body makeup can also sometimes be contoured to achieve a certain look. Makeup can do magical things! So can great eyebrows! So can a great hairstylist! So can great underthings!” Katherine Metzelaar, a registered dietitian specializing in body image, says that Furtado’s transparency is important. Metzelaar tells Yahoo Life: “When celebrities open up about the pressure to look a certain way, it reminds us that these impossible standards affect everyone. Even people who are held up as examples of beauty often don’t feel like they measure up. Hearing that from someone in the spotlight can be powerful.” She also says: We’re so used to seeing perfect images and thinking they’re natural when, in reality, there’s often a lot of effort, a ton of money, and professional help behind those looks.” Furtado’s unedited photos, in turn, provide a more relatable and realistic portrayal. “I have spider veins and they remind me of my mom and aunties and life so I think that’s why I haven’t parted with them so far,” the singer noted in the caption, inspiring a commenter to share that she too appreciates her spider veins for that same reason. Calling 2025 a body neutral year might allow Furtado to experience less pressure about her appearance. The principle is based on the idea that you don’t have to love or hate your body, but instead just let it be, says therapist Isabella Shirinyan. “Instead of constantly striving to feel beautiful or battling feelings of inadequacy, body neutrality shifts the focus to what your body does for you rather than how it looks. It helps you break free from the exhausting cycle of self-criticism and external validation, and instead allows space to exist without your worth being tied to your appearance,” she tells Yahoo Life. “It shifts the focus away from perfection and toward function, self-trust and reclaiming autonomy over our bodies in a world that constantly tells us we need to fix them.” Spider veins or not, Furtado and others practicing body neutrality can feel confident in who they are and what they have to offer outside of their body’s shape or size. As the singer puts it, “We are all cute little humans just bouncing around the earth looking for hugs.”",0,[],2025-01-07 01:53:14,2025-01-07 01:53:14

Is a return to Washington, D.C. next?",jason owens,2025-01-07T00:08:57.000Z,"Armed with the Rookie of the Year favorite at quarterback under the fledgling ownership of Josh Harris, the Washington Commanders are headed for the postseason and generating excitement rarely seen since the franchise's 1980s and early 90s heyday. Is a return from Maryland to Washington, D.C. next? A bill that was previously passed by Congress and signed by President Joe Biden on Monday paves the way. Biden signed the RFK Memorial Stadium Campus Revitalization Act into law on Monday, weeks after it passed in the U.S. Senate. The law transfers control of the RFK Stadium site in Washington from the federal government to local District of Columbia authorities. In short, it opens the door for a new stadium to be built at the old RFK stadium site that hosted the franchise during its Joe Gibbs-era glory days. Biden's signature concludes a contentious saga around the act that was initially included as a provision in a short-term government funding package to avert a shutdown before being scuttled in Congress via an effort by President-elect Donald Trump and his ally Elon Musk on Dec 17. The bill passed as a standalone act via a unanimous vote of the U.S. Senate on Dec. 21. Biden's signature was the last step in making the bill a law. Harris joined Biden in the White House on Monday for a signing ceremony in the Oval Office. President Biden’s signature of the “D.C. Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium Campus Revitalization Act” is a big win for Washington, D.C. and its residents. Washington can finally move forward on a new vision for the RFK site. We look forward to being a part of that… pic.twitter.com/2OxUJjlXzS — Washington Commanders (@Commanders) January 6, 2025 ""President Biden’s signature of the 'D.C. Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium Campus Revitalization Act' is a big win for Washington, D.C. and its residents,"" a Commanders statement reads. ""Washington can finally move forward on a new vision for the RFK site. We look forward to being a part of that conversation as we evaluate a future home for the Washington Commanders."" RFK Stadium is located on the east side of Washington, D.C. alongside the Anacostia River. It hosted the franchise from 1961 to 1996, a timeframe that saw Washington advance to five Super Bowls and win three. Gibbs led Washington to four of those Super Bowl appearances and all three wins in a 10-year span from 1982-91. The franchise moved in 1997 to its current home in Landover, Maryland that was known primarily known as FedEx Field before being renamed Northwest Stadium when FedEx ended its naming-rights agreement in 2024. The stadium is frequently derided as one of the NFL's worst and is largely associated with the dysfunctional ownership era of Dan Snyder (1999-2022) known for losing on the field and scandal off of it. As the franchise languished under Snyder, the RFK Stadium site fell into disrepair while under the control of the federal government. The stadium has sat vacant since 2019 and has been approved for demolition, though it remains intact. Harris, a childhood fan of the team who took controlling ownership in 2023, has made the franchise's return to D.C. a priority since buying the Commanders. ""Some of my earliest memories were of Washington football and walking into RFK,"" Harris said in 2024, per NBC Washington.""... I lived through all of that, right? I'm incredibly motivated to bring it back, and so this is emotional for me. You know, it's not just business. It's about the city, the franchise, the fans, and doing what's right to bring the team back to where it needs to be."" A potential move back to D.C. has involved political bickering and maneuvering on state, federal and municipal levels including an unorthodox proposal in December from Maryland's U.S. senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen. The senators asked for the District to trade fighter jets to Maryland in exchange for their cooperation in approving the bill to clear the transfer of the RFK Stadium site. Maryland got its fighter jets, per a Dec. 21 statement from the U.S. Air Force: “The Air Force has agreed to transfer the 121st Fighter Squadron from the DC Air National Guard to the Maryland Air National Guard."" The path for the Commanders' return been cleared. Now comes the hard part — actually planning and building a stadium and moving the team. In the meantime, the Commanders and their fans can revel in the excitement generated by Jayden Daniels and their first playoff appearance since the 2020 season.",183,[],2025-01-07 01:53:14,2025-01-09 00:34:07

The Lions had just beaten the Vikings 31-9 to grab the NFC North title and the No. 1 overall seed in the NFC playoffs. If the teams meet again in two weeks, it’ll be right in the same place, a deafening building in downtown Detroit. Campbell’s team was headed into a much-needed bye week; to the victors go the rest and recovery. Meanwhile, O’Connell’s club was spinning in another direction, and not just off to Los Angeles as the fifth-seed to face the Los Angeles Rams next Monday night in the wild-card round. Suddenly this was a 14-3 team with doubts and demons rising up. It was the byproduct of a dreadful night of quarterback play by Sam Darnold and a franchise history that is tortured enough to know a problem when it sees it. This will be Minnesota’s 24th playoff appearance since 1976 when Fran Tarkenton and the Purple People Eaters lost for a fourth time in the Super Bowl. The Vikings haven’t been back to the big game since. They’ve bowed out in every imaginable way — as favorites, as upstarts, as divisional champs and as a 15-1 team. They've lost with talents such as Randy Moss, Adrian Peterson and Brett Favre. If it wasn't one thing, it was another. They are part of a city that has four major professional men’s sports franchises but not a single title since the Twins won the World Series in 1991. Much is (rightfully) made of long-suffering Lions fans, but at least many of them could crossover and enjoy the success of the Red Wings' or Pistons' title runs this century. Not so in the Twin Cities. That likely contributed to the panic that crept though Vikings fans on Sunday, when Darnold, the out-of-nowhere quarterback star/savior of the season began looking like his old New York Jets ghost-seeing days. Detroit’s injury-riddled defense had been mostly a sieve of late, surrendering 31 to Green Bay, 34 to San Francisco and 48 to Buffalo. Yet Minnesota managed just 9, got stopped from scoring a touchdown in four red zone trips and gained just 262 yards. Yes, the Lions got back linebacker Alex Anzalone to help in the middle of the field and defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn dialed up a genius game plan. Credit to them. But this was also on Darnold — who threw high, who threw late, who threw it out of bounds. He had Justin Jefferson open multiple times for scores only to toss it where the guy who can catch anything couldn’t catch it. He had Jordan Addison open another time and didn’t pass it. “Just got to hit the throws, it’s as simple as that,” Darnold said afterward. He finished just 18-of-41 for a season-low 166 yards. Darnold entered the game completing 67.7 percent of his passes, to hit just 43.9 against the Lions. He promised to go back to the fundamentals to improve his accuracy. “I think for me, personally, I’ve got to look at the tape, see just my feet and just correct everything from a mechanics standpoint — not look too deep into it, but just get better,” Darnold explained. It's great that he owned the loss, but who wants a QB searching for proper footwork heading into the playoffs? In a calm world, everyone would exhale and remember this team won 14 games this season. This is the NFL, though, overreaction is a way of life and Vikings fans have been burned too many times to ignore what they saw. If Darnold is playing like that, this may not last long. Getting back to Detroit in two weeks — perhaps once considered a formality — is not guaranteed. “Early on in the game, it seemed the misses were a little high, so we’ve got to take a look at it, fundamentals, techniques, and take a look at the plays that things happened on,” O’Connell said. “Having the Monday night game, we’ll be able to do — we’ll be able to have a real full kind of debrief and understanding of what took place because clearly it starts with me … “Sam has hit a lot of those plays all year and I have every bit of confidence that he will hit it the next time,"" O’Connell continued. O’Connell’s stated confidence may be rewarded. Maybe the Sam Darnold that was among the NFL’s best stories this season returns to that form. Or maybe this is the inevitable regression to the mean for a 27-year-old on his fourth team. Only Darnold can determine that, but across 60 minutes on Sunday night in Detroit, the Vikings went from dreaming of everything to shaking off the nightmares of seasons' past. All while wondering which Sam Darnold will show up in the playoffs.",214,[],2025-01-07 02:26:31,2025-01-09 00:34:14

I wasn’t even surprised. Abreu has now been jailed for 15 months. Having served time myself, for four months in 2022, I understood exactly why these things might happen. In fact, I even had a very quick “bonk” myself – albeit with a fellow inmate and not a prison officer. My brief, 48-hour “relationship” with her now seems totally surreal and completely at odds with the person I am. But I want to open up about it because most people have no understanding of what goes on in prisons. I certainly didn’t. And it was a brutal eye-opener that changed me forever. I don’t think I am remotely special or in any way superior. I am not. I committed a crime and was rightly punished for it. But as an “atypical” prisoner – who was fortunate (unlike the vast majority) to have come from a loving family and with a private school education – I see it as my duty to try and increase understanding. I’m not a lesbian and never have been. Yet prison is such a bizarre experience that after a while you simply stop being the person you’ve always thought you were. Instead, you become the seven digit number you are given on arrival. Devoid of regular contact with family and friends along with the outside world you become desperate to do something, anything, that makes you feel human. And is there anything that more epitomises being human than sex? Inside there are cameras everywhere; you are under 24-hour surveillance. You aren’t allowed to hug or even comfort someone when they’re upset. Going weeks without human touch is horribly isolating. You begin to crave it, in whatever form it takes. Someone else’s smell and feeling another person next to you. You are starved of anything sensory there – under the harsh striplights there’s no tastes or smells other than the loo or bleach. In my normal life, the type of men I’ve dated are high-flying, attractive and charming. The very opposite of Adele*, who was butch and had piercings and tattoos. She’d been in and out of prison several times so had a confidence about her, which was attractive. She had a certain “street” style (as much as that’s possible inside) with the way she carried herself. Without wishing to come across as a terrible snob, in my regular life back then – as a 37-year-old Pilates teacher and exercise physiologist – our paths would never have crossed. Then, after three months inside, I was suddenly lusting after her in a novel, primal sort of way. Normally I let the man make the first move. But, instead, I was the one to pass her a note, just an in-joke I knew would make her laugh. The build-up to that note had been nothing more than merely a lot of eye contact, intense staring, a knowing smile or the tiniest exchange. It sounds ridiculously childish but you are infantilised in prison, and behaviours revert to those of school children. You are also incredibly bored, so even these miniscule events become enough to sustain you, to give you something to think about for long hours in your cell: “Does she fancy me?” In response to my note she scribbled one in return. She was fairly illiterate (the average literacy age of inmates is just 11 after all) so it was hardly Shakespeare, and yet, pathetically, it brightened my week. Somehow, emboldened by raging hormones, we were brave enough to grab a rare chance to slip into her cell a few days later and close the door before anyone checked. It was risky, and it was over in minutes. But, my God, it was thrilling. In the grey bubble of prison life I fleetingly felt something resembling being alive. It wasn’t a love affair, within two days it all stopped after I was jolted on hearing her refer to me as “her missus”. I thought, what the hell am I doing? I’d ended up in prison because, in 2019, I had received two speeding fines and had lied about who was driving. I was charged with perverting the course of justice, and in March 2022, I stood in the dock, wearing my smartest black dress, and pleaded guilty. I was sentenced to 16 months in prison and ended up serving four. I am not proud of myself and, at that time, life was chaotic. I seemed to lurch from one drama to another, letting myself down as well as those around me. I had no idea what to expect or which prison I would be taken to. Still in all my smart court clothes, I was transported in a “sweat box”, a sort of transportable cell, in a high-security van. Seeing unidentifiable countryside flash by felt utterly terrifying. Once I arrived, I was offered XL tracksuit bottoms which wouldn’t stay up, and some knickers that were also too big. The mortification of asking a male officer for sanitary ware, then having to explain I didn’t have any suitable underwear to stick them onto, was the first blow to my dignity, but far from the last. When I had Covid, I wasn’t allowed out of my cell for a week. They wouldn’t give me enough paracetamol for that night’s fever in case I overdosed. Frequently, the facilities ran out of loo paper. Technically you’re allowed to use the gym three times a week, which sounds fine, but then you soon realise that it’s a choice between that, a shower, or feeling sunlight on your face briefly – and the gym soon goes out the (barred) window. You have to handwrite any emails on paper for someone else to send. The food allowance per prisoner is just £1.87 a day, split between three meals. You realise that prison “slop” is quite literal. I was allocated a cell and a quaint-sounding “pad mate” to share it with. Luckily she was great, and became a much needed ally during my time inside. Unlike men’s prisons which are classified by the severity of the crime, female prisons are all lumped together – whether we’re murderers, armed robbers or fraudsters. And because prisons are so short-staffed, if a high-profile case comes in, as happened while I was there, all the resources are diverted accordingly. We remained locked up for that entire day. Pushed our meals though the hatch like animals. But I was never scared of the other prisoners. Instead, I found the staff the most threatening people there. They liked to be called “Sir” or “Miss”, but I couldn’t bear to: I wasn’t aged four and they weren’t God, so I stuck with a respectable “officer”. I saw a young woman beaten once by the staff, and when I reported it anonymously, I was told it wouldn’t be processed unless I put a name to it. I was too scared that if I did, the same fate would await me. Many inmates have Subutex (an opioid substitute) addictions and crippling mental health issues – and is it any wonder? While I was in custody, two women in the space of one week took their own lives. But, amongst the fear, there is a lot of sheer boredom and complete frustration. So can you blame anyone for wanting the light relief of some affection and warmth in any kind of micro relationship you can manage to have? Brief moments of lesbianism like mine even have a prison name: “Going gay for the stay.” So if you think people don’t have sex in prison, think again. We all do. Unlike many female prisoners, who were raised in care or, as 53 per cent are, sexually abused, I did not have this excuse. I was raised in Sheffield by loving, socially mobile parents, a hairdresser mum and businessman dad. After my private school education, I went to a prestigious London ballet school at the age of 16. People think ballet is all fluffy tutus. It’s not. You need grit to survive the 12 hours of training, six days a week. I was too young to be living independently. By my 20s I’d re-trained as a Pilates teacher, was living with anorexia and had fallen into a toxic relationship with an older man. I’d begun self medicating with cocaine, pathological lying about where I was getting cash and my lifestyle. Once that addiction had taken its grip, I made terrible choices while feeding my habit. Thankfully, a stint in a drug rehabilitation centre for nine months sorted my addiction out. But admittedly, my life was chaotic in the build-up to my imprisonment. To my mind, I got what I deserved. My four months inside were utter hell, and changed me forever. The sound of lorries reversing on the street still makes me jolt upright in bed sweating as it sounds exactly like the beep-beep-beep of the security van I was transported in. The fact that so many prisoners re-offend doesn’t surprise me. You wouldn’t expect an abused puppy to be locked up and emerge a well behaved dog, so why would you think a human would be any different? My experience left me so horrified by how inhumanely women are treated I became determined to do something about it. I realised I had so much privilege compared to others and knew I had to put it to good use and make a difference. I wondered about working with prisoners initially, but then decided it would be better for me to use my background in movement and physical rehabilitation to improve mental health in adolescents, and ensure they never enter our prison system in the first place. It’s been nearly two years since I was released and I’ve had to pick up my life and work from scratch, but I’ve found my calling. After coming out, I researched the pipeline from schools to prisons. My first cohort study was a group of adolescents identified by their GP as at high risk of self-harm. Treatments currently offered – pharmaceutical drugs and therapy – are expensive, inefficient and come with long waiting lists. Exercise, which I teach them, improves both physical and mental health with no side effects. And it’s free. The results from this study was picked up by the NHS and they’re piloting the movement for adolescent mental health scheme from September. I was awarded membership of the Churchill Fellowship, a UK charity of which the King is a patron. On July 3, I was officially made a fellow and it was the proudest moment of my life. It means I will travel to other countries learning from the world and bring that knowledge back to the UK. It’s finally given me the purpose in life that I’ve lacked. I turned 40 recently. While I cannot undo my past, I want to do everything I can to improve other women’s futures.

Find...",Karen Doyle,2025-01-06T13:00:26.000Z,"During his 2024 presidential campaign, President-elect Donald Trump suggested that he is considering instituting a policy of tariffs that would lead to the elimination of the federal income tax. Find Out: If Trump Eliminates the Department of Education, Do You Still Have To Pay Your Student Loans? For You: The Trump Economy Begins: 5 Money Moves the Middle Class Should Make Before Inauguration Day While the idea of eliminating income taxes sounds appealing to a lot of people, here’s what it would mean for the economy and your wallet. A tariff is a tax that is levied on imported goods. It is typically used to increase the cost of foreign-made products, particularly those that come from countries that have significantly lower labor and materials costs, or those who allow unfair trade practices. The effect of a tariff is to level the playing field for domestic companies who keep jobs local and are subject to the labor laws of the United States. Tariffs are paid to the U.S. government before foreign goods can be brought into the country. The additional cost incurred by the foreign manufacturer would then be passed on to the consumer in the form of a higher retail price. During Trump’s presidential term, he used tariffs to increase the cost of goods made in China, so that American goods could be priced more competitively. Trending Now: Here’s What Could Happen to Your Money in Trump’s First 40 Days in Office If all imported products coming in to the United States had increased tariffs, there would be short-term and long-term impacts. The short-term impact would be that prices would rise on all imported goods. Consumers could opt to either pay the higher price for the imported product or choose a domestic product, which would also typically have a higher price than the pre-tariff imported product. No matter which choice the consumer makes, the price they would pay would be higher than the previous price of the imported product. So overall prices will rise. The longer-term effect would be a reduction in the quantity of foreign goods imported into the United States. The law of supply and demand tells us that when prices go up, demand goes down and this, after all, is the goal of the tariff — to reduce imports. There will be fewer imported goods available in the United States, which could also drive up prices overall. The concept of replacing income taxes with the revenue from tariffs also has short- and long-term impacts. In the short term, the ‘all-tariff’ plan would act as a consumption tax — a sales tax on steroids, if you will. Because the cost of a tariff is passed on to the consumer, and consumer prices will go up, consumers are paying more for everything they buy. This type of consumption tax affects lower-income consumers on a disproportionate basis. People who spend a higher percentage of their income on necessities — housing, utilities, food, clothing, etc. — would pay a higher amount in tariffs, relatively speaking. Those who spend less on necessities, or who earn income from investments, would pay less. On a longer-term basis, the intended effect of a tariff is to reduce the amount of imported goods. So, the all-tariff plan might eliminate the need for income taxes in the short term, but if it works as intended, it should bring in less money over time. The current income tax system in the U.S. is designed to bring in more money over time, as incomes rise. Tax-weary consumers might think that replacing income tax with tariffs would be a good thing for them. The truth is, it will benefit the wealthy far more than the lower and middle classes. Here’s an example. Two families, the Smiths and the Joneses, each have the same monthly necessary expenses, except for their mortgages, of $6250, which adds up to $75,000 a year. (We’ll exclude their housing costs from this exercise, since housing wouldn’t be affected by a tariff.) The Smiths have an annual income of $150,000, which barely covers their expenses. The Joneses, on the other hand, have an annual income of $300,000, which allows them to easily cover expenses and put some money into savings. So, the Smiths are paying a higher percentage of their income on necessities. Under a tariff only plan, each family would pay the same amount — they have equal monthly expenses excluding housing, so the increase they would see from tariffs would be the same. Yet the Joneses have double the annual income of the Smiths. Under the current progressive income tax system in the United States, a family earning $300,000 per year would pay more than a family making $150,000 a year. Replacing the income tax system with a tariffs-only system turns this on its head and shifts the burden from higher-earning households to those that earn less. As appealing as eliminating federal income taxes might sound to middle- and lower-income taxpayers, an all-tariff system would benefit the wealthy to a far greater degree.

A celebration of film and television, the show is all-encompassing and usually a little cheekier than most, thanks to a long ceremony and boozy dinner. It also marks the first red carpet of the year and a style harbinger of what trends we’ll see celebrities embracing as they promote their projects, attend galas, and accept various accolades throughout 2025. Tonight, all signs point to an enthusiastic return to glamour in all of its glory—shimmery textures, elegant silhouettes, and embellished evening jackets. The best looks this evening were considered and not too try-hard, striking but not over-the-top or camp like so much of the method dressing we’ve seen over the last few years. The event's best-dressed are simply enchanting, and no doubt they’ll keep that allure turned up and turned out for the rest of the season. Below are the stars of this year’s Golden Globes red carpet.  Barbaro, who stars in A Complete Unknown as singer Joan Baez, is newer to the red carpet scene than most of her peers on the list tonight, but she showed up to play in this perfect strapless Dior gown. The subtle transparent and pleating are simply lovely.  Saldaña won the first Golden Globe of the night for her supporting role in Emilia Perez, wearing a strapless deep V-neck sequined gown and voluminous cape off-the-shoulder. On the red carpet and on stage tonight, she embodied the hard-to-achieve synergy between old and new Hollywood glamour.  Tilda in a Chanel jacket. No notes.  This was the finale dress from Seán McGirr's Spring 2025 collection for McQueen, his sophomore outing as creative director for the label. Jolie wears it impeccably, dripping in tangled crystals like the diva she is—no Maria Callas cosplay necessary.  Blanchett rarely misses on the red carpet, and her gilded Vuitton look tonight was one of her best. It was also the second time she wore it. (The first was during the Cannes film festival last spring.) The Grecian draping, column skirt, and intricate beading at the shoulder were slightly updated and made for truly divine fashion. Big kudos to her for re-wearing.  As a colleague pointed out in our Golden Globes fashion Slack channel, Demna knows how to design for the red carpet better than most. Michelle Yeoh has been one of his greatest muses and tonight, in a high neck and mermaid-shaped ruched gown, she nailed it again.  Again, Demna. Nicole Kidman's one-shouldered silver dress looks like it might fall off of her at any moment, in the most incredible way possible. She looks heavenly, with a little wink. Get it, baby girl.  Chic is a totally overused word when it comes to describing red carpet dressing, but some moments just call for it, at least in its purest form. Kirsten Dunst in Gucci this evening is the IYKYK kind of chic.  Stone turned up to the Globes this evening with a very cool new pixie cut and a stunning red Vuitton gown cinched at the waist with a sculptural satin belt. Hands in her pockets, Stone looked cool, her glow even more pronounced thanks to the fact that she didn't wear any jewelry.  Demi Moore had an extraordinary year thanks to her starring role in The Substance, a film that explores the constructs and illusions of aging and beauty. Her shimmery, strapless Armani Privè gown might be something her character Elisabeth Sparkle would have worn in her glory days. On Moore, it is timeless and stunning, fit for an actress whose star will always burn bright.  Gomez looked incredible in this ice-blue satin column gown with geometric paneling on the skirt. A front-runner for awards season for her starring role in Emilia Perez, she will undoubtedly have one of her most successful years yet. And if she keeps dressing like this, she'll become a bonafide style icon, too.

Monday, Wayne shared a video from his appointment at the Cleveland Clinic to his social media page. “Another part of this cancer journey. It is no joke. As I said before, they took a bone from my fibula to put it in my jaw as well as a graft,” he said. “Right now, the only pain that I have is the pain when I walk because of the fibula, where the bone was taken from the fibula and put in here,” Wayne said, gesturing to his jaw. In the video, a Cleveland Clinic nurse named Kelly is taking off tissue that didn’t survive the graft, which she says will promote healing.

The police did not say who the three men were other than they were visiting the school from northwestern Katsina state, one of the states worst hit by armed violence in northern Nigeria. Nigeria’s capital Abuja has in recent years faced growing security threats and attacks that local authorities often attribute to armed groups from surrounding states, most of which are hard hit with violence. Northern Nigeria, where Abuja is located, has suffered similar explosions in recent years, including in June last year when suicide bombers targeted a wedding, a funeral of the victims and a hospital treating the injured.
